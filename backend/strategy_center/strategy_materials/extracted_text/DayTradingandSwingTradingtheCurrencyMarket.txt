ixPREFACE
Day Trading and Swing Trading the Currency Market is one of the most popular books
for new and experienced forex traders. In the third edition, all of the content
has been updated with new chapters and strategies. After having taught seminars
across the country on how to trade currencies, I am repeatedly approached about
recommendations for good books on currency trading. Day Trading Strategies for
the FX Market addresses that need by not only providing technical and fundamental
strategies for trading FX, but also giving traders more detailed insight into how
the currency market works. This book is designed for both the beginner and
advanced trader. There is something for every type of reader. Aside from the
basic market overview, the book covers the best times to trade currencies, the
most market moving economic data cross-mar ket correlations, and unique currency
characteristics just to name a few. For technical traders, there are strategies for both
breakouts and range trading that work particularly well in the FX market.

1CHAPTER 1
Foreign Exchange—
The Fastest Growing
Market of Our Time
The foreign exchange market is the largest and fastest growing market in the
world. Traditionally, it is the platform through which governments, businesses,
investors, travelers, and other interested parties convert or ‘‘exchange’’ currency.
At its most fundamental level, the foreign exchange market is an over-the-counter
(OTC) market with no central exchange and clearing house where orders are
matched. FX dealers and market makers around the world are linked to each other
around-the-clock via telephone, computer, and fax, creating one cohesive market.
Through the years, this has changed with many institutions offering exchange traded
FX instruments, but all of the prices are still derived from the underlying or spot
forex market.
In the past two decades, foreign exchange, also known as forex orFX,became
available to trade by individual retail investors, and this access caused the market
to explode in popularity. In the early 2000s, the Bank of International Settlements
reported a 57% increase in volume between Ap ril 2001 and 2004. At the time more
than $1.9 trillion were changing hands on a daily basis. After the ﬁnancial crisis in
2008, the pace of growth eased to a still- respectable 32% between 2010 and 2013,
but the actual volume that changed hands was signiﬁcantly larger at an average of
$5.3 trillion per day. To put this into perspective, it is 50 times greater than the
daily trading volume of the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ combined.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET2While the growth of the retail foreign exchange market contributed to this surge
in volume, an increase in volatility over the past few years also made investors
more aware of how currency movements can impact the equity and bond markets.
If stocks, bonds, and commodity traders want to make more educated trading
decisions, it is important for them to also follow forex movements. What follows
are some of the examples of how currency ﬂuctuations impacted stock and bond
market movements in past years.
■EURUSD and Corporate Proﬁtability
For stock market traders, particularly those who invest in European corporations that
export a tremendous amount of goods to the United States, monitoring exchange
rates are essential to predicting earnings and corporate proﬁtability. Throughout 2003
and 2004, European manufacturers complained extensively about the rapid rise in the
euro and the weakness in the U.S. dollar. The main culprit for the dollar’s selloff at
the time was the country’s rapidly growing trade and budget deﬁcits. This caused the
EURUSD exchange rate to surge, which took a signiﬁcant toll on the proﬁtability of
European corporations because a higher exchange rate makes the goods of European
exporters more expensive to U.S. consumers. In 2003, inadequate hedging shaved
approximately EUR$1 billion euros from Volkswagen’s proﬁts, while DSM, a Dutch
chemicals group, warned that a 1% move in the EURUSD rate would reduce proﬁts
by EUR$7 million to EUR$11 million. Unfortunately, inadequate hedging is still a
reality in Europe, which makes monitoring the EURUSD exchange rate even more
important in forecasting the earnings and proﬁtability of European exporters.
■Nikkei and U.S. Dollar
Traders exposed to Japanese equities also need to be aware of the developments
that are occurring in the U.S. dollar and ho w that affects the Nikkei rally. Japan
recently came out of 10 years of stagnation. During this time, mutual funds and
hedge funds were grossly underweight Japanese equities. When the economy began
to turn around, global macro funds rushed to make changes to their portfolios in fear
of missing out on a great opportunity to take advantage of Japan’s recovery. Hedge
funds borrowed signiﬁcant amount of dollars to pay for increased exposure, but the
problem was that their borrowings were very sensitive to U.S. interest rates and the
Fed’s monetary policy tightening cycle. Increased borrowing costs forthe dollar could
derail the Nikkei’s rally because higher rates will raise the dollar’s ﬁnancing costs. Yet
with the huge current account deﬁcit, the Fed might need to continue raising rates
to increase the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Therefore, continual
FOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET3rate hikes, coupled with slowing growth in Japan, may make it less proﬁtable for
funds to be overleveraged and overly exposed to Japanese stocks. As a result, how
the U.S. dollar moves also plays a role on the future direction of the Nikkei.
■George Soros
Known as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England,’’ George Soros is one of
the most well-known traders in the FX market. We discuss his adventures in
more detail in Chapter 2, but in a nutshell, in 1990, England decided to join
the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) system because it wanted to take part in
the stable and low-inﬂation environment created by the Bundesbank, the central
bank of Germany. This alliance tied the pound to the deutschmark, which meant
that the United Kingdom was subject to the monetary policies enforced by the
Bundesbank. In the early 1990s, Germany aggressively increased interest rates to
avoid the inﬂationary effects related to German reuniﬁcation. However, national
pride and the commitment of ﬁxing exchange rates within the ERM prevented
England from devaluing the pound. On Wednesday, September 16, also known as
Black Wednesday, George Soros leveraged the entire value of his fund ($1 billion) and
sold $10 billion worth of pounds to bet against the ERM. This essentially ‘‘broke’’
the Bank of England and forced it to devalue the pound. In a matter of 24 hours, the
British pound fell approximately 5%, or 5000 pips. The Bank of England promised
to raise rates in order to tempt speculators to buy pounds. As a result, this caused
tremendous volatility in the bond markets, with 1-month UK LIBOR rates rising
1% and then retracing those gains over the next 24 hours. If bond traders were
completed oblivious to what was going on in the currency markets, they would have
probably found themselves dumbstruck in face of such rapid gyration in yields.
■Chinese Yuan Revaluation and Bonds
For Treasury traders, there’s another currency-related issue that is important to
follow and that is the gradual revaluation of the Chinese yuan. For most of its history,
the yuan or renminbi (RMB) was pegged to the U.S. dollar. In the 1980s, the RMB
was devalued to promote growth in C hina’s economy, and between 1997 and 2005
the People’s Bank of China artiﬁcially maintained a USDRMB rate of 8.27. At the
time, it received signiﬁcant criticism because keeping the peg meant that the Chinese
government would artiﬁcially weaken its currency to make Chinese goods more
competitive. To maintain the band, the Chinese government had to sell the yuan and
buy U.S. dollars each time their currency appreciated above the band’s upper limit.
These dollars were then used to purchase U.S. Treasuries, and this practice turned
FOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET4China into the world’s largest holder of U.S. Treasuries. In 2005, however, China
ended its dollar peg and linked the value of the yuan to a basket of currencies and
allowed it to ﬂuctuate within a narrow band that was reset every day. While the exact
percentage of the basket is unknown, it is largely dominated by the U.S. dollar and
includes other currencies such as the euro, Japanese yen, South Korean won, British
pound, Thai baht, Russian ruble, and Australian, Canadian, and Singapore dollar.
Through the years China has gradually widened the band that the yuan can trade
in, but if China were to end the ﬂoat and allow the RMB to trade freely on the
global foreign exchange market, the impact on the ﬁxed-income markets would be
signiﬁcant because it would reduce the government’s need to purchase Treasuries
and other ﬁxed-income securities. An announcement of this sort would send yields
soaring and prices tumbling. While it could be years before this happens, it will be
important for bond investors to follow these developments if they want to effectively
manage the risk.
■Comparing the FX Market with Futures
and Equities
The foreign exchange market has not always been a popular market to trade because
for many decades, it was restricted to hedge funds, commodity trading advisers who
manage large amounts of capital, major corporations, and institutional investors
due to regulation, capital requirements, and technology. Yet it was the market
of choice for many of these large players because the risk was fully customizable.
Trader A could use a 50 times leverage, and Trader B could trade cash on cash.
When the market opened up to retail traders, many brokerage ﬁrms swept in to
provide leveraged trading along with free instantaneous execution platforms, charts,
and real-time news. This access to low-cost information helped foreign exchange
trading surge in popularity, increasing its attractiveness as an alternative asset class
to trade.
Many equity and futures traders also turned to currencies, adding the asset class
to their trading portfolios. Before you choose to do so, however, it is important to
understand some of the key difference s between the forex and equity markets.
Characteristics of FX Markets
1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.
2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.
3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.
4. There are no trading curbs, and short selling is permitted without an uptick.
5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.
6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET5Characteristics of Equities Market
1. There is decent market liquidity, but that can depend on a stock’s daily volume.
2. The market is only available for trading 9:30am to 5pm NY Time, with limited
after-hours trading.
3. The existence of exchange fees results in higher costs and commissions.
4. There is an uptick rule to short stocks, which many day traders ﬁnd frustrating.
5. The number of steps involved in completing a trade can increase slippage and
error.
As one of the most liquid markets in the world, the volume and liquidity present in
the FX markets has allowed traders to access a 24-hour market with low transaction
costs, high leverage, the ability to proﬁt in both bull and bear markets, minimized
error rates, limited slippage, and no trading curbs or uptick rules. Oftentimes, traders
can use the same strategies for analyzing the equity markets in the FX market. Funda-
mental traders will ﬁnd that countries can be analyzed like stocks. Technical traders
will ﬁnd that the FX market is perfect for their style of analysis because of the abun-
dance of tick data and because it is already one of the most commonly used analysis
tools by professional traders. Now let’s take a closer look at the individual attributes
of the FX market to really understand why this is such an attractive market to trade!
24-Hour Market
One of the primary reasons why the FX market is popular is because for active
traders, it is the ideal market to trade. It’s 24-hour nature offers traders instant access
to the markets at all hours of the day for immediate response to global developments.
This characteristic also gives traders the added ﬂexibility of determining their own
trading day. Active day traders no longer have to wait for the equities market to
open at 9:30am NY Time to begin trading. If there is a signiﬁcant announcement or
development either domest ically or overseas bet ween 4pm NY Time and 9:30am
NY Time, most day traders will have to wait for the exchanges to open at 9:30am
to place trades. In all likelihood, by that time, unless you have access to electronic
communication networks (ECNs) such as Instinet for premarket trading, the market
would have gapped up or gapped down against your favor. This is particularly
frustrating when important data are released at 8:30am NY Time, such as nonfarm
payrolls. Professionals would have already priced in the outcome before the average
trader can even access to market.
In addition, many people who want to trade also have a full-time job during
the day. The ability to trade after hours makes the FX market a much more
convenient market for all traders. Different times of the day will offer different
trading opportunities, as the global ﬁnancial centers around the world are all actively
involved in foreign exchange. With the FX m arket, trading after hours with a large
online FX broker provides the same liquidity and spread as any other time of day.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET6As a guideline, at 5pm Sunday NY Time, trading begins as the markets open in
Sydney, Australia. Then, the Tokyo markets open at 7 pm NY Time. Next, Singapore
and Hong Kong open at 9pm NY Time followed by the European markets in Frankfurt
(2am) and then London (3am). By 4am the European markets are in full swing, and
Asia has concluded their trading day. The U.S. markets open ﬁrst in New York around
8am Monday as Europe winds down. By 5pm, Sydney is set to reopen once again.
The majority of trading activity happens when the markets overlap; for example,
Asia and Europe trading overlaps between 12am to approximately 2am, Europe and
the United States overlaps between 8a m to approximately 12pm NY Time, while
the United States and Asia overlap be tween 5pm and 9pm. During New York and
London hours, all currency pairs trade actively. During the Asian hours, however,
the trading activity for pairs such as the GBPJPY and AUDJPY tend to peak.
Lower Transaction Costs
Lower transaction costs also makes forex an attractive asset class to trade. In the
equity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission and with online
equity brokers, commissions can run upwards of $20 per trade. This means that for
positions of $100,000, average roundtrip commissions could be as high as $120.
The over the counter (OTC) structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and
clearing fees, which, in turn, lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced
by the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to
deal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.
Because the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight
competitive spreads day and night. Equity traders are more vulnerable to liquidity
risk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.
Low transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade for
short-term traders. For an active equity trader who typically places 30 trades a day,
at $20 commission per trade, you would have to up to pay $600 in daily transaction
costs. This is a signiﬁcant amount of money that could take a large cut out of proﬁts
or deepen losses. The reason why costs are so high is because there are a lot of
people involved in an equity transaction. More speciﬁcally, for each trade, there is
a broker, the exchange, and the specialist. All of these parties need to be paid, and
their payment comes in the form of commission and clearing fees. In the FX market,
because it is decentralized with no exchange or clearinghouse (everything is taken
care of by the market maker), these fees are not applicable.
Customizable Leverage
Even though many people realize that higher leverage comes with risks, traders are
humans, and few of them ﬁnd it easy to turn away the opportunity to trade on
FOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET7someone else’s money. The FX market caters perfectly to these traders by offering
the highest leverage available for any market. Most online currency ﬁrms offer 50
times leverage on regular-sized accounts and up to 200 times leverage on miniature
accounts (abroad leverage can be as high as 400 times). Compare that to the 2 times
leverage offered to the average equity investor and the 10 times capital that is
typically offered to the professional trader, and you can see why many traders have
turned to the foreign exchange market. The margin deposit for leverage in the FX
market is not seen as a down payment on a purchase of equity, as many perceive
margins to be in the stock markets. Rather, the margin is a performance bond, or
good-faith deposit, to ensure against trading losses. This is very useful to short-term
day traders who need the enhancement in capital to generate quick returns. For the
more risk-averse investor, leverage is completely customizable, which means that
if they only feel comfortable with 10 or 20 times leverage or no leverage at all,
they can elect to do so. It is extremely important to understand that leverage is a
double-edged sword—it can magnify proﬁts but also losses.
Proﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets
In the FX market, proﬁt potentials exist in both bull and bear markets. Since
currency trading always involves buying one currency and selling another, there
is no structural bias to the market. Therefore, if you are long one currency, you
are at the same time short another. As a result, equal proﬁt potential exists in
both upward-trending and downward-trending markets. This is different from the
equities market, where most traders go long instead of short stocks, so the general
equity investment community tends to suffer in a bear market.
No Trading Curbs or Uptick Rule
The FX market is the largest market in the world, forcing market makers to offer
very competitive prices. Unlike the equities market, there is never a time in the
FX markets when trading curbs would take into effect and trading would be halted,
only to gap when reopened. This eliminates missed proﬁts due to archaic exchange
regulations. In the FX market, traders would be able to place trades 24 hours a day
with virtually no disruptions.
One of the biggest annoyances for day trades in the equity market is the fact
that traders are prohibited from shorting a stock in a downtrend unless there is an
uptick. This can be very frustrating as traders wait to join short sellers, but are only
left with continually watching the stock trend down before an uptick occurs. In the
FX market, there is no such rule. If you want to short a currency pair, you can do
so immediately; this allows for instant and efﬁcient execution.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET8Online Trading Reducing Error Rates
A shorter trade process minimizes errors. Online currency trading is typically a
three-step process. A trader would place an order on the platform, the FX dealing
desk would automatically execute it electronically, and the order conﬁrmation
would be posted or logged onto the trader’s trading station. Typically, these three
steps would be completed in a matter of seconds. For an equities trade on the other
hand, there is generally a ﬁve-step process. The client would call his broker to place
an order, the broker sends the order to the exchange ﬂoor, the specialist on the
ﬂoor tries to match up orders (the broker competes with other brokers to get the
best ﬁll for the client), the specialist executes the trade, and the client receives a
conﬁrmation from the broker. The elimination of a middleman minimizes the error
rates in currency trades and increases the efﬁciency of each transaction.
Limited Slippage
Unlike the equity markets, many online FX market makers provide instantaneous
execution from real-time, two-way quotes. These quotes are the prices where the
ﬁrms are willing to buy or sell the quoted currency, rather than vague indications
of where the market is trading, which may or may not be honored. Orders are
executed and conﬁrmed within seconds. Robust systems would never request the
size of a trader’s potential order, or which side of the market he’s trading, before
giving him a bid/offer quote. Inefﬁcient dealers determine whether the investor is a
buyer or a seller, and shade the price to increase their own proﬁt on the transaction.
The equity market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’ system, under
which you may not get executed at the price you wish, but rather at the next best
price available. For example, let’s say Microsoft is trading at $52.50. If you enter a
buy order at this rate, by the time it reaches the specialist on the exchange ﬂoor, the
price may have risen to $53.25. In this case, you will not get executed at $52.50;
you will get executed at $53.25, which is essentially a loss of 3∕4of a point. The
price transparency provided by the some of the better market makers assures that
traders always receive a fair price.
Perfect Market for Technical Analysis
For technical analysts, currencies rarely spend much time in tight trading ranges and
have the tendency to develop strong trends. Over 80% of volume is speculative in
nature and as a result, the market frequently overshoots and then corrects itself.
Hence, technical analysis works well for the FX market, and a technically trained
trader can easily identify new trends and breakouts, which provide multiple oppor-
tunities to enter and exit positions. Charts and indicators are used by all professional
FX market traders, and candle charts are available on most charting packages. In addi-
tion, the most commonly used indicators such as Fibonacci retracements, stochastics,
FOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET9MACD, moving averages, RSI, and support/resistance levels have proven valid in
many instances.
In the USDJPY chart shown in Figure 1.1, it is clear that Fibonacci retracements,
moving averages, and stochastics have at one point or another given successful
trading signals. For example, the 61.8% retracement level served as resistance for
USDJPY in December 2014, January 2015, and February 2015. The moving-average
crossovers of the 10- and 20-day simple moving averages also successfully forecasted
the rally in USDJPY in late October, along with the decline in early January. Equity
traders who focus on technical analysis have the easiest transition, since they can
implement the same technical strategies that they use in the equities market into the
FX market.
Analyze Stocks Like Countries
Trading currencies is not a big challenge for fundamental traders either, because
countries can be analyzed like stocks. For example, if you analyze growth rates of
stocks, you can use gross domestic product (GDP) to analyze the growth rate of
countries. If you analyze inventory and production ratios, you can follow industrial
production (IP) or durable goods data. If you follow sales ﬁgures, you can analyze

country that is growing faster and fund it with a currency of a country that is growing
slower. Currency prices reﬂect the balance of supply and demand for currencies.
Two of the primary factors affecting supply and demand of currencies are interest
rates and the overall strength of the economy. Economic indicators such as GDP,
foreign investment, and the trade balance reﬂect the general health of an economy
and are therefore responsible for the underlying shifts in supply and demand for
that currency. There is a tremendous amount of data released at regular intervals,
some of which are more important than others. Data related to interest rates and
international trade is the most closely followed.
If there is uncertainty regarding the direction of interest rates, any bit of news
on monetary policy can directly affect how the currency trades. Traditionally,
if a country raises its interest rate, the currency of that country will strengthen
in relation to other countries as investors shift assets to that country to gain a
higher return. In contrast, an interest rates hike is generally bad news for stocks
because it means that borrowing costs have risen. In response, some investors will
transfer money out of a country’s stock market when interest rates are increased,
causing the country’s currency to weaken. Determining which effect dominates can
be tricky, but generally there is an advance consensus on how interest rates will
move. Indicators that have the biggest impact on interest rates are producer prices,
consumer prices, employment, spending, and GDP. Most of the time monetary
policy announcements are known in advance with meeting dates by the Bank of

of Japan (BoJ), and other central banks posted on their respective websites.
Another piece of data that can impact how currencies move is the trade balance,
which shows the net differ ence over a period of time b etween a nation’s exports and
imports. When a country imports more than it exports, the trade balance will show
a deﬁcit, which is generally considered unfavorable. For example, if U.S. dollars are
sold for other domestic national currencies (to pay for imports), the ﬂow of dollars
outside the country will depreciate the value of the dollar. Similarly, if trade ﬁgures
show an increase in exports, dollars will ﬂow into the United States and appreciate
the value of the dollar. From the standpoint of a national economy, a deﬁcit in and of
itself is not necessarily a bad thing. If the deﬁcit is greater than market expectations
however, it can trigger a negative price movement.
■FX versus Futures
Trading spot forex is also different from trading futures, and like equity traders,
many futures traders have also added currency spot trading into their portfolios. We
know that the spot forex market has the following attributes:
Characteristics of FX Markets
1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.
2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.
3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.
4. There are no trading curbs and short selling is permitted without an uptick.
5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.
6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.
Characteristics of Futures Markets
1. There is limited market liquidity depending on the month of contract trades.
2. The presence of exchange fees results in more costs and commissions.
3. Market hours for futures trading are much shorter than spot and are dependent
on the product traded; each product may have different open and closing hours,
and there is limited after-hours trading.
4. Futures leverage is higher than equities, but still only a fraction of the leverage
offered in FX.
5. There tends to be prolonged bear markets.
6. Pit trading structure increases error and slippage.
Like in the equities market, traders can implement the same strategies they use
in analyzing the futures markets in the FX m arket. Most future tr aders are technical
traders, and the FX market is perfect for technical analysis. In fact, it is the most
popular analysis technique used by professional FX traders. Taking a closer look at
how the futures market stacks up, we see the following.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET12Comparing Market Hours and Liquidity
The volume traded in the FX market is estimated to be over ﬁve times that of the
futures market. The FX market is open for trading 24 hours a day, but the futures
market has confusing market hours which vary based on the product traded. For
example, if you traded gold futures, it is only open for trading between 7:20am
and 1:30pm on the COMEX. If you traded crude oil futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, t rading would only be ope n between 8:30am. and 2:10pm.
These varying hours not only create confusion but also makes it difﬁcult to act on
breakthrough announcements throughout the reminder of the day.
In addition, if you have a day job and can only trade after hours, futures would be
a very inconvenient market product to trade. You would basically be placing orders
based on past prices that are not current market prices. This lack of transparency
makes trading very cumbersome. In addition, each time zone has its own unique
news and developments that could move speciﬁc currency pairs, and with futures it
can difﬁcult to act on breaking overnight news.
Low to Zero Transaction Costs
In the equity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission. With future
brokers, average commissions can run close to $160 per trade on positions of
$100,000 or greater. The OTC structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and
clearing fees, which can in turn lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced
by the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to
deal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.
Because the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight,
competitive spreads day and night. Futures traders are more vulnerable to liquidity
risk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.
Low to zero transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade
for short-term traders. If you are an active futures trader who typically places 20
trades a day, at $100 commission per trade, you would have to pay $2,000 in daily
transaction costs. A typical futures trade involves a broker, a future commissions
merchant (FCM) order desk, a clerk on the exchange ﬂoor, a runner, and a pit
trader. All of these parties need to be paid, and their payment comes in the form of
commission and clearing fees, whereas the electronic nature of the market minimizes
these costs.
No Limit Up or Down Rules/Proﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets
Unlike the tight restriction on the futures market, there is no limit down or limit
up rule in the FX market. For example, on the S&P index futures, if the contract
value falls more than 5% from the previous day’s close, limit down rules will come
FOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET13in effect, whereby on a 5% move, the index would only be allowed to trade at
or above this level for the next 10 minutes. For a 20% decline, trading would be
completely halted. Due to the decentralized nature of the FX market, there are no
exchange-enforced restrictions on daily activity, which can help eliminate missed
opportunities caused by archaic exchange regulations.
Execution Quality and Speed/Low Error Rates
The futures market is also known for inconsistent execution, both in terms of pricing
and execution time. Every futures trader has, at some point in time, experienced
a half hour or so wait for a market order to be ﬁlled, only to ﬁnd that the order
has been executed at a price far away from where the market was trading when
the initial order was placed. Even with electronic trading and limited guarantees of
execution speed, the price for ﬁlls on market orders is far from certain. The reason
for this inefﬁciency is the number of steps that are involved in placing a futures
trade. A futures trade is typically a seven-step process:
1. The client calls his broker and places his trade (or places it online).
2. The trading desk receives the order, processes it, and routes it to the FCM
order desk on the exchange ﬂoor.
3. The FCM order desk passes the order to the order clerk.
4. The order clerk hands the order to a runner or signals it to the pit.
5. The trading clerk goes to the pit to execute the trade.
6. The trade conﬁrmation goes to the runner or is signaled to the order clerk and
processed by the FCM order desk.
7. The broker receives the trade conﬁrmation and passes it on to the client.
An FX trade in comparison is typically only a three-step process. A trader would
place an order on the platform, the FX dealing desk would automatically execute
it electronically, and the order conﬁrmation would be posted or logged on the
trader’s trading station. The elimination of the involvement of these additional
parties increases the speed of the trade execution and decreases errors.
In addition, the futures market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’
system, under which your trades frequently do not get executed at the initial market
order price, but rather, at the next best price available. For example, let’s say a
client is long 5 March Dow Jones futures contracts at 8800. If the client enters a
stop order at 8700, when the rate reaches this level, the client will most likely be
executed at 8690. This 10-point difference would be attributed to slippage, which
is very common in the futures market.
On most FX trading stations, traders execute directly off of real-time streaming
prices. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, there is generally no discrepancy
between the displayed price and the execution price. This holds true even during
FOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET14volatile times and fast-moving markets. In the futures market, execution is uncertain
because all orders must be done on the exchange. This creates a situation where
liquidity is limited by the number of participants, which, in turn, limits quantities
that can be traded at a given price. Real-time streaming prices ensure that market
orders, stops, and limits are executed with minimal slippage and no partial ﬁlls.
■W h oA r et h eP l a y e r si nt h eF XM a r k e t ?
Since the foreign exchange market is an OTC market without a centralized exchange,
competition between market makers prohibits monopolisti c pricing strategies. If
one market maker attempts to drastically skew the price, then traders simply have
the option to ﬁnd another market maker. Moreover, spreads are closely watched to
ensure market makers are not whimsically altering the cost of the trade. Many equity
markets, on the other hand, operate in a completely different fashion; the New York
Stock Exchange, for instance, is the sole place where companies listed on the NYSE
can have their stocks traded. Centralized markets are operated by what are referred
to as specialists. Market makers, on the other hand, is the term used in reference to
decentralized marketplaces. Since the NYSE is a centralized market, a stock traded
on the NYSE can only have one bid–ask quote at all times. Decentralized markets,
such as foreign exchange, can have multiple market makers—all of whom have the
right to quote different prices. Here is an illustration of how both centralized and
decentralized markets operate.
Centralized Markets
By their very nature, centralized markets tend to be monopolistic: With a single
specialist controlling th e market, prices can easil y be skewed to a ccommodate the
interests of the specialist, not those of the traders (see Figure 1.2). If, for example,
the market is ﬁlled with sellers that the specialists must buy from but no prospective
buyers on the other side, the specialist may simply widen the spread, thereby

the market. Or, specialists can drastically alter the quotes they are offering, thus
manipulating the price to accommodate their own risk tolerance.
Hierarchy of Participants
While the foreign exchange market is decentralized, and hence employs multiple
market makers rather than a single specialist, participants in the FX market are
organized into a hierarchy; those with superior credit access, volume transacted,
and sophistication receive priority pricing in the market (see Figure 1.3). At the
top of the food chain is the interbank market, which trades the highest volume per
day in relatively few currencies. In the interbank market, the largest banks can deal
with each other directly, via interbank brokers, or through electronic brokering
systems like EBS or Reuters. The interbank market is a credit-approved system,
where banks trade based solely on the credit relationships they have established
with one another. The banks can see the rates everyone is dealing at, but each bank
must have a speciﬁc credit relationship with that bank in order to trade at the rates
being offered. Other institutions such as online FX market makers, hedge funds,
and corporations must trade FX through these banks, although some have created
their own liquidity pools through the years. Many banks (e.g., small community
banks or banks in emerging markets), corporations, and institutional investors do
not have access to these rates because they have no established credit lines with
big banks. This forces smaller participants to deal through just one bank for their

the participants further down the participant hierarchy. Those receiving the least
competitive rates are customers of banks and physical currency exchange companies.
Recently, technology has broken down the barriers that used to stand between the
end-users of foreign exchange services and the interbank market. The online trading
revolution opened its doors to retail clientele by connecting market makers and
market participants in an efﬁcient, low-cost manner. In essence, online trading
platforms serve as a gateway to the liquid FX market. Average traders can now
trade alongside the biggest banks in the world, with virtually similar pricing and
execution. What used to be a game dominated and controlled by the ‘‘big boys’’ is
slowly becoming a level playing ﬁeld where individuals can proﬁt and take advantage
of the same opportunities as big banks. FX is no longer an old boys club, which
means opportunities abound for aspiring online currency traders.
Dealing Stations— Interbank Market
For serious traders who want to know more about the interbank market, the
majority of FX volume is actually transacted primarily through the interbank
market. The leading banks of the world trade with each other electronically
over two platforms—the EBS and Reuters, dealing 3000-spot matching. Both
platforms offer trading in the major currency pairs; however, certain currency
pairs are more liquid and generally more frequently traded over one versus the
other. Some cross-currency pairs are traded over these platforms as well, but
others are calculated from the rates of the major currency pairs and are then offset
using the ‘‘legs.’’ For example, if an interbank trader had a client who wanted to
go long NZDCAD, the trader would most likely buy NZDUSD and USDCAD
separately. The trader would then multiply these rates and provide the client with
the respective NZDCAD rate, creating a synthetic quote and trade.
17CHAPTER 2
Historical Events in
the FX Markets
Before learning how to trade currencies, it is important for every new and
seasoned market participant to have some understanding about the most
important historical events that have shaped the currency market. To this day, these
events are often referenced by professional traders.
■Bretton Woods: Anointing the Dollar as the World
Currency (1944)
In July 1944, representatives of 44 nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire,
to create a new institutional arrangement for governing the international economy
in the years following World War II. Most agreed that international economic
instability was one of the principle causes of the war, and that such instability needed
to be prevented in the future. The agreement, which was developed by renowned
economists John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White, was initially proposed
to Great Britain as a part of the Lend Lease Act—an American act designed to assist
Great Britain in postwar redevelopment efforts. After various negotiations, the ﬁnal
form of the Bretton Woods Agreement consisted of three key items:
1. The formation of key international authorities designed to promote fair trade
and international economic harmony
2. The ﬁxation of exchange rates between currencies
3. The convertibility between gold and t he U.S. dollar, thus empowering the U.S.
dollar as the reserve currency of choice for the world
HISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS18Of these three parameters, only the ﬁrst is still in existence today, but the
organizations formed as a direct result of Bretton Woods include the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT); and they all play a crucial role in modern day development and regulation
of international economies. Since the demise of Bretton Woods, the IMF has
worked closely with the World Bank. Toge ther, the two institutions now regularly
lend funds to developing nations, assisting them in the development of a public
infrastructure capable of supporting a sound mercantile economy that can contribute
in the international arena. In order to ensure that these nations can actually enjoy
equal and legitimate access to trade with their industrialized counterparts, the World
Bank and IMF must work closely with GATT. While GATT was initially meant to
be a temporary organization, it now operates to encourage the dismantling of trade
barriers—namely, tariffs and quotas.
The Bretton Woods Agreement existed from 1944 to 1971, after which it
was replaced by the Smithsonian Agreement, an international contract pioneered
by U.S. President Richard Nixon out the necessity to accommodate for Bretton
Woods’ shortcomings. Unfortunately, the Smithsonian Agreement possessed the
same critical weakness: While it did not include gold/U.S. dollar convertibility,
it maintained ﬁxed exchange rates—a facet that did not accommodate the United
States’ ongoing trade deﬁcit and the international need for a weaker U.S. dollar. As
a result, the Smithsonian Agreement was short-lived.
Ultimately, the exchange rates of t he world evolved into a free market,
where supply and demand were the sole criteria that determined the value of a
currency. While this did and still does result in a number of currency crises and
greater volatility between currencies, it also allowed the market to become self-
regulating, and thus could dictate the appropriate value of a currency without any
hindrances.
As for Bretton Woods, perhaps its most memorable contribution to the interna-
tional economic arena was its role in changing the international perception about the
U.S. dollar. While the euro is a revolutionary currency blazing new frontiers in both
social behavior and international trade, the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve
currency of choice. This is due, in large part, to the Bretton Woods Agreement:
By establishing dollar/gold convertibility, the dollar’s role as the world’s most
accessible and reliable currency was ﬁrmly cemented. So while Bretton Woods
might be a doctrine of yesteryear, its impact on the U.S. dollar and international
economics still resonates today.
■The End of Bretton Woods: Free Market
Capitalism Is Born (1971)
On August 15, 1971, it became ofﬁcial: The Bretton-Woods system was abandoned
once and for all. While it had been exorcised before—only to subsequently emerge
HISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS19in a new form—this ﬁnal eradication of the Bretton Woods system was truly its
last stand: No longer would currencies be ﬁxed in value to gold, allowed only to
ﬂuctuate in a 1% range, but instead, their fair valuation could be determined by
free-market behavior such as trade ﬂows and foreign direct investment.
Although U.S. President Nixon was conﬁdent that the end of the Bretton Woods
system would bring about better times for the international economy, he was
not a believer that the free market could dictate a currency’s true valuation in a
fair and catastrophe-free manner. Nixon and many well-respected economists at
the time reasoned that an entirely unstructured foreign exchange market would
result in competing devaluations, which, in turn, would lead to the breakdown of
international trade and investment. The end result, Nixon and his board of economic
advisors argued, would be global depression.
In response, the Smithsonian Agreement was introduced a few months later.
Hailed by President Nixon as the ‘‘greatest monetary agreement in the history of
the world,’’ the Smithsonian Agreement strived to maintain ﬁxed exchange rates
without the backing of gold. Its key difference from the Bretton Woods system was
that the value of the dollar could ﬂoat in a range of 2.25%, compared to just 1%
under Bretton Woods.
Ultimately, the Smithsonian Agreement proved to be unfeasible as well. Without
exchange rates ﬁxed to gold, the free market gold price shot up to $215 per
ounce. Moreover, the U.S. trade deﬁcit continued to grow, and from a fundamental
standpoint, the U.S. dollar needed to be devalued beyond the 2.25% parameters
established by the Smithsonian Agreement. In light of these problems, the foreign
exchange markets were forced to close in February 1972.
The markets reopened in March 1973, and this time, they were not bound by a
Smithsonian Agreement: The value of the US dollar was to be determined entirely
by the market, as its value was not ﬁxed to any commodity, nor was its exchange rate
ﬂuctuation conﬁned to certain parameters. While this did provide the U.S. dollar,
and other currencies by default, the agility required to adapt to a new and rapidly
evolving international trading environment, it also set the stage for unprecedented
inﬂation. The end of Bretton Woods and the Smithsonian Agreement, as well as
conﬂicts in the Middle East, resulted in substantially higher oil prices and helped
to create stagﬂation—the synthesis of unemployment and inﬂation—in the U.S.
economy. It would not be until later in the decade, when Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker initiated new economic policies and President Reagan introduced a new
ﬁscal agenda, that the U.S. dollar would return to ‘‘normal’’ valuations. By then,
the foreign exchange markets had thoroughly developed and were capable of serving
a multitude of purposes. In addition to employing a laissez-faire style of regulation
on international trade, they also were beginning to attract speculators seeking to
participate in a market with unrivaled liquidity and continued growth. Ultimately,
the death of Bretton Woods in 1971 marked the beginning of a new economic era, one
that liberated international trading while also proliferating speculative opportunities.
HISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS20■Plaza Accord—Devaluation
of the U.S. Dollar (1985)
After the demise of all the various exchange rate regulatory mechanisms that
characterized the twentieth century—t hat is, the Gold Standard, the Bretton
Woods Standard, and the Smithsonian Agreement—the currency market was left
with virtually no regulation other than the mythical ‘‘invisible hand’’ of free
market capitalism, one that supposedly strived to create economic balance through
supply and demand. Unfortunately, due to a number of unforeseen economic
events—such as the OPEC oil crises, stagﬂation throughout the 1970s, and drastic
changes in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ﬁscal policy—supply and demand, in and
of themselves, became insufﬁcient means by which the currency markets could be
regulated. A system of sorts was needed, but not one that was inﬂexible: Fixation of
currency values to a commodity, such as gold, proved to be too rigid for economic
development, as was also the notion of ﬁxing maximum exchange rate ﬂuctuations.
The balance between structure and rigidity was one that had plagued the currency
markets throughout the twentieth century, and while advancements had been made,
a deﬁnitive solution was still greatly needed.
Hence, in 1985, the respective ministers of ﬁnance and central bank governors
of the world’s leading economies—France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom,
and the United States—convened in New York City, with the hopes of arranging a
diplomatic agreement that would work to optimize the economic effectiveness of
the foreign exchange markets. Meeting at the Plaza Hotel, the international leaders
came to the following agreements regarding speciﬁc economies and the international
economy as a whole:
■Across the world, inﬂation was at very low levels. Contrary to the stagﬂation of
the 1970s—where inﬂation was high and real economic growth was low—the
global economy in 1985 had done a complete 180, as inﬂation was now low and
growth was strong.
■While low inﬂation, even when coupled with robust economic growth, still
allowed for low interest rates—a caveat that developing countries particularly
enjoyed—there was an imminent danger of protectionist policies such as tariffs
entering the economy. The United States was experiencing a large and growing
current account deﬁcit, while Japan and Germany were facing large and growing
surpluses. An imbalance so fundamental in nature could create serious economic
disequilibrium, which, in turn, would result in a distortion of the foreign exchange
markets, and thus, the international economy as a whole.
■The results of current account imbalances, and the protectionist policies that
ensued, required action. Ultimately, it was believed that the rapid acceleration
in the value of the U.S. dollar, which appreciated more than 80% against the
HISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS21currencies of its major trading partners, was the primary culprit. The rising
value of the U.S. dollar created enormous trade deﬁcits, hurting many different
economies.
At the meeting in the Plaza Hotel, the Uni ted States persuad ed other attending
countries to coordinate a multilateral intervention, and on September 22, 1985,
the Plaza Accord was implemented. This agreement was designed to allow for
a controlled decline of the dollar and the appreciation of the main anti-dollar
currencies. Each country agreed to changes to their economic policies and to
intervene in currency markets as necessary to weaken the value of the dollar. The
United States agreed to cut its budget deﬁcit and lower interest rates. France, the
United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan agreed to raise interest rates. Germany also
agreed to tax cuts, while Japan agreed to let the value of the yen ‘‘fully reﬂect
the underlying strength of the Japanese economy.’’ However, one major problem
was that not every country adhered to their pledges made under the Plaza Accord.
The United States, in particular, did not follow through with its initial promise to
cut the budget deﬁcit. Japan was severely hurt by the sharp rise in the yen, as its
exporters were unable to remain competitive overseas, and it is argued that this
eventually triggered a 10-year recession in Japan. The United S tates, on the other
hand, enjoyed considerable growth and price stability as a result of the agreement.
The effects of the multilateral intervention were seen immediately, and within
less than two years, the dollar fell 46% and 50% against the German deutschemark
and the Japanese yen, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.1. The U.S. economy

Germany and Japan assumed the role of major net importers. This gradually resolved
the current account deﬁcits for the time being, and also ensured that protectionist
policies were minimal and nonthreatening. But perhaps most importantly, the
Plaza Accord cemented the role of the central banks in regulating exchange rate
movement—yes, the rates would not be ﬁxed, and hence would be determined
primarily by supply and demand; but ultimately, such an invisible hand is insufﬁcient,
and it was the right and responsibility of the world’s central banks to intervene on
behalf of the international economy when necessary.
■George Soros—The Man Who Broke the Bank
of England
When George Soros placed a $10 billion speculative bet on the UK pound and
won, he became universally known as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England.’’
Whether you love him or hate him, Soros led the charge in one of the most
fascinating events in currency trading history. Here are the details.
The UK Joins the Exchange Rate Mechanism
In 1979, a Franco-German initiative set up the European Monetary System (EMS) to
stabilize exchange rates, reduce inﬂation, and prepare for monetary integration. The
Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), one of the EMS’s main components, gave each
participatory currency a central exchange rate against a basket of currencies, the
European Currency Unit (ECU). Participants (initially France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and Luxemburg) were then required to
maintain their exchange rates within a 2.25% ﬂuctuation band above or below each
bilateral central rate. The ERM was an adjustable-peg system, and nine realignments
would occur between 1979 and 1987. Whil e the United Kingdom was not one of
the original members, it would eventually join in 1990 at a rate of DM2.95 to the
pound and with a ﬂuctuation band of +/–6%.
Until mid-1992, the ERM appeared to be a success, as a disciplinary effect
had reduced inﬂation throughout Europe under the leadership of the German
Bundesbank. The stability wouldn’t last, however, as international investors started
worrying that the exchange rate values of several currencies within the ERM
were inappropriate. Following German reuniﬁcation in 1989 government spending
surged, forcing the Bundesbank to print more money. This led to high inﬂation
and left the German central bank with little choice but to increase interest rates.
However, the rate hike came with consequences as it placed upward pressure on
the German mark. This forced other central banks to raise their interest rates as
HISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS23well as to maintain their pegged currency exchange rates (a direct application of
Irving Fischer’s interest parity theory). Realizing that the UK’s weak economy and
high unemployment rate would not permit the British government to maintain this
policy for long, George Soros stepped into action.
Soros Bets Against the Success of UK Involvement in the ERM
The quantum hedge fund manager essentially wanted to bet that the pound would
depreciate because the United Kingdom would either devalue the pound or leave the
ERM. Thanks to the progressive removal of capital controls during the EMS years,
international investors at the time had more freedom than ever to take advantage
of perceived disequilibria, so Soros established short positions in pounds and long
positions in marks by borrowing pounds and investing in mark-denominated assets.
He also made great use of options and futures. In all, his positions accounted for
a gargantuan $10 billion. Soros was not the only one; many other investors soon
followed suit. Everyone was selling pounds, placing tremendous downward pressure
on the currency.
At ﬁrst, the Bank of England (BoE) tried to defend the pegged rates by buying
15 billion pounds with its large reserve assets, but its sterilized interventions
(whereby the monetary base is held constant thanks to open market interventions)
were limited in their effectiveness. The pound was trading dangerously close to the
lower levels of its ﬁxed band. On September 16, 1992, a day that would later be
known as Black Wednesday, the bank announced a 2% rise in interest rates (from
10% to 12%) in an attempt to boost the pound’s appeal. A few hours later, it
promised to raise rates again to 15%, but international investors such as Soros could
not be swayed, knowing that huge proﬁts were right around the corner. Traders
kept selling pounds in huge volumes, and the BoE kept buying them until, ﬁnally, at
7:00 pm that same day, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced that Britain would
leave the ERM and that rates would return to their initial level of 10%. The chaotic
Black Wednesday marked the beginning of a steep depreciation in the pound’s
effective value.
Whether the return to a ﬂoating currency was due to the Soros-led attack on
the pound or because of simple fundamental analysis is still debated today. What
is certain, however, is that the pound’s depreciation of almost 15% against the
deutschemark and 25% against the dollar over the next ﬁve weeks as seen in Figure 2.2
and Figure 2.3 resulted in tremendous proﬁts for Soros and others traders (the pound
also weakened by a similar proportion to the dollar). Within a month, the quantum
fund cashed in on approximately $2 billion by selling the now more expensive
DMs and buying back the now cheaper pounds. ‘‘The man who broke the Bank of
England’’ showed how central banks can still be vulnerable to speculative attacks.

HISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS25■Asian Financial Crisis (1997–1998)
Falling like a set of dominos on July 2, 1997, the relatively nascent Asian tiger
economies provide the perfect example of the interdependence in global capital
markets and their subsequent effects throughout international currency forums.
Based on several fundamental breakdowns, the cause of the ‘‘contagion’’ stemmed
largely from shrouded lending practices, inﬂated trade deﬁcits, and immature capital
markets. Compiled, these factors contributed to a perfect storm that left major
regional markets incapacitated and once-prized currencies devalued to signiﬁcantly
lower levels. With adverse effects easily seen in the equities markets, currency
market ﬂuctuations were negatively impacted in much the same manner during this
time period.
The Bubble
Leading up to 1997, investors had become increasingly attracted to Asian investment
prospects, focusing on real estate development and domestic equities. As a result,
foreign investment capital ﬂowed into the region as economic growth rates climbed
on improved production in countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and
Korea. Thailand, home of the baht, experienced a 6.5% growth rate in 1996, falling
from 13% in 1988. Lending additional support for a stronger economy was the
enactment of a ﬁxed currency peg to the U.S. dollar. With a ﬁxed valuation to
the greenback, countries like Thailand could ensure ﬁnancial stability in their own
markets and a constant rate for export trading purposes with the world’s largest
economy. Ultimately, the region’s national currencies appreciated, as underlying
fundamentals were justiﬁed and increased speculative positions of further climbs in
price mounted.
Ballooning Current Account Deﬁcits and Nonperforming Loans
However, in early 1997, a shift in sentiment began to occur as international account
deﬁcits became increasingly difﬁcult for respective governments to handle and
lending practices were revealed to be detrimental to the economic infrastructure. In
particular, economists were alerted to the fact that Thailand’s current account deﬁcit
ballooned in 1996 to $14.7 billion and had been climbing since 1992. Although
comparatively smaller than the U.S. deﬁcit, the gap represented 8% of the country’s
gross domestic product. Shrouded lending practices also contributed heavily to
these breakdowns, as close personal relationships with high-ranking banking ofﬁcials
were well rewarded and surprisingly common throughout the region. In particular
this affected many of South Korea’s highly leveraged conglomerates as total
nonperforming loan values skyrocketed to 7.5 percent of gross domestic product.
Additional evidence of these practices could be observed in ﬁnancial institutions
HISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS26throughout Japan. First announcing questionable and nonperforming loans of
$136 billion in 1994, Japanese authorities admitted to an alarming $400 billion
total a year later. Coupled with a then-crippled stock market, cooling real estate
values, and dramatic slowdowns in the economy, investors saw opportunity in
a depreciating yen, subsequently adding selling pressure to neighbor currencies.
When their own asset bubble collapsed, asset prices fell by $10 trillion, with
the fall in real estate prices accounting for nearly 65% of the total decline—the
losses were worth two years of national output. This fall in asset prices sparked
the banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early 1990s and then developed into a
full-blown, systemic crisis in 1997, following the failure of a number of high-proﬁle
ﬁnancial institutions. In response, Japanese monetary authorities issued rhetoric on
potentially increasing benchmark interest rates in hopes of defending the domestic
currency valuation. Unfortunately, these considerations never materialized and a
shortfall ensued. Sparked mainly by an announcement of a managed ﬂoat of the Thai
baht, the slide snowballed as central bank reserves evaporated and currency price
levels became unsustainable in light of downside selling pressure.
Currency Crisis
Following mass short speculation and attempted intervention, the aforementioned
Asian economies were left ruined and momentarily incapacitated. The Thailand baht,
a once-prized possession, was devalued by as much as 48 percent, even slumping
closer to a 100% fall at the turn of the new year. The most adversely affected was

from its high to low against the U.S. do llar between 1997 and 1998, and after having
retraced a signiﬁcant portion of its losses, ended the 8-month debacle down 15%,

Lasting for less than a year, the ﬁnancial crisis of 1997 revealed the interconnec-
tivity of economies and their effects in the global currency markets. Additionally, it
showed the inability of central banks to successfully intervene in currency valuations
with the absence of secure economic fundamentals and overwhelming market forces.
Today, with the assistance of IMF reparation packages and the implementation of
stricter requirements, Asia’s four little dragons are healthy once again. With inﬂa-
tionary benchmarks and a revived exporting market, Southeast Asia is building back
its once prominent stature among the world’s industrialized economic regions. With
the experience of evaporating currency reserves under their belt, the Asian tigers
now take active initiatives to ensure that there is large pot of reserves on hand in
case speculators attempt to attack their currencies once again.
■Introduction of the Euro (1999)
The introduction of the euro was a monumental achievement, marking the largest
monetary changeover ever. The euro was ofﬁcially launched as an electronic trading
HISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS28currency on January 1, 1999. Euro notes and coins were put into circulation in 2002.
The 11 initial member states were: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, and Finland. As of 2015, there
are 17 countries in the Eurozone. Each country ﬁxed its currency to a speciﬁc
conversion rate against the euro, and a common monetary policy governed by the
European Central Bank (ECB) was adopted. To many economists, the system would
ideally include all of the original 15 EU nations, but the United Kingdom, Sweden,
and Denmark decided to keep their own currencies. In deciding whether to adopt
the euro, EU members have many important factors to consider.
The 1993 Maastricht Treaty sets out ﬁve main convergence criteria for member
states to participate in the European Monetary Union (EMU):
Maastricht Treaty: C onvergence Criteria
■The country’s government budget deﬁcit could not be greater than 3% of GDP.
■The country’s government debt could not be larger than 60% of GDP.
■The country’s exchange rate had to be maintained within ERM bands without any
realignment for two years prior to joining.
■The country’s inﬂation rate could not be higher than 1.5% above the average
inﬂation rate of the three EU countries with the lowest inﬂation rates.
■The country’s long-term interest rate on government bonds could not be higher
than 2% above the average of the comparable rates in the three countries with the
lowest inﬂation.
Although the ease of traveling is one of the most attractive reasons to join the
euro, being part of the monetary union provides other beneﬁts:
■It eliminates exchange rate ﬂuctuations, providing a more stable environment to
trade within the euro area.
■The purging of all exchange rate risk within the zone allows businesses to plan
investment decisions with greater certainty.
■Transaction costs also diminish, mainly those relating to foreign exchange
operations, hedging operations, cross-border payments, and the management of
several currency accounts.
■Prices become more transparent as consumers and businesses can compare prices
across countries more easily, which, in turn, increases competition.
■A huge single currency market becomes more attractive for foreign investors.
■The economy’s magnitude and stability allow the ECB to control inﬂation with
lower interest rates, thanks to increased credibility.

HISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS30Yet the euro is not without its limitations. Leaving aside political sovereignty
issues, the main problem is that, by adopting the euro, a nation essentially forfeits
any independent monetary policy. Since each country’s economy is not perfectly
correlated to the EMU’s economy, a nation might ﬁnd the ECB hiking interest
rates during a domestic recession. This can be particularly true for many of the
smaller nations. As a result, countries try to rely more heavily on ﬁscal policy, but
the efﬁciency of ﬁscal policy is limited when it is not effectively combined with
monetary policy. This inefﬁciency is further exacerbated by the 3% of GDP limit on
budget deﬁcits, as stipulated by the Stability and Growth Pact.
Some concerns also subsist regarding the ECB’s effectiveness as a central bank.
The central bank strives for a 2% inﬂation target, but in the past 15 years, it strayed
away from this level often. Also, from 1999 to late 2002, a lack of conﬁdence
in the union’s currency (and in the union itself) led to a 24% depreciation, from
approximately $1.15 to the euro in January 1999 to $0.88 in May 2000, forcing
the ECB to intervene in foreign exchange markets in the last few months of 2000.
Figure 2.6 shows a daily chart of the euro since it was launched in 1999.
Since 2000, things have greatly changed, with the euro trading at a premium to
the dollar, but quantitative easing in 2014 put the currency back in a downtrend
versus the dollar. Some analysts claim that the euro will one day replace the dollar
as the world’s dominant international currency, and while we believe it will have a
greater share in reserve portfolios, we doubt that this will be likely.
31CHAPTER 3
What Moves the
Currency Market?
Now that we know a little bit about the history of the forex market, let’s take a
look at what moves currencies. There are two primary ways to analyze ﬁnancial
markets: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis is rooted
in understanding underlying economic conditions, while technical analysis uses
historical prices to predict future movements. For as long as technical analysis
has been around, there has been an ongoing debate as to which methodology
is more successful. Short-term traders prefer to use technical analysis, focusing
their strategies primarily on price action, while medium-term traders tend to use
fundamental analysis to determine a currency’s current and future valuation.
Before implementing successful trading strategies, it is important to understand
what drives the movements of currencies in the foreign exchange market. The
best strategies tend to be the ones that combine both fundamental and technical
analysis. Textbook perfect technical formations have failed too often because of
major fundamental news and events like U.S. nonfarm payrolls. But trading on
fundamentals alone can also be risky. There will oftentimes be sharp gyrations in
the price of currency on a day when there are no news or economic reports. This
suggests that the price action is driven by nothing more than ﬂows, sentiment, and
pattern formations. Therefore, it is very important for technical traders to be aware
of the key economic data or events that are scheduled for release, and, in turn,
for fundamental traders to be aware of important technical levels that the general
market may be focusing on.
WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?32■Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental analysis focuses on the economic, social, and political forces that drive
supply and demand. Those using fundamental analysis as a trading tool look at
various macroeconomic indicators such as growth rates, interest rates, inﬂation,
and unemployment. We outlined some of the most important economic releases
in the ﬁrst chapter of this book. Fundamental analysts will combine all of this
information to assess current and future performance. This requires a lot of work
and thorough analysis, as there is no single set of beliefs that guides fundamental
analysis. Traders employing fundamental analysis need to continually keep abreast
of news and announcements, as they can indicate potential changes to the economic,
social, and political environment. All traders should be aware of the broad economic
conditions before placing trades. This is especially important for day traders who
are trying to make trading decisions based on news events because even though
Federal Reserve Monetary Policy decisions are always important, if the rate move is
completely priced into the market, then the actual reaction in the EURUSD could
be nominal.
Taking a step back, currencies move primarily based on supply and demand.
That is, on the most fundamental level, a currency rallies because there is demand
for that currency. Regardless of whether the demand is for hedging, speculative,
or conversion purposes, true movements are based on the need for the currency.
Currency values decrease when there is excess supply. Supply and demand should be
the real determinants for predicting future movements. However, how to predict
supply and demand is not as simple as many would think. There are many factors
that contribute to the net supply and demand for a currency. This includes capital
ﬂows, trade ﬂows, speculative, and hedging needs.
For example, the U.S. dollar was very strong (against the euro) between 1999
and the end of 2001. This rally was driven primarily by the dot-com boom and the
desire by foreign investors to participate in these elevated returns. This demand
for U.S. assets required foreign investors to sell their local currencies and purchase
U.S. dollars. Since the end of 2001, geopolitical uncertainty arose, the United States
started cutting interest rates, and foreign investors started to sell U.S. assets in
search of higher yields elsewhere. This required foreign investors to sell U.S. dollars,
increasing supply and lowering the dollar’s value against other major currency pairs.
The availability of funding or interest in buying a currency is a major factor that can
impact the direction that a currency trades. It was one of the primary drivers of the
U.S. dollar between 2002 and 2005, making foreign ofﬁcial purchases of U.S. assets
(also known as the Treasury International Capital Flow, or TIC data) an important
economic indicator.
WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?33Capital and Trade Flows
Capital ﬂows and trade ﬂows constitute a country’s balance of payments, which
quantiﬁes the amount of demand for a currency over a given period of time.
Theoretically, a balance of payments equal to zero is required for a currency to
maintain its current valuation. A negative balance of payments number, on the other
hand, indicates that capital is leaving the economy at a more rapid rate than it is
entering, and hence, it should fall in value.
This is particularly important in current conditions (at the time of this book’s
publication), where the United States is running a consistently large trade deﬁcit
without sufﬁcient foreign inﬂow to fund that deﬁcit. As a result of this very problem,
the trade-weighted dollar index fell 22% in value between 2003 and 2005. The
Japanese yen is another good example. As one of the world’s largest exporters, Japan
runs a very high trade surplus. Therefore, despite a zero interest rate policy that
prevents capital ﬂows from increasing, the yen has a natural tendency to trade lower
based on trade ﬂows, which is the other side of the equation. To be more speciﬁc,
following is a more detailed explanation of what capital and trade ﬂows encompass.
Capital Flows
Capital ﬂows measure the net amount of a currency that is being purchased or sold
due to capital investments. A positive capital ﬂow balance implies that foreign inﬂows
of physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed outﬂows. A negative
capital ﬂow balance indicates that there are more physical or portfolio investments
bought by domestic investors than foreign investors. There are generally two types
of capital ﬂows—physical ﬂows and portfolio ﬂows (which are further segmented
into equity markets and ﬁxed-income markets).
Physical Flows
Physical ﬂows encompass actual foreign direct investments by corporations such as
investments in real estate, manufacturing, and local acquisitions. All of these require
that a foreign corporation sell its local currency and buy the foreign currency, which
leads to movements in the FX market. This is particularly important for global
mergers and corporate acquisitions that involve more cash than stock.
Physical ﬂows are important to watch, as they represent the underlying changes
in actual physical investment activity. These ﬂows shift in response to changes in
each country’s ﬁnancial health and growth opportunities. Changes in local laws that
encourage foreign investment also serve to promote physical ﬂows. For example,
due to China’s entry into the WTO, its foreign investment laws have been relaxed.
As a result of China’s cheap labor and attractive revenue opportunities (population
WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?34of over 1 billion), corporations globally have ﬂooded China with investments. From
an FX perspective, in order to fund investments in China, foreign corporations need
to sell their local currency and buy Chinese renminbi (RMB).
Portfolio Flows in Equity Markets
As technology has enabled greater ease with respect to transportation of capital,
investing in global equity markets has become far more feasible. Accordingly, a
rallying stock market in any part of the world serves as an ideal opportunity for all,
regardless of geographic location. The result of this has become a strong correlation
between a country’s equity markets and its currency: If the equity market is rising,
investment dollars generally come in to seize the opportunity. Alternatively, falling
equity markets could prompt domestic investors to sell their shares of local publicly
traded ﬁrms to take advantage of investment opportunities abroad.
The attraction of equity markets over ﬁxed-income markets has increased across
the years. Since the early 1990s, the ratio of foreign transactions in U.S. government
bonds over U.S. equities has declined from 10 to 1 to 2 to 1. As indicated in
Figure 3.1, it is evident that the Dow had a high correlation (of approximately 81%)
with the U.S. dollar (against the EUR) between 1994 and 1999. In addition, from
1991–1999, the Dow increased 300%, while the USD index appreciated nearly 30%
for the same time period. As a result, currency traders closely followed the global
equity markets to predict short and intermediate term equity-based capital ﬂows.
However, this relationship shifted after the tech bubble burst in the United States as

WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?35foreign investors remained relatively risk averse causing a lower correlation between
the performance of the U.S. equity market and the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, a
relationship still exists, making it important for all traders to keep an eye on global
market performances in search of intermarket opportunities.
Portfolio Flows in Fixed-Income Markets
Just as the equity market is correlated to exchange rate movement, so too is the
ﬁxed-income market. In times of global uncertainty, ﬁxed-income investments can
become particularly appealing, due to the inherent safety they possess. As a result,
economies boasting the most valuable ﬁxed-income opportunities will be capable of
attracting foreign investment—which will naturally ﬁrst require the purchasing of
the country’s respective currency.
A good gauge of ﬁxed-income capital ﬂows are the short- and long-term yields of
international government bonds. It is important to monitor the spread differential
between the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the yield on foreign bonds because
international investors tend to move money from one country to another in search
of the highest yielding assets. When U.S. assets have one of the highest yields,
this encourages more investments in U.S. ﬁnancial instruments, hence beneﬁting
the U.S. dollar. When the United States has the lowest yields, this discourages
investments. Investors can also use short-term yields, such as the spreads on 2-year
government bonds, to gauge the short-term ﬂow of international funds. Aside from
government bond yields, Fed fund futures can also be used to estimate movement
of U.S. funds, as they price in the expectation of future Fed interest rate policy.
Euribor futures are a barometer for the Euro region’s expected future interest rates
and can give an indication of EU future policy movements. We will discuss how to
use ﬁxed-income products to trade FX further in our strategy section.
Trade Flows: Measuring Exports versus Imports
Trade ﬂows are the basis of all international transactions. Just as the investment
environment of a given economy is a key driver of its currency valuation, trade ﬂows
represent a country’s net trade balance. Countries that are net exporters—meaning
they sell more goods abroad than they buy—will experience a net trade surplus.
Countries that are net exporters are more likely to have their currency rise in value
because from the perspective of international trade, their currency is being bought
more than it is sold. This impacts currency ﬂows because international clients buying
the exported product/service must ﬁrst buy the currency of the exporting nation.
Countries who are net importers purchase more goods abroad than they sell,
creating a trade deﬁcit. These nations will generally see more downward than
upward pressure on their currencies because in order to purchase these foreign
goods, importers must sell their own currency and purchase the currency of the
WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?36country from which they are buying the good or service. This accordingly drives
down the value of the currency when all else is equal. This concept is important
because it is one of primary reasons why many economists say that certain currencies
need to fall to reverse burgeoning trade deﬁcits.
To understand this further, let’s imagine that the UK economy is booming,
and its stock market is performing well. Meanwhile, in the United States, a
lackluster economy is creating a shortage of investment opportunities. In this type
of environment U.S. investors will feel more inclined to sell their U.S. dollars and
buy British pounds to participate in the outperformance of the UK economy. When
they elect to do so, it results in the outﬂow of capital from the United States and
the inﬂow of capital into the United Kingdom. From an exchange rate perspective,
this would induce a fall in the USD coupled with a rise in the GBP, as demand for
USD declines and the demand for GBP increases, translating into strength for the
GBP/USD currency pair.
Even day and swing traders will ﬁnd it valuable to keep up with incoming
economic reports from the major economies.
Trading Tip: Charting Economic Surprises
One way for traders to stay on top of economic trends is to chart economic data
surprises against price action. Figure 3.2 illustrates how this can be done. The chart
graphs how much an economic indicator has deviated from its consensus forecast,
or the ‘‘surprise,’’ and stacks them on the same side and graphs price (blue line)
action when the data was release against the surprise, with a simple regression line
(white line). This can be done for all of the major currency pairs and provides a
visual guide to understanding whether price action has been in line with economic
fundamentals and can be used as a guide to future price action. Economic data can
be found on the calendars of any major forex website, and price action can generally
be downloaded from your trading platforms.
According to Figure 3.2, in November of 2004, there were 14 out of 15 positive
economic surprises and yet the dollar sold off against the euro during the month
of December, which was the month in which the economic data were released.
Although this methodology is not exact, the analysis is simple and past charts
have yielded some extremely useful clues to future price action. Figure 3.3 shows
how the EURUSD moved the following month. As you can see, the EURUSD
quickly corrected itself during the month of January, indicating that the fundamental
divergence from price action that occurred in December proved to be quite useful
to dollar longs, which harvested almost 600 pips as the euro quickly retracted a large
part of its gains in January. This method of analysis, called variant perception, was ﬁrst
invented by the legendary hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, who produced
24% average rates return for 30 consecutive years.

WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?38Although these charts will rarely offer such clear-cut signals, their analytical value
may also lie in spotting and interpreting the outlier data. Large positive and negative
surprises in economic data can often yield clues to future price action. If you go back
and look at the EURUSD charts, you will see that the record current account deﬁcits
in October 2004 were the catalyst that sent the dollar plunging over the next two
months. In many ways, economic fundamentals matter more in the foreign exchange
market than in any other market, and charts such as these could provide valuable
clues to price direction. Generally, the 15 most important economic indices are
chosen from each region, and then a price regression line is superimposed over the
past 20 days of price data.
■Technical Analysis
Prior to the mid-1980s, fundamental traders dominated the FX market. However,
with the rising popularity of technical analysis and the advent of new technologies,
the inﬂuence of technical trading on the FX market has increased signiﬁcantly. The
availability of high leverage also led to an increased number of high frequency and
momentum. They have become active participants in the FX market, with the acute
ability to inﬂuence currency prices.
Unlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses on the study of price
movements. Technical analysts use historical currency data to forecast the direction
of future prices. The underlying belief behind technical analysis is that all current
market information is already reﬂected in the price of that currency; therefore,
studying price action is all that is required to make informed trading decisions. In a
nutshell, technical analysis assumes that history will repeat itself.
Technical analysis is an extremely popular tool used by short- and medium-term
traders for analyzing the forex market. It works especially well in the currency
markets because short-term currency price ﬂuctuations are primarily driven by
human emotions or market perceptions. The primary tool in technical analysis
is price and charts. Traders will look for trends and patterns to identify trading
opportunities. The most basic concept of technical analysis is that markets have a
tendency to trend. Being able to identify trends in their earliest stage of development
is the key to technical analysis. Range trading is also very popular, and similar tools
can be used to identify these setups. Technical analysis integrates price action and
momentum to construct a pictorial representation of past currency price action and
to use this information to predict future performance. Technical analysis tools such
as Fibonacci retracement levels, moving averages, oscillators, candlestick charts, and
Bollinger bands provide further information on the value of the emotional extremes
of buyers and sellers. It also helps to gauge when greed and fear are the strongest.
There are basically two types of markets, trending or range bound, and in the trade
parameters section, we outline some rules that can help traders determine the type
WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?39of market they trading in right now and the sort of trading opportunities they should
be looking for.
Is Technical Analysis or Fundamental Analysis Better?
No one will ever win the age-long battle between technical and fundamental analysis.
However, most individual traders will start trading with technical analysis because
it is easier to understand and does not require hours of study. Technical analysts can
also follow many currencies and markets at one time, whereas fundamental analysts
tend to focus on a few pairs due to the overwhelming amount of data in the market.
Nonetheless, technical analysis works well because the currency market tends to
develop strong trends. Once technical analysis is mastered, it can be applied with
equal ease to any time frame or currency traded.
However, it is important to take both strategies into consideration, as fundamental
analysis can trigger technical movements such as breakouts or reversal in trends.
Technical analysis, on the other hand, can also explain moves that fundamentals
cannot, especially in quiet markets, causing resistance in trends or unexplainable
movements. For example, as shown in Figure 3.4, in the days leading up to
September 11, USDJPY had just broken out of a triangle formation and looked
poised to head higher. However, as the chart indicates, instead of breaking higher as
technicians may have anticipated, USDJPY broke down following the September 11,
2001, terrorist attacks and ended up hitting a low of 115.81 from a high of 121.88
on September 10.
■Currency Forecasting—What Bookworms
and Economists Look At
For more avid students of foreign exchange who want to learn more about
fundamental analysis and valuing currencies, this section examines the different
models of currency forecasting used by analysts of the major investment banks.
There are seven major models for forecasting currencies, which include the balance
of payments theory, purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, the monetary
model, the real interest rate differential model, the asset market model, and the
currency substitution model.
Balance of Payments Theory
The balance of payments theory states that exchange rates should be at their
equilibrium level, which is the rate that produces a stable current account balance.
Countries with trade deﬁcits experience a run on their foreign exchange reserves
due to the fact that exporters to that nation must sell that nation’s currency in order
WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?k

WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?41to receive payment. The cheaper currency makes the nation’s exports less expensive
abroad, which in turn fuels exports and brings the currency into balance.
What Is the Balance of Payments (BOP)?
The balance of payments account is divided into two parts: the current account and
the capital account. The current account measures trade in tangible, visible items
such as cars and manufactured goods; the trade balance is the surplus or deﬁcit
between exports and imports. The capital account measures ﬂows of money, such
as investments for stocks or bonds. Balance of payments data can be found on the
website of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Trade Flows
The trade balance of a country shows the net difference over a period of time
between a nation’s exports and imports. When a country imports more than it
exports, the trade balance is negative or is in a deﬁcit. If the country exports more
than it imports, the trade balance is positive or is in a surplus. The trade balance
reﬂects the redistribution of wealth among countries and is a major channel through
which the macroeconomic policies of a country may affect another.
In general, if a country has a trade deﬁcit, it is considered to be unfavorable, since
it negatively impacts the value of the nation’s currency. For example, if U.S. trade
ﬁgures show greater imports than exports, more dollars ﬂow out of the United
States and the value of the U.S. currency depreciates. A positive trade balance,
in comparison, will affect the dollar by causing it to appreciate against the other
currencies.
Capital Flows
In addition to trade ﬂows, there are also capital ﬂows that occur among countries.
They record a nation’s incoming and outgoing investment ﬂows, such as payments
for entire or parts of companies, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, real estate, and
factories. Capital ﬂows are inﬂuenced by many factors, including the ﬁnancial and
economic climate of other countries, and can be in the form of physical or portfolio
investments. In general, in developing countries, the composition of capital ﬂows
tends to be skewed toward foreign direct investment (FDI) and bank loans. For
developed countries, due to the strength of the equity and ﬁxed-income markets,
stocks and bonds appear to be more important than bank loans and FDI.
Equity Markets
Equity markets have a signiﬁcant impact on exchange rate movements because
they are a major place for high-volume currency movements. Their importance is
WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?42considerable for the currencies of countries with developed capital markets, where
a great amount of capital inﬂows and outﬂows occur, and where foreign investors
are major participants. The amount of the foreign investment ﬂows in the equity
markets is dependent on the general health and growth of the market, reﬂecting
the well-being of companies and particular sectors. Movements of currencies occur
when foreign investors move their money to a particular equity market. Thus,
they convert their capital in a domestic currency and push the demand for it
higher, making the currency appreciate. When the equity markets are experiencing
recessions, however, foreign investors tend to ﬂee, thus converting back to their
home currency and pushing the domestic currency down.
Fixed-Income (Bond) Markets
The effect that ﬁxed-income markets have on currencies is similar to that of the
equity markets and is a result of capital movements. An investor’s interest in the
ﬁxed-income market depends on the company’s speciﬁcs and credit rating, as well as
on the general health of the economy and the country’s interest rates. The movement
of foreign capital into and out of ﬁxed-income markets leads to change in the demand
and supply for currencies, hence impacting the currencies’ exchange rates.
Summary of Trade and Capital Flows
Determining and understanding a country’s balance of payments is perhaps the
most important and useful tool for those interested in fundamental analysis. Any
international transaction gives rise to two offsetting entries: trade ﬂow balance
(current account) and capital ﬂow balance (capital account). If the trade ﬂow balance
is a negative outﬂow, the country is buying more from foreigners than it sells
(imports exceed exports). When it is a positive inﬂow, the country is selling more
than it buys (exports exceed imports). The capital ﬂow balance is positive when
foreign inﬂows of physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed that
country’s outﬂows. A capital ﬂow is negative when a country buys more physical or
portfolio investments than are sold to foreign investors.
These two entries, trade and capital ﬂow, when added together signify a country’s
balance of payments. In theory, the two entries should balance and add up to zero
in order to provide for the maintenance of the status quo in a nation’s economy and
currency rates.
In general, countries might experience positive or negative trade, as well as
positive or negative capital ﬂow balances. In order to minimize the net effect of
the two on the exchange rates, a country should try to maintain a balance between
the two. For example, in the United States, there is a substantial trade deﬁcit, as
more is imported than is exported. When the trade balance is negative, the country
is buying more from foreigners than it sells, and therefore it needs to ﬁnance its
WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?43deﬁcit. This negative trade ﬂow might be offset by a positive capital ﬂow into the
country, as foreigners buy either physical or portfolio investments. Therefore, the
United States seeks to minimize its trade deﬁcit and maximize its capital inﬂows,
with hopes that the two will balance out.
A change in this balance is extremely signiﬁcant and carries ramiﬁcations that
run deep into economic policy and currency exchange levels. The net result of the
difference between the trade and capital ﬂows, positive or negative, will impact the
direction in which the nation’s currency will move. If the overall trade and capital
balance is negative, it will result in a depreciation of the nation’s currency, and if
positive, it will lead to an appreciation of the currency.
Clearly, a change in the balance of payments carries a direct effect for currency
levels. It is therefore possible for any investor to observe economic data relating to
this balance and interpret the results that will occur. Data relating to capital and
trade ﬂows should be followed most closely. For instance, if an analyst observes
an increase in the U.S. trade deﬁcit and a decrease in the capital ﬂows, a balance
of payments deﬁcit would occur, and as a result, an investor may anticipate a
depreciation of the dollar.
Limitations of BOP Model
The BOP model mainly focuses on traded goods and services, while ignoring
international capital ﬂows. Indeed, international capital ﬂows often dwarfed trade
ﬂows in the currency markets toward the end of the 1990s, and this oftentimes
balanced out the current account of debtor nations like the United States.
For example, in 1999, 2000, and 2001, the United States maintained a large
current account deﬁcit while the Japanese ran a large current account surplus.
However, during this same period in time the U.S. dollar rose against the yen even
though trade ﬂows were running against the dollar. The reason was that capital ﬂows
balanced out trade ﬂows, thus defying the BOP’s forecasting model for a period of
time. Indeed, the increase in capital ﬂows has given rise to the asset market model .
Note: It is probably a misnomer to call this theory the balance of payments theory
since it only takes into account the current account balance, not the actual balance
of payments. However, until the 1990s capital ﬂows played a very small role in the
world economy, so the main statistic viewed was the trade balance, which made up
the bulk of the balance of payments for most nations.
Purchasing Power Parity
Thepurchasing power parity (PPP) theory is based on the belief that foreign exchange
rates should be determined by the relative prices of a similar basket of goods between
two countries. Any change in a nation’s inﬂation rate should be balanced by an
opposite change in that nation’s exchange rate. Therefore, according to this theory,
WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?44when a country’s prices are rising due to inﬂation, that country’s exchange rate
should depreciate in order to return to parity.
PPP’s Basket of Goods
The basket of goods and services priced for the PPP exercise is a sample of all goods
and services covered by GDP. It includes consumer goods and services, government
services, equipment goods, and construction projects. More speciﬁcally, consumer
items include food, beverages, tobacco, clothing, footwear, rents, water supply,
gas, electricity, medical goods and services, furniture and furnishings, household
appliances, personal transport equipment, fuel, transport services, recreational
equipment, recreational and cultural services, telephone services, education services,
goods and services for personal care and household operation, and repair and
maintenance services.
Big Mac Index
One of the most well-known examples of PPP is The Economist ’s Big Mac Index. The
Big Mac PPP calculates the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the
same in America as elsewhere. Comparing these with actual rates helps to signal if
a currency is under- or overvalued. As described by The Economist, the index is a
lightheartedly guide to currency valuation. It was never intended as a precise gauge
of currency misalignment, but merely a tool to make exchange-rate theory more
digestible.
For example, in January 2015, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and
Chinese yuan was approximately 6.20. At the time, a Big Mac cost $4.79 in the
United States. In China, the same burger cost 17.15 yuan, or approximately $2.77
at market exchange. This means that based on the comparison between the two
burger prices, the Chinese yuan was undervalued by 42%.
OECD Purchasing Power Parity Index
The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) releases a
more formal index. Under a joint OECD-Eurostat PPP Program, the OECD and
Eurostat share the responsibility for calculating PPPs. Their latest information on
which currencies are under- or overvalued against the U.S. dollar can be found
on the OECD website at www.oecd.org. The OECD publishes a table that shows
the price levels for the major industrialized countries. Each column shows the
number of speciﬁed monetary units needed in each of the countries listed to buy
the same representative basket of consumer goods and services. In each case,
the representative basket costs a hundred units in the country whose currency is
speciﬁed. The chart that is then created compares the PPP of a currency with its
actual exchange rate. The chart is updated weekly to reﬂect the current exchange
rate. It is also updated about twice a year to reﬂect new estimates of PPP. The
PPP estimates are taken from studies carried out by the OECD; however, it should
WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?45not be taken as deﬁnitive. Different methods of calculation will arrive at different
PPP rates.
According to the OECD’s data as of April 17, 2015, the PPP value of the
Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar based on GDP is 0.6712. At the time, the
AUD/USD exchange rate was 0.7812. Using this model of valuation, this indicates
that the Australian dollar was 14% overvalued.
Limitations to Using Purchasing Power Parity
PPP theory should only be used for long-term fundamental analysis. While the
economic forces behind PPP will eventually equalize the purchasing power of
currencies, this can take many years. A time horizon of 5–10 years is typical.
PPP’s major weakness is that it assumes goods can be traded easily, without regard
to such things as tariffs, quotas, or taxes. For example, when the U.S. government
announces new tariffs on imported steel, the cost of domestic manufactured goods
goes up; but those increases will not be reﬂected in the U.S. PPP tables.
There are other factors that must also be considered when weighing PPP: inﬂation,
interest rate differentials, economic releases/reports, asset markets, trade ﬂows,
and political developments. Indeed, PPP is just one of several theories traders should
use when determining exchange rates.
Interest Rate Parity
The interest rate parity theory states that if two different currencies have different
interest rates, then that difference should be reﬂected in the premium or discount
for the forward exchange rate to prevent riskless arbitrage.
For example, if U.S. interest rates are 3% and Japanese interest rates are 1%,
then the U.S. dollar should depreciate against the Japanese yen by 2% in order
to prevent riskless arbitrage. This future exchange rate is reﬂected in the forward
exchange rate stated today. In our example, the forward exchange rate of the dollar
is said to be at discount because it buys fewer Japanese yen in the forward rate than
it does in the spot rate. The yen is said to be at a premium.
Interest rate parity has shown very little proof of effectiveness in recent years.
Oftentimes, currencies with higher interest rates rise and attract incoming invest-
ment, while currencies with low and falling interest rates decline as outﬂows slow.
The Monetary Model
According to the monetary model, exchange rates are determined by a nation’s
monetary policy. The premise is that countries that follow a stable monetary policy
over time should have appreciating currencies. Countries that have erratic monetary
policies or excessively expansionist policies should see the value of their currency
depreciate.
WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?46How to Use the Monetary Model
Three factors inﬂuence exchange rates under this theory:
1. A nation’s money supply
2. Expected future levels of a nation’s money supply
3. The growth rate of a nation’s money supply
All of these factors are key to understanding and spotting a monetary trend that
may force a change in exchange rates. For example, let’s assume that the Japanese
economy has been slipping in and out of recession for over a decade. Interest rates
are near zero and annual budget deﬁcits prevent the Japanese from spending their
way out of recession, which leaves only one tool left at the disposal of Japanese
ofﬁcials determined to revive Japan’s economy: printing more money. By buying
stocks and bonds, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is increasing the nation’s money supply,
which produces inﬂation, and this forces a change in the exchange rate. The example
in Figure 3.5 illustrates the effect of money supply changes to the Japanese yen using
the monetary model.
Indeed, it is in the area of excessive expansionary monetary policy that the
monetary model is most successful. One of the only ways a country can keep
its currency from sharply devaluing is by pursuing a tight monetary policy. For
example, during the Asian Currency Crisis, the Hong Kong dollar came under
attack from speculators. Hong Kong ofﬁcials raised interest rates to 300% to halt
the Hong Kong dollar from being dislodged from its peg to the U.S. dollar. The
tactic worked perfectly, as speculators were cleared out by such sky-high interest
rates. The downside was that the Hong Kong economy would slide into recession.
But in the end, the peg held and the monetary model worked.
Limitations of the Monetary Model
Very few economists rely solely on this model because it does not take into account
trade ﬂows and capital ﬂows. For example, throughout 2014 Australia had higher
interest rates, growth rates, and inﬂation rates than both the United States and the
European Union, yet, the AUD appreciated in value against both the dollar and the
euro. Indeed, the monetary model has greatly struggled since the dawn of freely

FIGURE 3.5 Monetary Model

which it often does, followed by a depreciating currency. But this does not take into
account the capital inﬂows that would take effect as a result of higher interest yields
or of an equity market that may be thriving in a booming economy—thus causing
the currency to possibly appreciate.
In any case, the monetary model is one of several valuation tools that can be
employed in tandem with other models to determine the direction an exchange rate
is heading.
Real Interest Rate Differential Model
According to the real interest rate differential theory, exchange rate movements are
determined by a country’s interest rate. The idea is that countries with high interest
rates should see their currency appreciate in value, while countries with low interest
rates should see their currency depreciate in value.
Basics of the Model
The basic premise of the model is that when a country raises its interest rates,
international investors will buy that currency because they ﬁnd its yield more
attractive. When a country lowers interest rates, they sell the currency. Figure 3.6

FIGURE 3.6 Real Interest Rate Model
WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?48shows how well this theory held up in 2003, when interest spreads were near their
widest levels in years.
The data from this graph show a mixed result. The Australian dollar had the
largest basis point spread and also had the highest return against the U.S. dollar,
which seems to vindicate the model, as investors bought up higher-yielding Aussie.
The same can be said for the New Zealand dollar, which also had a higher yield
than the U.S. dollar and gained 27% against USD. Yet the model becomes less
convincing when comparing the euro, which gained 20% against the dollar (more
than every currency except NZD), even though its basis point differential was
only 100 points. The model then comes under serious question when comparing
the British pound and the Japanese yen. The yen differential is –100, and yet it
appreciated almost 12% against the dollar. Meanwhile, the British pound gained
only 11% against the dollar even though it had a whopping 275 point interest rate
differential.
This model also stresses that one of the key factors in determining the severity of
an exchange rate’s response to a shift in interest rates is the expected persistence of
that shift. Simply put, a rise in interest rates that is expected to last for ﬁve years
will have a much larger impact on the exchange rate than if that rise were expected
to last for only one year.
Limitations to the Interest Rate Model
There is a great deal of debate among international economists over whether there
is a strong and statistically signiﬁcant link between changes in a nation’s interest rate
and currency price. The main weakness of this model is that it does not take into
account a nation’s current account balance, relying on capital ﬂows instead. Indeed,
the model tends to overemphasize capital ﬂows at the expense of numerous other
factors, such as political stability, inﬂation, and poor economic growth. Absent these
types of factors, the model can be very useful, since it is quite logical to conclude
that an investor will naturally gravitate toward the investment vehicle that pays a
higher reward.
The Asset Market Model
The basic premise of the asset market model theory is that the ﬂow of funds into the
ﬁnancial assets of a country such as equities and bonds increases the demand for that
country’s currency (and vice versa). As proof, advocates point out that the amount
of funds that are placed in investment products such as stocks and bonds now dwarf
the amount of funds that is exchanged as a result of the transactions in goods and
services for import and export purposes. The asset market theory is basically the
opposite of the balance of payments theory since it takes into account a nation’s
capital account instead of its current account.
WHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?49A Dollar-Driven Theory
Throughout 1999, many experts argued that the dollar would fall against the euro
on the grounds of the expanding U.S. current account deﬁcit and an overvalued
Wall Street. That was based on the rationale that non-U.S. investors would begin
withdrawing their funds from U.S. stocks and bonds into more economically sound
markets, which would weigh signiﬁcantly on the dollar. Yet, such fears have lingered
since the early 1980s when the U.S. current account soared to a record high 3.5%
of GDP.
In the two decades that followed, the balance of payments approach in assessing
the dollar’s behavior has given way to the asset market approach. This theory
continues to hold the most sway over pundits due to the enormity of U.S. capital
markets. In May and June of 2002, the dollar plummeted over 1000 points versus
the yen at the same time equity investors ﬂed U.S. equity markets due to the
accounting scandals that were plaguing Wall Street. As the scandals subsided toward
the end of 2002, the dollar rose 500 points from a low of 115.43 to close at 120.00
against the yen, even though the current account balance remained in massive deﬁcit
the entire time.
Limitations to the Asset Market Theory
It is frequently argued that over the long run, there is no relationship between
a nation’s equity market performance and the performance of its currency. See
Figure 3.7 for a comparison. Between April 2014 and April 2015, the German DAX
and EURUSD have a very weak correlation.
Also, what happens to a nation’s currency when the stock market is trading
sideways—stuck between bullish and bearish sentiments? That was the scenario in

older money making models, such as interest rate arbitrage, as a result. Only time
will tell whether the asset market model will hold up or merely be a short-term blip
on the currency forecasting radar.
The Currency Substitution Model
The currency substitution model is an enhanced version of the monetary model
because it takes into account investor ﬂows. It posits that the shifting of private
and public portfolios from one nation to another can have a signiﬁcant effect on
exchange rates. The ability of individuals to change their assets from domestic and
foreign currencies is known as currency substitution. When this model is added
to the monetary model, evidence shows that shifts in expectations of a nation’s
money supply can have a decided impact on that nation’s exchange rates. Simply
put, investors are looking at monetary model data and coming to the conclusion
that a change in money ﬂow is about to occur, thus affecting the exchange rate, so
they are investing accordingly, which turns the monetary model into a self-fulﬁlling
prophecy. Investors who subscribe to this theory are merely jumping on the currency
substitution model bandwagon on the way to the monetary model party.
The Yen Example
In the monetary model we talked about how the Japanese government was basically
printing yen and increasing the money supply when it bought stocks and bonds.
Monetary model theorists would say that this monetary growth would spark inﬂation
(more yen chasing fewer products), decrease demand for the yen, and ﬁnally cause
the yen to depreciate. A currency substitution theorist would agree with this scenario
and look to take advantage of this view by shorting the yen, or if they were long
the yen promptly getting out of the position. By taking this action, our yen trader
is helping to drive the market precisely in that direction, thus making the monetary
model theory a fate accompli. The step-by-step process is illustrated in Figure 3.8.
A. Japan announces new stock and bond buyback plan. Economists are now
predicting Japan’s money supply will dramatically increase.
B. Economists are also predicting a rise in inﬂation with the introduction of this
new policy. Speculators expect a change in the exchange rate as a result.
C. Economists expect interest rates to rise and inﬂation takes hold in the economy.
Speculators start selling short the yen in anticipation of a change in the exchange
rate.
D. Demand for the yen plummets as money ﬂows easily through the Japanese
economy and speculators dump yen in the markets.
E. The exchange rate for the Japanese yen changes dramatically as the yen falls
in value to foreign currencies, especially those that are easily substituted by
investors (read: liquid yen crosses).

Limitations of the Currency Substitution Model
Among the major, actively traded currencies, this model has not yet shown itself
to be a convincing, single determinant for exchange rate movements. While this
theory can be used with more conﬁdence in underdeveloped countries where ‘‘hot
money’’ rushes in and out of emerging markets with enormous effect, there are
still too many variables not accounted for by the currency substitution model. For
example, using the yen illustration in Figure 3.8, even though Japan may try to spark
inﬂation with its securities’ buyback plan, it still has an enormous current account
surplus that will continually prop up the yen. Also, Japan has numerous political
landmines it must avoid in its own neighborhood, and should Japan make it clear
that it is trying to devalue its currency, there will be enormous repercussions. These
are just two of many factors the substitution model does not take into consideration.
However, this model (like numerous other currency models) should be considered
part of an overall, balanced, FX forecasting diet.

A Deeper Look
at the FX Market
The next three chapters cover some of the unique studies that I have done on the
FX market that provide some telling details for both the novice and advanced
trader. This includes the following:
1. What are the best times to trade for individual currency pairs?
2. What are the most market moving economic data?
3. What are currency correlations, and how can we use them?
■What Are the Best Times to Trade for Individual
Currency Pairs?
The Foreign Exchange market operates 24 hours a day, making it nearly impossible
for a single trader to track every market movement and respond immediately at all
times. Timing is everything in currency trading. In order to devise an effective and
time-efﬁcient investment strategy, it is important to understand how much liquidity
there is around the clock to maximize the number of trading opportunities during a
trader’s own market hours. Besides liquidity, a currency pair’s trading range is also
heavily dependent on geographical location and macroeconomic factors. Knowing
what time of day a currency pair has the widest or narrowest trading range will
undoubtedly help traders improve their investment utility due to better capital
allocation. This section outlines the typical trading activity of major currency pairs
in different time zones to see when they are the most volatile. Figure 4.1 tabulates

around 7pm NY Time. During the Asian trading session, the largest volume is
transacted in Tokyo, followed by Hong Kong and Singapore. Trading in Tokyo can
be thin from time to time; but large investment banks and hedge funds are known to
try to use the Asian session to run important stop and option barrier levels, especially
during Sunday trade. Figure 4.2 provides a ranking of the different currency pairs
and their ranges during the Asian trading session.
More risk-tolerant traders may choose to trade USDJPY, GBPCHF, and GBPJPY
because their broad ranges provide short-term traders with lucrative proﬁt potentials,
with an average daily range of 90 pips. Foreign investment banks and institutional
investors who hold mostly dollar-dominated assets also contribute to the daily ﬂow
in USDJPY through their Japanese equity and bond markets transactions. The Bank
of Japan, who holds over $1.2 trillion of U.S. Treasury debt, is an active player with
their open market operations impacting the value of the currency. Last but not least,
large Japanese exporters may choose to repatriate their foreign earnings during the
Tokyo trading session, adding to the ﬂuctuations of the currency pair. A pair like
GBPJPY is especially volatile because large market participants may start to scale
into or out of positions ahead of the European market open.

More risk-averse participants may prefer to trade EURGBP, AUDUSD or
NZDUSD because they generally have less volatility, which can help to shield
traders and their investment strategies from irregular market movements caused by
aggressive intraday speculation.
U.S. Session (New York): 8am to 5pm EST
According to the Bank of International Settlements’ 2013 Triennial Central Bank
Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity, New York is the
second largest FX marketplace, accounting for 19% of total forex market volume.
The majority of the transactions during the U.S. session are executed between 8am
to 12pm NY Time, a period with high liquidity because the European and U.S.
markets overlap. After 12pm, trading starts to wind down with ranges narrowing
until the open of the Tokyo session. There can be some range expansions right
before the U.S. equity market closes but generally speaking the volatility is far less
than in the 8am to 12pm time period.
More risk-tolerant traders will ﬁnd GBPUSD, USDCHF, GBPJPY, and GBPCHF
attractive currency pairs to day trade because their daily ranges average around 120
pips (Figure 4.3). Trading in these currency pairs is particularly active because they
involve the U.S. dollar. When the U.S. equity and bond markets are open during
the U.S. session, foreign investors have to convert their domestic currency, such
as the euro, Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc into dollar-dominated assets in order
to carry out their transactions. With the market overlap, GBPJPY and GBPCHF have
the widest daily ranges. Most currencies in the FX market are quoted with U.S. dollar

as the base and the primary instrument traded before a cross. In AUDCAD for
example, for an Australian dollar to be converted into Canadian dollars, it usually
has to be traded against the USD ﬁrst, then CAD. This means an AUDCAD trade
typically involves two different currency transactions, AUDUSD and USDCAD,
and its volatility is ultima tely determined by the correlations of the two derived
currency pairs. Since AUDUSD and USDCAD are negatively correlated, which
means they tend to move in opposite directions, the volatility of AUDCAD is
ampliﬁed. Trading currency pairs with high volatility can be very lucrative, but in
doing it is also important to bear in mind that the risk involved can also be high.
Traders should continuously evaluate their strategies as market conditions change
because big moves in exchange rates can easily nullify their long-term strategies.
For the more risk-averse traders, USDJPY, EURUSD, and USDCAD can be
attractive pairs because they offer a dece nt trading range with lower risk. The highly
liquid nature of these currency pairs can also allow investor to secure proﬁts or
cut losses promptly and efﬁciently. The modest volatility of these pairs provides a
favorable environment for traders who want to pursue long-term strategies.
European Session (London): 3am to 12pm EST
London is the largest and most important dealing center in the world, with a market
share of more than 40% according to the BIS survey. Most of the dealing desks of
large banks are located in London, and the majority of major FX transactions are

completed during London hours due to the market’s high liquidity and efﬁciency.
The vast number of market participants and their high transaction value makes
London the most volatile FX trading session. Half of the 12 major pairs surpass the
80 pips line, the benchmark that we used to identify volatile pairs from the rest,
with GBPJPY and GBPCHF reaching as high as 140 pips and 146 pips, respectively,
during this time period (Figure 4.4).
With an average daily range of more than 140 pips, GBPJPY and GBPCHF are
two currency pairs that risk-tolerant traders love to trade. While such high volatility
can create much in the way of opportunity, it is important to realize that the
peak of daily trade activity in these two pairs generally happens during the London
session. With the London trading session overlapping both the New York and Tokyo
sessions, it is the perfect market for banks and institutional investors to reposition
their portfolios, and these adjustments contribute to the volatility in the market.
Traders with moderate risk proﬁles will also ﬁnd plenty of pairs to choose from.
EURUSD, USDCAD, GBPUSD, and USDCHF have an average range of 100 pips. As
mentioned earlier, trading in these pairs is active because large market participants
like to adjust their portfolios before the U.S. session opens.
For the more risk-averse, the NZDUSD, AUDUSD, EURCHF, and AUDJPY,
with an average of 50 pips range, are good choices as these pairs provide traders with
high interest income and proﬁt potential. These pairs allow investors to determine
their direction of movements based on fundamental economic factors and tend to
be less prone to losses caused by intraday speculative trades.

A DEEPER LOOK AT THE FX MARKET59during the European trading hours and 80% of the total average range of trading
for all of the currency pairs during U.S. trading hours. Just these percentages alone
tell day traders that if they are looking for high volatility and they don’t want to sit
in front of the screen all day, then the best time to trade is the U.S. and European
overlap (see Figure 4.5).
European–Asian Overlap: 2am to 4am EST
In contrast, there is far less volatility during the European and Asian market overlap
because of the slow trading during the Asian morning (see Figure 4.6). Of course,
the two-hour gap is also a relatively short time period. What is interesting about
this period, however, is that it usually precedes a breakout at the European market
open between 4am and 5am.

61CHAPTER 5
What Are the Most
Market Moving
Economic Data?
For any type of trader, fundamental or technical, the importance of economic
data cannot be underestimated. Having worked in the FX markets for many
years, I have learned that even though there are many traders who claim to be
pure technicians who do not factor fundamentals into their trading strategies, these
same traders have also frequently stayed out of the markets ahead of key economic
releases. In fact, many system traders will turn off their trading systems ahead of
big releases like the nonfarm payrolls reports. Of course, there are technicians
who factor fundamentals into their trading strategies, and some will even utilize
key economic releases to trade breakouts. All traders, fundamental, technical, or
both, will ﬁnd it valuable to know when important economic data are scheduled for
release, particularly those that will affect the U.S. dollar. This is because 90% of all
currency trades are against the greenback, making currencies naturally sensitive to
U.S. economic releases.
Based on a study that I conducted in 2004, the most signiﬁcant movements in
the dollar (against the euro) on the back of an economic release occurred in the
ﬁrst 20 minutes of trading following the release. Although more than 10 years have
passed, the results are still relevant, as the nonfarm payrolls report is, hands down,
the most important piece of U.S. data. On average, EURUSD would move 124
pips in the ﬁrst 20 minutes following the release. Excluding any release that came
WHAT ARE THE MOST MARKET MOVING ECONOMIC DATA?62in within 10% of estimates, the average move was 133 pips. On a daily basis, the
EURUSD moved an average of 193 and 208 pips, excluding its response to data
that met expectations. On average, the EURUSD moves 111 pips throughout the
course of the trading day. In contrast, the GDP reports result in an average move
of only 43 pips for the EURUSD in the ﬁrst 20 minutes and 110 pips on a daily
basis. The GDP ranking on the 20-minute table is higher than the daily table because
prices do retrace throughout the course of the day. Interestingly enough, the biggest
20-minute mover for the dollar may not be the most signiﬁcant market mover for
the rest of the trading day. Based on our own analysis of 20-minute and daily ranges,
we have created the following rankings for economic data.

market moving US economic release on a 20-minute basis, while nonfarm payrolls

while the trade balance fell to the fourth . As indicated in Figure 5.1, the trade
balance and inﬂation report switched places while the signiﬁcance of labor market
data held steady. Intuitively, this makes sense since the market shifts its attention
to different economic sectors and data based on the conditions of the domestic
economy—for example, trade balances may be more important when a country is
running unsustainable deﬁcits, while an economy that has difﬁculty creating jobs
will see unemployment data as more important. However in 2014, employment,
monetary policy decisions, and inﬂation data remain the most market-moving
releases.

GDP report has also become one of least important economic indicators on the U.S.
calendar, as it has led to some of the smallest relative movements in the EURUSD.

FIGURE 5.2 EURUSD Daily Chart
Source: eSignal
One possible explanation is that GDP is released less frequently than other data in
our study (it comes out quarterly versus monthly), but in general, the GDP report is
more prone to ambiguity and misinterpretation. For example, surging GDP brought
about by rising exports will be positive for the home currency; however, if GDP
growth is a result of inventory buildup, the effect on the currency may actually be
negative. Also, a large number of the components that comprise the GDP report
are known in advance of the release.
How Can You Use This to Your Beneﬁt?
For breakout traders, knowing which data have the potential of creating the largest
average range for a currency can be useful in determining how to weight positions
accordingly. For example, in Figure 5.2, which shows the daily EURUSD chart,
there is a triangle forming as prices consolidate signiﬁcantly. A breakout trader
could overweight positions ahead of the August 6 nonfarm payrolls release the
day before in the anticipation of a large breakout move following this release. In
contrast, the third bar of the consolidation was the day of the GDP release. As you
can see, the range was still comparatively tight, and given the knowledge that the
average instantaneous 20-minute move off of the GDP release is only a third of the
nonfarm payrolls move, the same breakout players hoping for a large move off of
that economic release should probably only put on half of the same position that
they would have put on for an NFP-based breakout. These same guidelines apply
WHAT ARE THE MOST MARKET MOVING ECONOMIC DATA?65for range traders or system traders. Nonfarm payrolls day would be a perfect day
to stand on the sidelines and wait for prices to settle, while the day that GDP is
released could still provide an opportunity for solid range or systems-based trading.
Overall, knowing which economic indicator moves the market the most is very
important for all traders. Being aware of the 20-minute versus daily range can also
be helpful because the exchange rate adjustment to economic news tends to be very
swift; any reaction beyond a 15–30 minute window after the data are released might
be the result of investor overreaction or trading related to customer ﬂow rather than
news alone. The GDP report is a perfect example—the 20-minute reaction ranking
is higher than the daily ranking.

What Are Currency
Correlations, and
How Can We Use
Them?
When it comes to forex, one of the most important things to know is that
currencies do not trade in a vacuum. In many cases, foreign economic
conditions, interest rates, and price changes affect much more than just a single
currency pair. Everything is interrelated in the forex market to some extent and
knowing the direction and how strong this relationship is can be an advantage; it
has the potential to be a great trading tool. The bottom line is that unless you only
want to trade one pair at a time, it can be very proﬁtable to take into account
how pairs move relative to one another. To do this, we use correlation analysis.
Correlations are calculations based on pricing data, and these numbers can help
gauge the relationships that exist between different currency pairs. The information
that the numbers provide can be a good aid for any traders who want to diversify
their portfolio, double up on positions without investing in the same currency pair,
or just get an idea of how much risk their trades are opening them up to. If used
correctly, this method has the potential to maximize gains, gauge exposure, and
help prevent counterproductive trading.
WHAT ARE CURRENCY CORRELATIONS, AND HOW CAN WE USE THEM?68■Positive/Negative Correlations—What They Mean
and How to Use Them
Knowing how closely correlated the currency pairs are in your portfolio is a great
way to measure your exposure and risk. You might think that you’re diversifying
your portfolio by investing in different pairs, but many of them have a tendency to
move in the same or opposite dir ection from one another. The correlations between
pairs can be strong or weak and last for weeks, months, or even years. Basically,
what a correlation number measures is an estimate of how often these pairs move
together or how opposite their actions are over a speciﬁed period of time. Any
correlation calculation will be in decimal form; the closer the number is to 1, the
stronger the connection between the two cu rrencies. For example, by looking at
the sample data in Table 6.1, we can see a +0.94 correlation between the EURUSD
and the NZDUSD over the last month. If you are not a fan of decimals, you can also
think of the number as a percentage by multiplying it by 100% (in this case, getting
a 94% correlation between the EURUSD and the NZDUSD). High decimals reﬂect
currency pairs that closely mirror one another, while lower numbers tell us that the
pairs do not usually move in a parallel fashion. Therefore, because there is a high
correlation in this particular pair, we can see that by investing in both the EURUSD
and the NZDUSD at the same time, you are virtually doubling up on a position.
Likewise, it might not be the best idea to go long one of the pairs and short the
other because a rally in one has a high likelihood of also setting off a rally in the
other currency pair. While this would not make your proﬁt and losses exactly zero
because they have different pip values, the two do move in such a similar fashion
that taking opposing positions could take a bite out of proﬁts or even cause losses.
Positive correlations aren’t the only way to measure similarities between pairings;
negative correlations can be just as useful. In this case, instead of a very positive
number, we are looking for a highly negative one. The closer the number is to
–1, the increasingly connected the two currencies movements are, but this time in
the opposite direction. Again, we can use the EURUSD as an example. While we
just saw a strong positive correlation with the NZDUSD, the EURUSD has a very
negative relationship with the USDCHF. Between these two currency pairs, the
correlation has been –0.98 over the last year and –0.99 over the past month. This
number indicates that these two pairs have a strong propensity to move in opposite
directions. Therefore, buying both currency pairs at the same time will often lead
to gains in one and losses in the other. Buying one pair and selling the other would
be an intensiﬁcation of risk that can be v iewed as doubling up on t he same or similar
position.
WHAT ARE CURRENCY CORRELATIONS, AND HOW CAN WE USE THEM?69Important Fact about Correlations: They Change
Anyone who has ever traded the FX market knows that currencies are very dynamic;
economic conditions, both sentiment and pricing, change every day. Because of this,
the most important aspect to remember when analyzing currency correlations is
that they can also change overtime. The str ong correlations that are calculated today
might not be the same this time next year, or even next month. Due to the constant
reshaping of the forex environment, it is imperative to keep current if you decide
to use this method for trading. For example, over a one-month period that we
observed, the correlation between USDCAD and USDJPY was 0.06. This is a very
low number and would indicate that the pairs do not really share any deﬁnitive trend
in their movements. However, if we look at the three-month data for the same time
period, the number increases to 0.12 and then to 0.59 for six months, and ﬁnally
to 0.80 for a year. In this particular example, we can see that there was a recent
breakdown in the relationship between these two pairs. What was once a strongly
positive association over time has deteriorated completely in the short term. On
the other hand, the correlation between USDCHF and AUDUSD strengthened in
more recent reports. The correlation between these two pairs started at –0.78 for
the year and edged up to –0.94 for the last month. This suggests that there is an
increasing probability that if one of the trades became proﬁtable, the other would as
well. The opposite is also true that if one of the trades incurs signiﬁcant losses, the
other has a very high likelihood of also ending up unproﬁtable.
An even more dramatic example of the extent to which these numbers can change
can be found in the GBPUSD and AUDUSD pai rs; there was a –0.79 correlation
between the two for the yearlong data. However, while these two tended to move
in reasonably opposite directions in the long term, over the month of February
2005, for example, they were positively correlated with a +0.76 reading. The
major events that change the amount and even direction that pairs are correlated are
usually associated with major economic developments, such as interest rate changes
or quantitative easing.
Calculating Correlations Yourself
Because correlations have the tendency to shift overtime and the data in the table
could be stale by the time you read it, the best way to keep current on the direction
and strength of your pairings is to calculate them yourself. Although it might seem
like a tricky concept, the actual process can be made quite easy. The simplest way
to calculate the numbers is to use Microsoft Excel. In Excel, you can take the
currency pairs that you want to derive a correlation from over a speciﬁc time period

WHAT ARE CURRENCY CORRELATIONS, AND HOW CAN WE USE THEM?71and just use the correlation function. Calculating this on a one-year, six-month,
three-month, and then on a one-month and six-month trailing basis provides the
most comprehensive view of the positive and negative correlation between different
currency pairs; however, you can decide which or how many of these readings you
want to analyze.
Breaking the process down step by step, let’s take a look at how a simple
correlation between the USDGBP and USDCHF can be calculated. First, you’ll
need to get the pricing data for the two pairs. To keep organized, label one column
GBP and the other CHF and then put in the daily or weekly values of these currencies
using the last price and pairing them with the USD for whatever time period you
want to use. At the bottom of the two columns, go to an empty slot and type
in=CORREL. Highlight all of the data in one of the pricing columns, type in a
comma, and then do the same thing for the other currency; the number produced
is your correlation. Although it is not necessary to update your numbers every day,
updating them every few weeks or at the ve ry least once a month is generally a
good idea.

Trade Parameters
for Various Market
Conditions
After learning about the emergence of the foreign exchange market, who the
major players are, signiﬁcant historical milestones, and what moves the markets,
it is time to move on and discuss some of my favorite strategies for trading currencies.
However, before I even begin going over these strategies, the most important ﬁrst
step for any trader, regardless of the market that you are trading in, is to create a
trading journal.
■Keep a Trading Journal
Through my experience, I have learned that being a successful trader is not about
ﬁnding the holy grail of indicators that can perfectly forecast movements 100% of
the time, but instead, to develop discipline. I cannot undermine the importance of
‘‘the journal’’ as the primary ﬁrst step to becoming a successful and professional
trader. While working on the Inter-bank FX trading desk at J.P. Morgan and then
on the Cross-Markets trading desk after the merger with Chase, the trading journal
mentality was engrained into the minds of every dealer and proprietary trader on the
trading ﬂoors, regardless of rank. The reason was simple—the bank was providing
the capital for trading and we needed to be held accountable, especially since each
transaction involved millions of dollars. For every trade that was executed, we
TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS74needed to have a solid rationale as well as justiﬁcation for the choice of entry and exit
levels. More speciﬁcally, you had to know where to place your exit points before
you placed the trade to approximate worst case losses and to manage risk.
With this sort of accountability, the leading banks of the world are able to breed
successful and professional traders. For individual traders, this practice is even more
important because you are trading with your own money and not someone else’s.
Bank traders are trading with someone else’s money so regardless of how poorly
they perform over a one- or two-week basis, they will receive their paycheck twice
a month. At a bank, traders have plenty of time to make the money back without any
disruptions to their daily way of life—unless of course they lose $1 million in one
day. As an individual trader—you do not have this luxury. When you are trading
with your own money, each dollar lost is a dollar less that you own. So even though
you should only be trading with risk capital, or money that would not otherwise be
used for rent or groceries, one way or the other, the pain is felt. To avoid repeating
the same mistakes and taking large losses, I cannot stress enough the importance of
keeping a trading journal. The journal is designed to ensure that as a trader, you
only take calculated losses and learn from each mistake. The trading journal setup
that I recommend should be broken up into three parts:
1. Currency pair checklist
2. Trades that I am waiting for
3. Existing or completed trades
Currency Pair Checklist
The ﬁrst section of your trading journal should consist of a spreadsheet that can be
printed out and completed every day. This purpose of this checklist is to get a feel
of the market and to identify trades. It should list of all of the currency pairs that are
offered for trading on the left column, followed by three columns for the current,
high, and low prices, and then a series of triggers laid out as a row on the right
hand side. Newer traders should start with following only the four major currency
pairs, which are the EURUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, and the GBPUSD, and then
gradually add the AUDUSD, USDCAD, and NZDUSD, followed by the nondollar
pairs. Although the checklist that I have created is fairly detailed, I ﬁnd that it is
a very useful daily exercise and should take no more than 20 minutes to complete
once the appropriate indicators are saved on the charts. The purpose of this checklist
is to get a clear visual of which currencies are trending and which are range trading.
Comprehending the big picture is the ﬁrst step to trading successfully. Too often
have I seen traders fail because they lose sight of the overall environment that they
are trading in. The worst thing to do is to trade blindly. Trying to pick tops or
bottoms in a strong trend or buying breakouts in a range-bound environment can
lead to signiﬁcant losses. Just take a look at Figure 7.1 of the EURUSD. If you tried
TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS75
FIGURE 7.1 EURUSD Chart
Source: eSignal
TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS76to pick bottoms in this pair, it would have led to an entire year of frustrating and
unsuccessful trading. In trending environments, traders will ﬁnd a higher success
rate by buying on retracements in an uptrend or selling on rallies in a downtrend.
Picking tops and bottoms should only be a strategy that is used in clear range trading
environments and even with that, traders need to be careful of contracting ranges
that can lead to breakout scenarios.
A simpliﬁed version of the daily market overview sheet that I use is shown in
Figure 7.2.
As you can see in Figure 7.2, the ﬁrst two columns after the daily high and low
prices are the levels of the 10-day high or low. Recording this price helps to identify
where current prices are within previous price action. This helps traders get a gauge
of whether we are pressing toward a 10-day high or low or if we are simply trapped
in the middle of the range. Yet the prices alone do not provide enough information
to determine if we are in a trending or a range-bound environment. The next ﬁve
indicators is a checklist for determining a trending environment. The more X marks
in this section, the stronger the trend.
The ﬁrst column in the trending indicator group is the ‘‘ADX (14) above 25.’’
ADX is the Accumulation Distribution Index, which is the most popular used
indicator for determining the strength of a trend. If the index reading is above 25,
it indicates that a trend has developed. Generally speaking, the greater the number,
the stronger the trend. The next column is Bollinger Bands. When strong trends
develop, the pair will frequently tag and cross either the upper or lower Bollinger
Band. The next three trend indicators are the longer term moving averages. A
break above or below these moving averages may also be indicative of a trending
environment. With moving averages, crossovers in the direction of the trend can be
used as a further conﬁrmation. If there are two or more Xs in this section, traders
should be looking for opportunities to buy on dips in an uptrend or sell on rallies in a
downtrend rather than selling at the top and buying back at the bottom of the range.
The last section of the trading journal is indications of range. The ﬁrst indicator is
also ADX, but this time, we are looking for ADX below 25, which signals that the
currency pair’s trend is weak. Next, we look at the traditional oscillators, RSI and
stochastics. If the ADX is weak and there is signiﬁcant technical resistance above,
provided by indicators such as moving averages or Fibonacci retracement levels,
and RSI and/or stochastics are at overbought or oversold levels, we identify an
environment that is highly conducive to range trading.
Of course, the market overview sheet is not foolproof, and just because you have
a lot of X marks in either the trend or range group doesn’t mean that a trend will
not fade or a breakout will not occur. Yet, what this spreadsheet will do is prevent
traders from trading blindly and ignoring the broader market conditions. It provides
traders with a launching pad from which to identify the day’s trading opportunities.

TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS78Trades That I Am Waiting For
The next section in the trading journal lists out the possible trades for the day. Based
on an initial overview of the charts, this section is where you should list the trades
for which you are waiting. A sample entry would look like the following:
April 5, 2015
Buy AUDUSD on a break of 0.7850 (previous day high)
Stop at 0.7800 (50-day SMA)
Target 1—0.7925 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement of Nov-Mar bull wave)
Target 2—0.8075 (Upper Bollinger)
Target 3—10-day Trailing Low
As soon as your entry level is reached, you know exactly how to take action and
where to place your stops and limits. Of course, it is also important to take a quick
glance at the market to make sure that the trading conditions that you were waiting
for are still intact. For example, if you were looking for a strong breakout with no
retracement to occur at the entry level, when it does break, you want to make sure
that the break has decent momentum. This exercise will help you develop a plan of
action to approach your trading day. Before every battle, warriors will regroup to
go over the plan of attack—in trading, you want to have the same mentality. Plan
and prepare for the worst-case scenario and know your plan of attack for the day!
Existing or Completed Trades
This section is developed and used to enforce discipline and to learn from your
mistakes. At the end of each trading day, it is important to review this section to
understand why certain trades resulted in losses and others in proﬁts. The purpose
of this section is to identify trends. To understand why this is important, let’s look
at an example that is completely unrelated to trading. On a normal given day,
most people will subconsciously inject a lot of ‘‘ums’’ or ‘‘uhs’’ into their daily
conversation. However, most of these people do not even realize that they are even
doing so until someone records their conversation and replays it back to them. This
is one of the ways that professional presenters and newscasters train to kick the
habit of using placeholder words. Having worked with over 65,000 traders, too
often have I seen these traders make the same mistakes repeatedly. This includes
taking proﬁts too early, letting losses run, getting emotional about trading, ignoring
economic releases, or entering a trade prematurely. Keeping a record of previous
trades is like keeping a recording of your conversations. When you ﬂip back to the
trades that you have completed, you may have a perfect map of what strategies have
or have not been proﬁtable for you. The reason why a journal is so important is
because it minimizes the emotional intervention of trades. I frequently see novice
traders take proﬁts early but let losses run. The following are two samples of trade
journal entries that could have provided learning opportunities:
TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS79February 12, 2015
Trade: Short 3 lots of EURUSD @ 1.1045
Stop: 1.1195 (former all-time high)
Target: 1.0800
Result: Trade closed on Feb 13, 2015—stopped out of the 3 lots @ 1.1195
(–150 pips)
Comments: Got margin call! It broke the all-time high, I thought it was going
to reverse, did not stick to stop—kept letting losses run, eventually margin
call closed out all positions. Note to self: MAKE SURE STICK TO STOPS!
April 3, 2015
Trade: Long 2 lots of USDCAD @ 1.2135
Stop: 1.2000 (strong technical support—conﬂuence of 50-day moving average
and 68% Fibonacci retracement of Feb—March rally)
Target: First lot @ 1.2295 (upper Bollinger and 5 pips shy of 1.2300 psychological
resistance)
Second lot @ 1.2450 (Former head and shoulders support turned resistance,
100-day SMA)
Result: Trade closed on April 5, 2015—stopped out of the 2 lots at 1.2000
(–135 pips)
Comments: USDCAD did not continue uptrend and was becoming overbought,
I didn’t see that ADX was weakening and falling from higher levels, there was
also a divergence in Stochastics. Note to self: MAKE SURE TO LOOK FOR
DIVERGENCES NEXT TIME!
Unlike many traders, the best trades in my opinion are the trades where both
technicals and fundamentals support the trade. In general, I prefer to stay out of
trades that contradict my fundamental outlook. For example, if there is a bullish
formation in both the GBPUSD and the AUDUSD due to U.S. dollar weakness,
but the Bank of England has ﬁnished raising interest rates, while the Reserve
Bank of Australia has full intentions of tightening to tame the strength of the
Australian economy, I would most likely choose to express my bearish dollar view
in the AUDUSD rather than the GBPUSD. My bias for choosing the AUDUSD
over the GBPUSD would be even stronger if the AUDUSD already offered a
higher interest rate differential than the GBPUSD. I seen technicals thwarted by
fundamentals so often that now I always incorporate both into my trading strategy.
I use a combination of technical, fundamental, and positioning, and am generally
also a trend follower. I also typically use a top-down approach that involves the
following:
1. I will start by taking an overall technical survey of the market and pick the
currency pairs that have retraced to attractive levels for entry in order to
participate in a medium term fundamentally supportive trend.
TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS802. For currencies with a dollar component (i.e., not the crosses), I determine if my
initial technical view for that pair coincides with my fundamental view on the
dollar, as well as my view on how upcoming U.S. releases may impact trading
for the day. The reason why I look at the dollar speciﬁcally is because 80% of all
currency trades involve the dollar, which makes U.S. fundamentals particularly
important.
3. If it is a cross, I will proceed by determining if the technical view coincides with
the fundamental outlook using Fibonacci retracements, ADX, moving averages,
oscillators, and other technical tools.
4. Then I like to look at positioning using the Commitment of Traders Report or
the FXCM Speculative Sentiment index to see if it supports the trade.
5. If I am left with two equally compelling trade ideas, I will choose the one with
a positive interest rate differential.
Have a Toolbox—Use What Works for the Current Market
Environment
Once you have created a trading journal, it is time to ﬁgure out which indicators to
lay on your charts. The reason why a lot of traders fail is because they neglect to
realize that their favorite indicators are not foolproof. Buying when stochastics are
in oversold territory and selling when it is in overbought territory is a strategy that
is used quite often by range traders, to a great deal of success, but once the market
stops range trading and begins to trend, then relying on stochastics could lead to
tremendous amount of losses. In order to become consistently proﬁtable, successful
traders need to learn to be adaptable.
One of the most important practices that every trader must understand is to be
conscious of the environment that they are trading in. Every trader needs to have
some sort of checklist that will help to classify the trading environment so that
they can determine whether the market is trending or range bound. Deﬁning
trade parameters is one of the most important disciplines of trading. Too many
traders have tried to pick the top within a trend, only to wind up with consistently
unproﬁtable trades.
Although deﬁning trade parameters is important to traders in any market
(currencies, futures, equities), it is particularly important in the currency market
since over 80% of the volume is speculative in nature. This means that currencies
can spend a very long period of time in a certain trading environment. Also, the
currency market obeys technical analysis particularly well, given its large scale and
number of participants.
There are basically two types of trading environments, which means that at any
point in time an instrument is either range trading or trending. The ﬁrst step every
trader needs to take is to deﬁne the current trading environment. The shortest time
TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS81frame that traders should start looking at when their trading day starts are daily
charts, even if you are trading on a 5-minute time frame.
■Step #1: Determine the Trading Environment
Rules to Determining Trading Environment
There are many different ways that traders can determine whether a currency pair
is range trading or trending. Of course, many people do it visually, but having set
rules will help to keep traders out of trends that may be fading or to prevent traders
from getting into a range trade in the midst of a possible breakout. In Figure 7.3, I
have outlined some of the rules that I look for in order to classify a currency pair’s
trading environment.
Proﬁling a Range Environment
Look for:
1.ADX (Average Directional Index) less than 20 —The Average Directional Index is
one of the primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a
trend. When ADX is less than 20, this suggests that the trend is weak, which
is generally characteristic of range-bound market. If ADX is less than 20 and
trending downward, it provides a further conﬁrmation that the trend is not only
weak but will probably stay in a range-trading environment for a while longer.
2.Decreasing implied volatility —There are many ways to analyze volatility. What I
like to do is actually track short-term versus long-term volatility. When short-
term volatility is falling, especially after a burst above long-term volatility, it
is usually indicative of a reversion to range trading scenarios. Volatility usually

TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS82blows out when a currency pair experiences sharp, quick moves. It contracts
when ranges are narrow and the trading is very quiet in the markets. The lazy
man’s version of the way I track volatility is Bollinger Bands, which is actually
also a fairly decent measure for determining volatility conditions. A narrow
Bollinger Band suggests that ranges are small and there is low volatility in the
markets, while wide Bollinger Bands are reﬂective of large ranges and a highly
volatile environment. In a range-trading environment, we are looking for fairly
narrow Bollinger Bands, ideally in a horizontal formation similar to the USDJPY
chart in Figure 7.4.
3.Risk reversals ﬂipping between calls and puts : A risk reversal consists of a pair of
options, a call and a put, on the same currency. Risk reversals have both the
same expiration (1 month) and sensitivity to the underlying spot rate. They are
quoted in terms of the difference in volatility between the two options. While
in theory these options should have the same implied volatility in practice, these
volatilities often differ in the market. Risk reversals can be seen as having a
market polling function. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates
that the market prefers calls over puts. The reverse is true if the number is
strongly in favor of puts versus calls. Thus, risk reversals can be used as a
substitute for gauging positions in the FX market. In an ideal environment, far
out of the money calls and puts should have the same volatility. However, this
is rarely the case, since there is generally a sentiment bias in the markets that
is reﬂected in risk reversals. In range-bound environments, risk reversals tend
FIGURE 7.4 USDJPY Bollinger Band Chart
TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS83to ﬂip between favoring calls and puts at nearly zero (or equal). This indicates
that there is indecision among bulls and bears, and there is no strong bias in
the markets.
What Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?
According to the risk reversals in Figure 7.5, we can see that the market is strongly
favoring yen calls (JC) and dollar puts over the long term. EURUSD short-term
risk reversals are near choice, which is what you are looking for when proﬁling a
range-bound environment. Risk reversal information used to be readily available
but is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd these days. Currently, the only place we know of that
provides this information is the Bloomberg Professional Terminal, which costs over
US$1500 a month.
Identifying a Trending Environment
Look for three things:
1.ADX (Average Directional Index) greater than 20 —As mentioned earlier when we
talked about range-trading conditions, the Average Directional Index is one of
the primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a trend. In
a trending environment, we look for ADX to be greater than 25 and rising. If
ADX is greater than 25 but sloping downward, especially off of the extreme 40
level, you have to be careful of aggressive trend positioning since it may indicate
that the trend is waning.
2.Momentum consistent with trend direction —In addition to using ADX, I also
recommend looking for conﬁrmation of a trending environment through
momentum indicators. Traders should look for momentum to be consistent

FIGURE 7.5 Risk Reversals
TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS84with the direction of the trend. Most currency traders will look for oscillators to
point strongly in the direction of the trend. For example, in an uptrend, trend
traders will look for the moving averages, RSI, stochastics, and MACD to all
point strongly upward. In a downtrend, they will look for these same indicators
to point downward. Some currency traders use the momentum index, but in
my experience, it is less popular and reliable. Instead, one of the strongest
momentum indicators is a perfect order of moving averages. A perfect order is
when we have the moving averages line up perfectly: that is, for an uptrend,
the 10-day SMA is greater than the 20-day SMA, which is greater 50-day SMA.
The 100-day SMA and the 200-day SMA are below the shorter-term moving
averages. In a downtrend, a perfect order would be when the shorter-term
moving averages stack up below the longer-term moving averages.
3.Options (risk reversals)— With a trending environment, we are looking for risk
reversals to strongly favor calls or puts. When one side of the market is laden
with interest, it is usually indicative of a strong trending environment or that a
contra-trend move may be brewing if risk reversals are at extreme levels.
■Step #2: Determine the Time Frame for Trade
Once you have determined that a currency pair is either range-bound or trending,
it is time to determine how long you plan on holding the trade. The following is a
set of guidelines and indicators that I use for trading different time frames. Not all
of the guidelines need to be met, but the more guidelines that are met, the more
solid the trading opportunity.
Intraday Trade (Range)
Rules:
1. Use hourly charts to determine entry points and daily charts to conﬁrm that a
range trade exists on a longer-time frame.
2. Use oscillators to determine entry point within range.
3. Look for short-dated risk reversals to be near choice.
4. Look for reversal in oscillators (RSI or stochastics at extreme point).
5. Trade stronger when prices fail at key resistance or hold key support levels (use
Fibonacci retracement points and moving averages).
Indicators Used:
Stochastics, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, options, Fibonacci retracement
levels
TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS85Medium-Term Range Trade
Rules:
1. Use daily charts.
2. There are two ways to range trade medium term—position for upcoming range
trading opportunities or get involved in existing ranges.
3.Upcoming range opportunities : Look for high-volatility environments, where short-
term implied volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than longer-term volatilities.
Seek reversion back to the mean environments.
4.Existing ranges : Use Bollinger Bands to identify existing ranges.
5. Look for reversals in oscillators such as RSI and stochastics.
6. Make sure ADX is below 25 and ideally falling.
7. Look for medium-term risk reversals near choice.
8. Conﬁrm with price action—failure at key range resistances and bounces on key
range supports (using traditional technical indicators).
Indicators:
Options, Bollinger Bands, stochastics, MACD, RSI, Fibonacci retracement
levels
Medium-Term Trend Trade
Rules:
1. Look for ranges on daily charts and use weekly charts for conﬁrmation.
2. Refer back to the characteristics of a trending environment—look for those
parameters to be met.
3. Buy breakout/retracement scenarios on key Fibonacci levels or moving averages.
4. Look for no major resistance levels in front of trade.
5. Look for candlestick pattern conﬁrmation.
6. Look for moving average conﬂuence to be on same side of trade.
7. Enter on a break of signiﬁcant high or low.
8. The ideal is to wait for volatilities to contract before getting in.
9. Look for fundamentals to also be supportive of trade—growth and interest
rates. You want to see a string of economic surprises or disappointments
depending on directional bias.
Indicators
ADX, Parabolic SAR, RSI, Ichimoku Clouds, Elliot waves, Fibonacci
TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS86Medium-Term Breakout Trade
Rules:
1. Use daily charts.
2. Look for contraction in short-term volatility to a point where it is sharply below
long-term volatility.
3. Use pivot points to determine whether a break is a true break or a false break.
4. Look for moving average conﬂuences to be supportive of trade.
Indicators

■Risk Management
Although risk management is one of the more simple topics to grasp, it is also one
of the most important. Too often we have seen traders turn winning positions into
losing positions and solid strategies result in losses instead of proﬁts. The fact of the
matter is that regardless of how intelligent and knowledgeable a trader may be about
the markets, their own psychology will cause them to lose money. Why does this
happen? Are the markets really so enigmatic that few can proﬁt? Or is there simply
a common mistake that virtually all traders are prone to making? The answer is the
latter. And the good news is that the problem, while it can be an emotionally and
psychologically challenging, is ultimately fairly easy to grasp and solve.
Most traders lose money simply because they have no understanding or place no
importance in risk management . Risk management involves essentially knowing how
much you are willing to risk and how much you are looking to gain. Without a
sense of risk management, most traders simply hold on to losing positions for an
extremely long amount of time, but take proﬁts on winning positions prematurely.
The result is a seemingly paradoxical scenario that in reality is all too common: The
trader ends up having more winning positions than losing ones, but ends up with a
negative P/L. So, what can traders do to ensure they have solid risk management
habits? There are a few key guidelines that every trader, regardless of their strategy
or what they are trading, should keep in mind:
■Risk-reward ratio . Traders should look to establish a risk-reward ratio for every
trade they place. In other words, they should have an idea of how much they are
willing to lose, and how much they are looking to gain. Generally, the risk-reward
ratio should be at least 1:2, if not more. Having a solid risk-reward ratio can
prevent traders from entering positions that ultimately are not worth the risk.
■Stop-loss orders . Traders should also employ stop-loss orders as a way of specifying
the maximum loss they are willing to accept. By using stop-loss orders, traders
TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS87can avoid the common predicament of being in a scenario where they have many
winning trades but a single loss large enough to eliminate any trace of proﬁtability
in the account. Trailing stops to lock in proﬁts are particularly useful. A good
habit of more successful traders is to employ the rule of moving your stop to
break even as soon as your position has proﬁted by the same amount that you
initially risked through the stop order. At the same time, some traders may also
choose to close a portion of their position.
For those looking to add to a winning position or go with trend, the best strategy
is to treat it as if it were a new trade of its own, independent of the winning position.
If you are going to add to a winning position, perform the same analysis of the chart
that you would if you had no position at all. If a trade continues to go in your favor,
you can also close out part of the position while trailing your stop higher on the
remaining lots that you are holding. Try thinking about your risk and reward on
each separate lot that you have bought if they are at different entry points as well. If
you buy a second lot 50 pips above your ﬁrst entry point, don’t use the same stop
price on both, but manage the risk on the second lot independently from the ﬁrst.
Using Stop-Loss Orders to Manage Risk
Given the importance of money management to successful trading, using the stop-
loss order is imperative for any trader looking to succeed in the currency market.
Stop-loss orders allow traders to specify the maximum loss they are willing to
accept on any given trade. If the market reaches the rate the trader speciﬁes in
his/her stop-loss order, then the trade will be closed immediately. As a result, using
stop-loss orders allows you to know how much you are risking at the time you enter
the trade.
There are two parts to successfully using a stop-loss order: (1) initially placing
the stop at a reasonable level and (2) trailing the stop—or moving it forward toward
proﬁtability—as the trade progresses in your favor.
Placing the Stop Loss
We recommend two ways of placing a trailing stop-loss order:
■The ﬁrst is a two-day low method . These volatility-based stops involve placing your
stop-loss order approximately 10 to 20 pips below the two-day low of the pair.
For example, if the low on the EURUSD’s most recent candle was 1.1200, and
the previous candle’s low was 1.1100, then the stop should be placed around
1.1090—10 pips below the two-day low—if a trader is looking to get long. This
type of trailing stop allows you to keep tight control of the position and minimizes
the time in trade. The downside is that it can be closed prematurely during a brief
period of consolidation.
TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS88■Parabolic SAR . Another form of volatility-based stop is the parabolic SAR, an
indicator that is found on many currency trading charting applications. This
indicator graphically displays a small dot at the point on the chart where the stop
should be placed. The beneﬁt of parabolic SAR is that it is dynamic and generally
further away from the current price.
There is no magic formula for what works best in every situation, but the
following is an example of how these stops could be used.
Upon entering a long position, determine where support is and place a stop 20
pips below support. For example, let’s say this is 60 pips below the entry point. If
the trade earns a proﬁt of 60 pips, close half of my position using a market order,
then move the stop up to the entry point. At this point, trail the stop 60 pips behind
the moving market price. If the parabolic SAR moves up so that it is above the entry
point, you could switch to using parabolic SAR as the stop level. Of course, during
the day, there can be other signals that could prompt you to move your stop. If the
price breaks through a new resistance level, that resistance then becomes support.
You can place a stop 20 pips below that support level, even if it is only 30–40
pips away from the current price. The underlying principle you have to use is to
ﬁnd a point to place your stop where you would no longer want to be in the trade
once the price reaches that level. Usually it falls at a point where the price goes
below support.
Aside from employing proper risk management strategies, one of the other
more crucial yet overlooked elements of successful trading is maintaining a healthy
psychological outlook. At the end of the day, a trader who is unable to cope with the
stress of market ﬂuctuations will not stand the test of time—no matter how skilled
they may be at the more scientiﬁc elements of trading. Here are some tips:
■Practice emotional detachment . That is, traders must make trading decisions based on
strategies independent of fear and greed. One of the premiere attributes a good
trader has is emotional detachment: While these traders are dedicated and fully
involved in their trades, they are not emotionally married to them; they accept
losing, and make their investment decisions on an intellectual level. Traders who
are emotionally involved in trading often make substantial errors, as they tend
to whimsically change their strategy after a few losing trades, or become overly
carefree after a few winning trades. A good trader must be emotionally balanced,
and must base all trading decisions on strategy—not fear or greed.
■Know when to take a break . In the midst of a losing streak, consider taking a break
from trading before fear and greed dominate your strategy.
Not every trade can be a winning one. As a result, traders must be psycholog-
ically capable of coping with losses. Most traders, even successful ones, will go
through a stretch of losing trades. The key to being a successful trader, though,
is being able to go through a losing stretch unfazed and undeterred. If you are
TRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS89experiencing a string of losing trades, it may be time to take a break from trading.
Often, taking a few days off from watching the market to clear your mind can be
the best remedy for a losing streak. Continuing to trade relentlessly during a tough
market condition can breed greater losses and ruin your psychological trading
capacity. Ultimately, it’s always better to acknowledge your losses rather than
continue to ﬁght through them and pretend they don’t exist. Make no mistake
about it: Regardless of how much you study, practice, or trade, there will be losing
trades throughout your entire career. The key is to make them small enough that
you can live to trade another day and allow your winning trades room to breathe
and ﬂourish. You can overcome a lot of bad luck with proper money management
techniques. This is why we have stressed a 2:1 reward to risk ratio, and why we
recommend not risking more than 2% of your equity on any single trade.
Whether you are trading forex, equities, or futures, there are 10 trading rules
that successful traders should live by:
1. Limit your losses.
2. Let your proﬁts run.
3. Keep position sizes within reason.
4. Know your risk versus reward ratio.
5. Be adequately capitalized.
6. Don’t ﬁght the trend.
7. Never add to losing positions.
8. Know market expectations.
9. Learn from your mistake—keep a trade log.
10. Have a maximum drawdown.

Technical Trading
Strategy: Multiple
Time Frame
Analysis
To trade successfully on an intraday basis, it is important to be selective. Trend
trading is one of the most popular strategies employed by global macro hedge
funds. Although many traders prefer to range trade, the big proﬁt potentials tend to
lie in trades that capture and participate in big market moves. It was once said by
Mark Boucher, a hedge fund manager of Midas Trust Fund and a former number-one
money manager as ranked by Nelson’s World Best Money Managers, that 70% of a
market’s moves occurs 20% of the time. This makes multiple time frame analysis
particularly important, because no trader wants to lose sight of the big picture. A
great comparison would be to imagine taking a road trip from Chicago to Florida.
There are going to be a lot of left and right turns along the way, but the most
important thing to be aware of during the trip is that you should be headed south.
The same approach should be taken in trading. Looking for opportunities to buy in
an uptrend or sell in a downtrend can be far much more proﬁtable than trying to
pick tops and bottoms.
The most common form of multiple time frame analysis is to use daily charts to
identify the overall trend and then use the hourly charts to determine speciﬁc entry
levels.
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS92
FIGURE 8.1 USDJPY Monthly Chart
Source: eSignal
Take a look at the USDJPY chart in Figure 8.1. This is a daily chart of the
U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen (USDJPY). As you can see, USDJPY has been
trending higher since late 2012. During this period, range or contrarian traders
looking to pick tops would have been faced with at least two years of difﬁcult and
most likely unproﬁtable trading—particularly when the currency pair was hitting
three- or four-year highs in late 2013 and early 2014. This area would have certainly
attracted a good deal of traders looking to pick a top or to fade the trend. Despite
a dip in mid-2013, USDJPY remained strong going into 2105, making life very
difﬁcult for medium-term range players.
Instead, the more effective trading str ategy would have been to take a position
in the direction of the trend. In USDJPY, this would have involved looking for
opportunities to buy on dips. Figure 8.2 shows one way to do so on a 15-minute
chart using the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Rather than looking for opportunities
to sell when RSI rose above 70, it was smarter to buy when it dipped to 30. The ﬁrst
horizontal line in Figure 8.2 shows the point at which RSI rose above 70. If you sold
at that level, USDJPY would have moved against you by 40 pips before reversing.
The second horizontal line shows the point at which RSI dipped to 30. If you bought
at that level, you would have picked the bottom on this short term USDJPY chart
for a move of at least 50 pips.
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS93
FIGURE 8.2 USDJPY 15-Minute Chart
Source: eSignal
Now let’s take a look at another example of the British pound. Figure 8.3
shows the monthly chart of the USDCAD from January 2013 to January 2015. Like
USDJPY, traders trying to pick tops in the USDCAD would have faced at least two
straight years of difﬁcult trading—particularly when the USDCAD was climbing
to fresh ﬁve-year highs in late 2014 early 2015. This level would have certainly
attracted a number of top pickers. To the frustration of those who tried to fade
the move, USDCAD rallied 9% beyond its ﬁve-year highs, which means those top
pickers would have incurred signiﬁcant losses. Taking a look at the hourly chart for
the USDCAD, we want to look for opportunities to buy on dips rather than sell on
rallies. Figure 8.4 shows Fibonacci retracement levels drawn from the 2002 to 2008
bear wave. Those levels held pretty well with declines ﬁnding support at the 38.2%
Fibonacci retracements between January 2008, Janua ry 2009, and January 2015.
Multiple time frame analysis can also be employed on a shorter-term basis. Let
us take a look at an example using CHFJPY. First we start with the hourly chart
of CHFJPY, shown in Figure 8.5. Using Fibonacci retracements, we can see on the
hourly charts that prices have failed at the 38.2% retracement of the December 30,
2004, to February 9, 2005, bear wave numerous times. This indicates that the
pair is contained within a weeklong downtrend below those levels. In this case,
we want to use our 15-minute charts to look for entry levels to participate in the
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS94
FIGURE 8.3 USDCAD Weekly Chart
Source: eSignal
overall downtrend. However, in order to increase the successfulness of this trade,
we want to make sure that CHFJPY is also in a downtrend on a daily basis. Taking
a look at Figure 8.6, we can see that CHFJPY is indeed trading below the 200-day
simple moving average, with the 20-day SMA crossing below the 100-day SMA. This
conﬁrms the bearish momentum in the currency pair. So as a day trader, we move to
the 15-minute chart to identify entry levels. Figure 8.7 is the 15-minute chart; the
horizontal line is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the earlier downtrend. We
see that CHFJPY broke above the horizontal line on May 11, 2005; however, rather
than buying into a potential breakout trade, the bearish big picture reﬂected on the
hourly and daily charts point to a contrarian trade. In fact, there were two instances
shown in Figure 8.7 where the currency pair broke above the Fibonacci level only
to trade signiﬁcantly lower. Disciplined day traders would use those opportunities
to fade the breakout.
The importance of multiple time frame analysis cannot be underestimated.
Looking at the big picture ﬁrst can help to keep traders out of a lot of dangerous
trades. The majority of new traders in the market are range traders for the simple
fact that buying at the low and selling at the high is an easy concept to grasp.

TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS99Of course, this strategy will work from time to time, but traders need to be
mindful of the overall trading environment if they want to be consistently proﬁtable.
Referencing back to Chapter 7, range traders should only try to play the trade
when the conditions for a range bound market are met. One useful way to identify
this type of market is to look for ADX to be less than 25 and ideally trending
downward.

101CHAPTER 9
Technical Strategy:
Trading with
Double Bollinger
Bands
One of the most useful technical indicators in my experience is Bollinger Bands.
Traditionally, Bollinger Bands are used as overbought and oversold indicators,
but given the trending nature of currencies, there are more efﬁcient ways to use the
bands. Traditionally, Bollinger Bands consists of three lines—the 20-period moving
average and the two standard deviation bands above and below the moving average.
If the currency pair rises to the upper Bollinger Band, it is considered overbought
because the move extended to an extreme level and should therefore be faded. The
same is true if it drops to the lower Bollinger Band. Unfortunately, currencies are
trending, and using the 20-period two standard deviation bands may not be the best
way to trade. Take a look at Figure 9.1. In this daily chart of EURUSD, the arrows
highlight the points where the currency pair ‘‘hugs’’ the second standard deviation
band. If you bought each time EURUSD touched the lower band or sold each time it
touched the upper band, there would be signiﬁcant losses before the currency pair
ﬁnally turned around.
The better technique would be to add another set of Bollinger Bands—the 20-
period, one-standard deviation. This would put four bands on the chart if the basis
TECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS102
FIGURE 9.1 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart
Source: eSignal
TECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS103or the 20-period moving average is removed, and most charting packages will allow
you to do that. Figure 9.2 shows how the same EURUSD daily chart with look with
two sets of Bollinger Bands. The outer lines are the two-standard-deviation Bollinger
Bands, and the two inner lines are the one-standard-deviation Bollinger Bands.
■Using Double Bollinger Bands to Pick Tops
and Bottoms
Having two sets of Bollinger Bands on your chart is a much more effective way
to pick a top or bottom in currencies. The general rule of thumb is that we don’t
buy a bottom until the currency pair has traded above the ﬁrst standard deviation
Bollinger Band. Along the same lines, we do not sell a top until the pair trades
below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. While this technique may not
pick the perfect bottom, it can help avoid prematurely picking a top or bottom
which can mean major losses in a trending environment. Here are the rules for the
long and short trades on a daily chart for picking tops and bottoms using the double
Bollinger Bands.
Strategy Rules for Long Trade
1. Look for the currency pair to be trading between the lower ﬁrst and second
standard deviation Bollinger Bands.
2. Look for a close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.
3. If so, BUY at close of candle or 5pm NY Time.
4. Stop 50 pips below ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.
5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to
initial entry price (breakeven).
6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.
Strategy Rules for Short Trade
1. Look for the currency pair to be tra ding between the upper ﬁrst and second
standard deviation Bollinger Bands.
2. Look for a close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.
3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.
4. Stop 30 pips above ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.
5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to
initial entry price (breakeven).
6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.
Lets take a look at the same EURUSD chart. Figure 9.3 shows the points at which
a trade would have been entered, and in most cases, it was a more effective way to
pick a top or bottom in the currency pair.

Now let’s take a look at some examples in more detail. In Figure 9.4, we see that
on May 18, the EURUSD, which had been trading between the two upper bands,
fell strongly to break out of the zone and close below the ﬁrst standard deviation
Bollinger Band. We sell at the NY close (there’s usually a leeway of two hours). A
two-lot trade is established at 1.1313 with a stop 30 pips above the ﬁrst standard
deviation Bollinger Band (1.1341) at 1.1371. The risk is 58 pips, which means that
the ﬁrst exit is 1.1313 minus 58 pips or 1.1255. The second proﬁt target is 1.1197,
which is two times risk or 116 pips. The ﬁrst and second proﬁt targets are reached
on the very next day when the currency pair drops to a low of 1.1119, for a proﬁt
of 58 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and another 116 pips on the second half. If
the stop was trailed using a moving average or percentage, a trader may have been
able to capitalize on th e selloff that ensued.
Figure 9.5 shows that on June 2, the EURUSD, which had been trading between
the two lower bands, rose strongly to break out of the zone and close ﬁrmly above
the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. We buy at the NY close (there’s usually
a leeway of two hours). A two-lot trade is e stablished at 1.1151, with a stop 30 pips
below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band (1.0970) at 1.0940. The risk is 211
pips, which means that the ﬁrst exit is 1.1151 plus 211 pips, or 1.1361. This proﬁt
target is reached two days later, when the currency pair races to a high of 1.1380.
At the time, the stop is moved to 1.1151, and the following day the breakeven stop

is hit, and we end up banking only +211 on the ﬁrst half of the trade with no losses

Using Double Bollinger Bands to Determine Trend versus Range
In addition to identifying levels to pick tops and bottoms, the double Bollinger Bands
can also be very helpful in determining the market environment. One of the most
commonly asked questions in forex is whether a currency pair is in trend or range.
When the pair is trading be tween the two lower or upper Bollinger Bands, it is in
trend, and when it is trading between the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Bands,
it is in range, as shown in Figure 9.6. When the currency pair is in trend mode,
it is best to look for opportunities to join the trend. When it is in the range zone,
picking tops and bottoms is preferred.
Using Double Bollinger Bands to Join a New Trend
Another way to use the double Bollinger Bands is to join a new uptrend or downtrend
using a daily chart. Here are the trading rules:
Strategy Rules for Long Trade
1. Look for the currency pair to close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger
Band.
2. Check to see if the last two candles were below the ﬁrst standard deviation
Bollinger Band.
3. If so, buyat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.
4. Initial stop at +65 pips.

4. Initial stop at +65 pips.
5. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price
(breakeven).
6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.
Here are some examples:
In Figure 9.7, we see that USDJPY closed above the ﬁrst standard deviation
Bollinger Band on May 18. We check to see if the last two candles were below the
band and the rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a long trade at 119.97. The
stop is placed 65 pips below at 119.32. The target for the ﬁrst half of the position is
50 pips, or 120.47, and the target for the second half is 195 pips, or 121.92. The
ﬁrst proﬁt target is reached 24 hours later (which is generally the case). When that
happens, the stop is raised to 119.97, which is the initial entry or breakeven price.
The trade is left on and the second proﬁt target of +195 pips is reached six trading
days after the trade was ﬁrst initiated.
In Figure 9.8, we see GBPUSD close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger
Band on March 4, so we check to see if the last two candles were above the band and
the rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a short trade at 5pm when the currency
pair is trading at 1.5263. The stop is placed 65 pips above at 1.5328. The target for
the ﬁrst half of the position is 50 pips, or 1.5213, and the target for the second half
is 195 pips, or 1.5068. The trade ﬂoats for 24 hours, then GBPUSD drops sharply,
hitting our ﬁrst and second proﬁt target on the very same day.
We encourage you to lay the Bollinger Bands on your charts and look for more
examples of these strategies in action. There are many ways to use the double
Bollinger Bands for forex trading. Both of these strategies are for daily charts, but
different strategies and rules can be used for intraday trading using the bands.
111CHAPTER 10
Technical Trading
Strategy: Fading
the Double Zeros
One of the most widely overlooked areas of trading is market structure.
Developing a keen understanding of market structure and its dynamics
can help day traders to gain an unbelievable advantage. Developing a feel and
understanding for market dynamics is key to proﬁtably taking advantage of short-
term ﬂuctuations. In foreign exchange trading this is especially critical as the primary
inﬂuence of intraday price action is order ﬂow. Given the fact that most individual
traders are not privy to sell-side bank order ﬂow, day traders looking to proﬁt from
short-term ﬂuctuations need to learn how to identify and anticipate price zones
where large order ﬂows should be triggered. This technique is very efﬁcient for
intraday traders as it allows them to get on the same side as the market maker.
When trading intraday, it is impossible to look for bounces off every support or
resistance level and expect to be proﬁtable. The key to successful intraday trading
requires more selectivity and only entering at those levels where a reaction is more
likely. Trading off psychologically important levels such as the double zeros or round
numbers is one good way of identifying such opportunities. Double zeros represent
numbers where the last two digits are zeros. Examples of double zeros would be
118.00in USDJPY or 1.11 00in the EURUSD. After noticing how many times a
currency pair would bounce off double zero support or resistance levels intraday
despite the underlying trend, we have observed that these bounces are usually much
larger and more relevant that rallies off other price levels. This type of reaction is
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS112perfect for intraday FX traders because it gives them the opportunity to make 30 to
50 pips while risking only 15–20 pips.
This trading technique is not difﬁcult, but it requires individual traders to develop
a solid feel for dealing room and market participant psychology. The idea behind this
double zero methodology is simple. Large banks with access to conditional order
ﬂow have a distinct advantage over other market participants. The bank’s order book
gives them direct insight into potential reactions at different price levels. Dealers
will often use this strategic information to put on short-term positions in their own
accounts.
Market participants as a whole tend to put conditional orders near or around
the same levels. While stop-loss orders are usually placed just beyond the round
numbers, traders will cluster their take proﬁt orders at the round number. The
reason why this occurs is because traders are humans, and humans tend to think in
round numbers. As a result, take proﬁt orders have a very high tendency of being
placed at the double zero level. Since the FX market is a 24-hour continuous market,
speculators also use stop and limit orders more frequently than in other markets.
Large banks with access to conditional order ﬂow, like stops and limits, actively seek
to exploit this clustering of positions to basically gun stops. The fading the double zero
strategy attempts to put traders on the same side as market makers by positioning
traders for a quick contra-trend move at the double zero level.
This trade is most proﬁtable when there are other technical indicators that will
conﬁrm the signiﬁcance of the double zero level. Here are some guidelines for fading
the double zeros or ‘‘round numbers.’’
■Strategy Rules
Long:
1. Identify a currency pair that is trading below its intraday 20-period simple
moving average on a 15-minute chart.
2. Enter a long position 10 to 15 pips above the ﬁgure.
3. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips below the ﬁgure.
a. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount risked, close half of the
position and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to
breakeven.
b. Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor.
Short:
1. Identify a currency pair that is trading above its intraday 20-period simple
moving average on a 15-minute chart.
2. Short the currency pair 10 to 15 pips below the ﬁgure.
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS1133. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips above the round number.
4. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount that you risked, close half of the
position and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to breakeven.
Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor.
Market Conditions
This strategy works best when the move happens in quieter market conditions
without the inﬂuence of major reports. It is more successful for currency pairs with
tighter trading ranges, crosses, and commodity currencies. This strategy also works
in the majors but under quieter market conditions since the stop loss is relatively
tight.
Further Optimization
Round numbers are important because they are signiﬁcant levels but if the price
coincides with a key technical level, a reversal becomes more likely. This means the
strategy has an even higher probability of success when other important support or
resistance levels converge at the ﬁgure. This can be caused by moving averages, key
Fibonacci levels or Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators.
Examples
Now let’s take a look at some of the examples of this strategy in action. The ﬁrst
example that we will go over is a 15-minute chart of USDJPY shown in Figure 10.1.
According to the rules of the strategy, we can see that on April 24, USDJPY was
trading above its 20-period moving. Prices continued to move higher with the
currency pair drifting toward 120.00, our double zero level. In accordance with the
rules, we place an entry order a few pips below the round number at 1110.85. Our
order is triggered, and we put our stop 20 above the ﬁgure at 120.20. USDJPY
climbs to a high of 120.08 before turning lower. We close half of the position when
it moves by the amount risked or 35 pips at 1110.50. Notice that USDJPY falls and
then rallies again before hitting our initial proﬁt target. When the ﬁrst proﬁt target
is reached, the stop on the remaining half of the position is moved to breakeven or
our initial entry price of 1110.85.
We then proceed to trail stop. The trailing stop can be done using a variety of
methods including a monetary or percentage basis. We choose to trail the stop by
two-bar low for a really short-term trade and end up getting out of the other half of
the position at 1110.50 as well, earning us 35 pips on the ﬁrst and second half of the
positions.
The next chart that we want to look at is GBPUSD. What’s interesting about
Figure 10.2 is that there are a number of examples. In the ﬁrst example, labeled ‘‘1,’’

FIGURE 10.1 USDJPY 15-Minute Chart
Source: eSignal
FIGURE 10.2 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart
Source: eSignal
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS115we can see that GBP/USD was trading above its 20-period moving average on a
15-minute chart and headed for 1.55. According to our rules, we place an order to
sell at 1.5485 (the high on this move was 1.5492) with a stop at 1.5520 for 35-pip
risk. GBPUSD moves in our favor, and our ﬁrst proﬁt target is hit at (1.5485 –.0035)
at 1.5450. We then move our stop to breakeven, or our initial entry price of 1.5485,
and proceed to trail it by the 20-day SMA +10 pips. If we manage our trade using
this type of trailing stop, the second half of the position would have been exited
at 1.5350 for 35 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and 135 pips on the second.
Part of the reason why this trade was so successful is because the 1.5500 is also
a signiﬁcant technical level. Example ‘‘2’’ is a long trail that reversed but not by
enough to hit the proﬁt target. Example ‘‘3’’ is a successful long trade that hit the ﬁrst
proﬁt target.
Making sure that the double zero level is a signiﬁcant level is a key element of
ﬁltering for good trades. The last example shown in Figure 10.3 is USDCAD on a
15-minute chart. The great thing about this trade is that it is triple zero level rather
than just a double zero level. Triple zero levels hold even more signiﬁcance than a
double zero level because of their less frequent occurrence. In Figure 10.3, we see
that USDCAD is also trading well below its 20-period moving average and heading
toward 1.2000. We look to go long 15 pips above the double zero level at 1.2015.
FIGURE 10.3 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart
Source: eSignal
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS116We place our stop 20 pips below the round number at 1.1980. The currency pair
hits a low of 1.2011 before moving higher. We then sell half of our positions when
the currency pair rallies by the amount that we risked at 1.2050. The stop on the
remaining half of the position is then moved to breakeven at 1.2015. We proceed
to trail the stop once again by the two-bar low and end up exiting the second half
of the position at 1.2055. As a result, we earned 35 pips on the ﬁrst position and
40 pips on the second position.
117CHAPTER 11
Technical Trading
Strategy: Waiting
for the Deal
The lack of volume data in the FX market has forced day traders to develop
different strategies that rely less on the level of demand and more on the micro
structure of the market. One of the most common characteristics that day traders
try to exploit is the market’s 24-hour round-the-clock nature. Although the market
is open for trading throughout the course of the day, the extent of market activity
during each trading session can vary signiﬁcantly. Traditionally, trading tends to be
the quietest during the Asian market hours as we indicated in Chapter 4. This means
that currencies such as the EURUSD and GBPUSD tend to trade within a very
tight range during these hours. According to the Bank of International Settlement’s
Triennial FX Survey published in September of 2014, the United Kingdom is the
most active trading center, capturing 41% of total volume. Adding in Germany,
France, Italy, and Switzerland, European trading as a whole accounts for 50% of
total FX trading. The United States, on the other hand, is only second to the
United Kingdom for the title of most active trading center, but that amounts to only
approximately 19% of total turnover. This makes the London open exceptionally
important because it gives the majority of traders in the market an opportunity
to take advantage of events or announcements that may have occurred during
late U.S. trading or overnight Asian sessions. This becomes even more critical on
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL118days when the FOMC meets to discuss and announce monetary policy because the
announcement occurs at 2:15pm NY Time, after the London close.
The British pound trades most actively against the U.S. dollar during the European
and London trading hours. There is also active trading during the U.S./European
overlap, but outside those time frames, the pair tends to trade relatively lightly
because the majority of GBPUSD trading is done through UK and European market
makers. This provides a great opportunity for day traders to capture the initial
directional intraday real move that occurs within the ﬁrst few hours of London
trading. This strategy exploits the common perception that UK traders are notorious
stop hunters. This means that the initial movement at the London open may not
always be the real one. Since UK and European dealers are the primary market
makers for the GBPUSD, they have tremendous insight into the extent of actual
supply and demand for the pair. The ‘‘waiting for the real deal’’ trading strategy
ﬁrst sets up when interbank dealing desks survey their books at the onset of trading
and use their client data to trigger close stops on both sides of the markets to gain
the pip differential. Once these stops are taken out and the books are cleared, the
real directional move in the GBPUSD will begin to occur, at which point we look
for the rules of this strategy to be met before entering into a long or short position.
This strategy works best following the U.S. open or after a major economic release.
With this strategy, you are looking for th e noise in the markets to settle before
trading the real trend of the day.
■Strategy Rules
Longs:
1. Early European trading in GBPUSD begins around 1am NY Time, and we look
for the pair to make new range low of at least 25 pips above the opening price
(the range is deﬁned as t he price action between the Frankfurt and London
power hour of 6 GMT to 7 GMT NY Time).
2. Look for the pair to reverse and penetrate the high.
3. Place an entry order to buy 10 pips above the high of the range.
4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range high, or 35
pips.
5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on
rest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.
Shorts:
1. GBPUSD opens in Europe and trades more than 25 pips above the high
established during the Frankfurt to London power hour.
2. Wait for the pair to reverse and penetrate the low.
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL1193. When that occurs, place an entry order to sell 10 pips below the low of the
range.
4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range low, or 35
pips.
5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on
rest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.
Examples
Now let’s take a look at some examples of this strategy in action. Figure 11.1 is
a textbook example of the ‘‘waiting for th e real deal’’ strategy. Between 6 and 7
GMT, the range high and low for GBPUSD are 1.5359 and 1.5234, respectively. At
the start of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upwards, taking
out the range high of 1.5359. At the time, we place an order to sell GBPUSD 10
pips below the range low at 1.5324. The entry is triggered about an hour and a half
later. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35 pips total) at
1.5359. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5274, or 50 pips below
the entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven
or 1.5324. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at 1.5219
shortly after the NY open.

TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL121The next example is shown in Figure 11.2. In this example, the range high and
low established between 6 and 7 GMT are 1 .5433 and 1.5399, resp ectively. At the
start of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upward, taking out
the range high of 1.5433 and racing all the way to 1.5492. At the time, we place an
order to sell GBPUSD 10 pips below the range low at 1.5389. The entry is triggered
around the NY open. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35
pips total) at 1.5424. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5339, or 50
pips below the entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to
breakeven or 1.5389. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at
1.5284 after the London open on the following trading day.
The third example is shown in Figure 11.3. In this example, the range during the
Frankfurt London power hour is 1.5187 and 1.5139. At the start of the London
trading session, GBPUSD drips lower, breaking below the range low and trading
down to 1.5105. When the range low is broken, we place an order to buy GBPUSD
10 pips below the range high at 1.5197. The entry is triggered around the NY open.
The protective stop is placed 25 pips below the range high (35 pips total) at 1.5172.
A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5247, or 50 pips below the entry
price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or 1.5197.
The second exit is not shown in the chart in Figure 11.3, but the breakeven stop is
triggered.

Technical Trading
Strategy: Inside
Days Breakout Play
Throughout this book, volatility trading has been discussed as one of the most
popular strategies employed by professional traders. There are many ways to
interpret changes in volatilities, but one of the simplest strategies is actually a visual
one that requires nothing more than a keen eye. Although this is a strategy that is
very popular in the world of professional trading, new traders are frequently amazed
by its ease, accuracy, and reliability. Breakout traders can identify inside days with
nothing more than a basic candlestick chart.
An inside day is deﬁned as a day where the daily range has been contained within
the prior day’s trading range, or in other words, the day’s high and low do not
exceed the previous day’s high and low. There needs to be at least two inside days
before the volatility play can be implemented. The more inside days, the higher the
likelihood of an upside surge in volatility, or a breakout. This type of strategy is best
employed on daily charts, but the longer the time frame, the more signiﬁcant the
breakout opportunity. Some traders use the inside day strategy on hourly charts,
which works to some success, but identifying inside days on daily charts tends to
lead to an even greater probability of success. For day traders looking for inside days
on hourly charts, chances of a solid breakout increases if the contraction precedes
the London or U.S. market opens. The key is to predict a valid breakout and not
get caught in a false breakout move. Traders using the daily charts could look for
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY124breakouts ahead of major economic releases for the speciﬁc currency pair. This
strategy works with all currencies pairs, but has less frequent instances of false
breakouts in the tighter range pairs such as the EURGBP, USDCAD, EURCHF,
EURCAD, and AUDCAD.
■Strategy Rules
Long:
1. Identify a currency pair where the daily range has been contained within the
prior day’s range for at least two days (we are looking for multiple inside days).
2. Buy 10 pips above the high of the previous inside day.
3. Place stop and reverse order for two lots at least 10 pips below the low of the
nearest inside day.
4. Take proﬁt when prices reach double the amount risked or begin to trail stop
at that level.
Protect against false breakouts : If the stop and reverse order is triggered, place a stop
at least 10 pips above the high of the nearest inside day and protect any proﬁts larger
than what you risked with a trailing stop.
Short:
1. Identify a currency pair where the daily range has been contained within the
prior day’s range for at least two days (we are looking for multiple inside days).
2. Sell 10 pips below the low of the previous inside day.
3. Place stop and reverse order for two lots at least 10 pips above the high of the
nearest inside day.
4. Take proﬁt when prices reach double the amount risked or begin to trail stop
at that level.
Protect against false breakouts : If the stop and reverse order is triggered, place a stop
at least 10 pips below the low of the nearest inside day and protect any proﬁts larger
than what you risked with a trailing stop.
Further Optimization
For higher-probability trades, technical formations can be used in conjunction with
the visual identiﬁcation to place a higher weight on a speciﬁc direction of the
breakout. For example, if the inside days are building and contracting toward the
top of a recent range such as a bullish ascending triangle formation, the breakout has
a higher likelihood of occurring to the upside. The opposite scenario is also true; if
inside days are building and contracting toward the bottom of a recent range and
we begin to see that a bearish descending triangle is forming, the breakout has a
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY125higher likelihood of occurring to the downside. Aside from triangles, other technical
factors that can be considered include signiﬁcant support and resistance levels. For
example, if there are signiﬁcant Fibonacci and moving average support zones resting
below the inside day levels, this either supports a higher likelihood of an upside
breakout or at least a higher probability of a false breakout to the downside.
Examples
Let us take a look at a few examples. Figure 12.1 is a daily chart of euro against the
British pound, or the EURGBP. The two inside days are identiﬁed on the chart, and
it is clear visually that each of those days’ ranges, which includes the high and low, is
contained within the previous day’s range. In accordance with our rules, we place
an order to go long 10 pips above the high on the previous inside at 0.6634 and an
order to sell 10 pips below the low of the previous inside day at 0.6579. Our long
order gets triggered two bars after the most recent inside day. We then proceed
to place a stop and reverse order 10 pips below the low of the most recent inside
day at 0.6579. So basically, we went long at 0.6634 with a stop at 0.6579, which
means that we are risking 45 pips. When prices reached our target level of double
the amount risked (90 pips), or 0.6724, we have two choices: to either close out the
entire trade or begin trailing the stop. More conservative traders should probably
square positions at this point, while more aggressive traders could look for more

proﬁt potential. We choose to close out the trade for a 90-pip proﬁt, but those who
stayed in and weathered a bit of volatility could have taken advantage of another 100
pips of proﬁts three weeks later.
Figure 12.2 is another example of inside day trading using the daily chart of
the New Zealand dollar against the U.S. dollar (or the NZDUSD). The difference
between this example and the previous one is that our stop and reverse order
actually gets triggered, indicating that the ﬁrst move was a false breakout. The two
inside days are labeled on the chart. In accordance with our rules, after identifying
the inside days, we place an order to buy on the break of the high of the previous
inside day and an order to sell on the break of the low of the previous inside day.
The high on the ﬁrst or previous inside day is 0.6628. This means we place an order
to go long at 0.6638 or to go short at 0.6618. Our long order gets triggered on
the ﬁrst day of the break at 0.6638, and we place a stop and reverse order 10 pips
below the low of most recent inside day (or the daily candle before the breakout),
which is 0.6560. However, instead of continuing the breakout, the pair reverses
and we close our ﬁrst position at 0.6560 with a 78 pips loss. We then enter into a
new short position with the reverse order at 0.6560. The new stop is then 10 pips
above the high of the most recent inside day at 0.6619. When NZDUSD moves by
double the initial amount risked, conservative traders can take proﬁt on the entire
position while aggressive traders can trail the stop using various methods that might
depend on how wide the trading range is. In this example, since the daily trading

range is fairly wide, we choose to close the position once the price reaches our limit
of 0.6404 for a proﬁt of 156 pips and a total proﬁt on the entire trade of 78 pips.
The last example uses technicals to help determine a directional bias of the inside
day breakout. Figure 12.3 is a daily chart of EURCAD. The inside days are once
again identiﬁed directly on the chart. The presence of higher lows suggests that the
breakout could very well be to the upside. Adding in the MACD histogram to the
bottom of the chart, we see that the histogram is also in positive territory right when
the inside days are forming. As such, we choose to opt for an upside breakout trade.
In accordance with the rules, we go long 10 pips above the high of the previous
inside day at 1.6008. Our long trade is triggered, and we place our stop and reverse
order 10 pips below the low of the most recent inside day at 1.5905. When prices
move by double the amount that we risked to 1.6208, we exit the entire position
for a 200-pip proﬁt.
With the inside day breakout strategy, the risk is generally pretty high if done
on daily charts, but the proﬁt potentials following the breakout are usually fairly
large as well. More aggressive traders can also trade more than one position, which
would allow them to lock in proﬁts on the ﬁrst half of the position when prices
move by double the amount risked and then trail the stop on the remaining position.
Generally these breakout trades are a precursor to big trends, and using trailing
stops would allow traders to participate in the trend move while also banking
some proﬁts.

129CHAPTER 13
Technical Trading
Strategy: Fader
More often than not, traders will ﬁnd themselves faced with a potential breakout
scenario, position for it, and then only end up seeing the trade fail miserably
and have prices revert back to range trading. In fact, even if prices manage to break
above a signiﬁcant level, a continuation move is not guaranteed. If this level is
very signiﬁcant, we frequently see interbank dealers or other traders try to push
prices beyond those levels momentarily in order to run stops. Breakout levels are
very signiﬁcant levels and for this very reason, there is no hard fast rule as to
how much force is needed to carry prices beyond levels into a sustainable trend.
Trading breakouts at key levels can involve a lot of risk and as a result, false
breakouts appear more frequently than real breakouts. Sometimes prices will test
the resistance level once, twice, or even three times before breaking out. This
has fostered the development of a large degree of contra-trend traders who look
only to fade breakouts in the currency markets. Yet fading every breakout can also
result in some signiﬁcant losses because once a real breakout occurs, the trend is
generally strong and long-lasting. So what this boils down to is that traders need a
methodology for screening out consolidation patterns for trades that have a higher
potential of resulting in a false breakout. The following rules provide a good basis
for screening such trades. The fader strate gy is a variation of the ‘‘waiting for the
real deal’’ strategy. It uses the daily charts to identify the range-bound environment
and the hourly charts to pinpoint entry levels.
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADER130■Strategy Rules
Longs:
1. Locate a currency pair whose 14-day ADX is less than 20. Ideally, the ADX
should also be trending downward, indicating that the trend is weakening
further
2. Wait for the market to break below the previous day’s low by at least 15 pips.
3. Place an entry order to buy a few ticks above the previous day’s high.
4. After getting ﬁlled, place your initial stop no more than 20 pips away.
5. Take proﬁt on half of position when prices increase by the amount you risked;
move stop on remaining position to breakeven.
6. Trail the stop on the remaining position.
Shorts:
1. Locate a currency pair whose 14-day ADX is less than 20. Ideally the ADX
should also be trending downward, indicating that the trend is weakening

2. Look for a move above the previous day’s high by at least 15 pips.
3. Place an entry order to sell a few ticks below the previous day’s low.
4. Once ﬁlled, place the initial protective stop no more than 20-pips below your
entry.
5. Protect any proﬁts by selling half of the position when it runs 20 pips in your
favor.
6. Place a trailing stop on the remainder of the position.
Examples
Let’s start by taking a look at an example to the short side. Figure 13.1 shows a
daily chart of USDJPY with the ADX below 20 and pointing downward. This is the
ﬁrst signal that a trade setup is in place. In this example, the previous day’s high
is 120.27. We ﬁrst look for a move above the previous day’s high by at least 15
pips, or 120.42. As shown in Figure 13.2 the hourly chart, that move occurs at the
start of the European session after which we place an order to sell 5 pips below the
previous day’s low of 120.00. The order is ﬁlled a few hours later at 119.95. At the
time, we place our stop at 120.15 and a ﬁrst target of 119.75. The ﬁrst target is
reached, and the stop on the rest of the position is moved to breakeven or 119.95.
In this example, the second half of the trade remains live and will either be closed at
breakeven, or the stop will be trailed.
Now let’s take a look at an example to the long side. Figure 13.3 shows a daily
chart of EURUSD with the ADX below 20 and pointing downward. This is the
ﬁrst signal that a trade setup is in place. In this example, the previous day’s high is

TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADER1331.0801, and the low is 1.0708. We see that the low is broken ﬁrst, and when that
happens we place an order to buy 5 pips above the previous days high at 1.0806.
As shown in Figure 13.4, the order is triggered about 7 hours later. At the time,
we place our stop at 1.0786 and a ﬁrst target of 1.0826. The ﬁrst target is reached
shortly after, and the stop on the rest of the position is moved to breakeven, or
1.0806. In this example, if we trail the stop on the position using a two-bar low, the
second half of the trade is closed at 1.0818.
Further Optimization
The false breakout strategy works best when there are no signiﬁcant economic
reports scheduled for release that could trigger sharp unexpected movements.
For example, prices often consolidate ahead of the U.S. nonfarm payrolls release.
Generally speaking, they are consolidating for a reason, and that reason is because
the market is undecided and is either positioned already or wants to wait to react
following that release. Either way, there is a higher likelihood that any breakout on
the back of those releases would be a real one and not one that you want to fade.
This strategy works best with currency pairs that are less volatile and have narrower
trading ranges.

135CHAPTER 14
Technical Trading
Strategy: 20-Day
Breakout Trade
Trading breakouts can be both a rewarding and frustrating endeavor as breakouts
have a tendency to fail. A major reason why this can occur frequently in the
foreign exchange market is because it is more technically driven than others and as a
result, there are many market participants who intentionally look to break pairs out
in order to ‘‘suck’’ in other nonsuspecting traders. In an effort to ﬁlter out potential
false breakouts, a price action screener should be used to identify breakouts that
have a higher probability of success. The rules behind this strategy are speciﬁcally
developed to take advantage of strong trending markets that make new highs that
then proceed to ‘‘fail’’ by taking out a recent low and then reverse again to make
another new high. This type of setup tends to have a very high success rate as it
allows traders to enter strong trending markets after weaker players have been
ﬂushed out, only to have real money players reenter the market and push the pair
up to new highs.
■Strategy Rules
Longs:
1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day high.
2. Look for the pair to reverse the same day or next to make a two-day low.
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE1363. Buy the pair if it takes out the 20-day high within three days of making the
two-day low.
4. Place the initial stop a few pips below the two-day low.
5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move
stop on rest to breakeven.
6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.
Shorts:
1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day low.
2. That day or the next the pair rallies to make a two-day high.
3. Sell the pair if it trades below the 20-day low within three days of making the
two-day high.
4. Risk up to a few ticks above the two-day high.
5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move
stop on rest to breakeven.
6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.
Examples
Now take a look at our ﬁrst example in Figure 14.1. The daily chart of GBPUSD
shows the currency pair making a new 20-day high on February 5. At this point,
the currency pair is on our radar, and we watch for a new two-day low to be made
FIGURE 14.1 GBPUSD Daily Chart
Source: eSignal
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE137within the next three days. This occurs right on schedule after which we wait for
the currency pair to make a new 20-day high, which occurs on February 12. At the
time, we buy GBPUSD a few pips above the previous 20-day high of 1.5352. We
enter at 1.5360. The stop is placed a few pips below the original two-day low of
1.5197 (or 1.5190). As the currency pair moves in our favor, we look to exit half
of the position when it moves by the amount that we risked, which is 155 pips or
1.5507. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or the
initial entry price of 1.5352. This rest of the trade is exited 24 hours later.
Figure 14.2 provides an example of how the strategy can work in the EURUSD
to the short side. On December 23, the currency pair makes a new 20-day low of
1.2165. It goes on radar and we start looking for the currency pair to rebound within
the next three days. The recovery occurs the following day, and a new two-day
high is made. Then we look for the previous 20-day low to be broken within the
following three days and that occurs shortly thereafter. At which point we enter
a short EURUSD trade at 1.2155 with a stop at 1.2260, or a few pips above the
two-day high of 1.2254. Our risk on the trade is 105 pips. When the currency pair
drops to 1.2050, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the
rest to breakeven. Then we trail the stop using a 2-bar high and end up exiting the
remainder of the position at 1.1846.
The ﬁnal example shown in Figure 14.3 is in AUDUSD. The currency starts by
making a new 20-day low on January 26. It goes on radar and we start looking
for the currency pair to rebound within the next three days. The recovery occurs
FIGURE 14.2 EURUSD Daily Chart

TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE138
FIGURE 14.3 AUDUSD Daily Chart

intraday, and a new two-day high is made right on schedule. Then we look for the
previous 20-day low to be broken within the following three days it occurs 24 hours
after the two-day high is made. At which point we enter a short AUDUSD trade a
few pips below the 20-day low at 0.7850 with a stop at 0.8032, or a few pips above
the two-day high of 0.8025. Our risk on the trade is 182 pips. When the currency
pair drops to 0.7668, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the
rest to breakeven. The breakeven stop is triggered the very same day that the ﬁrst
target is reached.
139CHAPTER 15
Technical Trading
Strategy: Channels
Channel trading is a less exotic but popular trading technique for currencies. The
reason why it can work is because currencies rarely spend much time in tight
trading ranges and have the tendency to develop strong trends. By reviewing a few
charts, traders can see that channels can easily be identiﬁed and occur frequently.
A common scenario would be channel trading during the Asian session and a
breakout in either the London or U.S. session. There are many instances where
economic releases are one of the most common triggers for a break of the channel.
Therefore, it is imperative that traders keep on top of economic releases. If a channel
has formed and a big U.S. number (per say) is expected to be released, and the
currency pair is at the top of a channel, the probability of a break is high, so traders
should be looking to buy the break out, not fade it.
Channels are created when we draw a trendline, and then draw a line that is
parallel to that trendline. Most if not all of the price activity of the currency pair
should fall between the two channel lines. We will seek to identify situations where
the price is trading within a narrow channel, and then trade in the direction of a
breakout from the channel. This strategy can be particularly effective when used
prior to a fundamental market event such as the release of major economic news, or
prior to the ‘‘open’’ of a major ﬁnancial market.
Here are some rules for using this technique to ﬁnd long trades:
1. First, identify a channel on either an intraday or daily chart. The price should
be contained within a narrow range.
2. Enter long as the price breaks above the upper channel line by 10 pips.
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS1403. Place a stop at the lower channel line.
4. Exit the position when it moves by double the amount risked.
The short rules are the reverse.
■Examples
Let examine a few examples. The ﬁrst example is a USDCAD 15-minute chart
shown in Figure 15.1. The total range of the channel is approximately 30 pips with
the low being 1.2028 and the high 1.2056. In accordance with our strategy, we
place entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at 1.2018 and 1.2066. The
order to buy gets triggered ﬁrst, and almost immediately we place a stop order
at the low of the channel or 1.2028, which means we are risking 38 pips on the
trade. USDCAD then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of double the range at
1.2142. More conservative traders could exit half of the position when it moves by
the amount risked, or 38 pips, and trail the stop on the remainder of the position.
The next example shown in Figure 15.2 is a 15-minute chart of EURGBP. The
total range between the two lines is 12 p ips with the low being 0.7148 and the high
0.7160. In accordance with our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and
below the channel at 0.7138 and 0.7170. The order to buy gets triggered ﬁrst and
almost immediately we place a stop at the low of the channel or 0.7160 for 10-pip
risk. EURGBP then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of 20 pips or double
the amount risked.

Figure 15.3 is a 15-minute chart of the EURUSD. The total range during this
four-hour period is 18 pips with a high of 1.1206 and a low of 1.1188. In accordance
with our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at
1.1216 and 1.1178. The order to sell gets triggered ﬁrst and almost immediately,
we place a stop order at the channel high of 1.1206 for a risk of 28 pips. The
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS142EURUSD then proceeds to sell off signiﬁcantly but only makes it to a low of 1.1132
before stopping us out a few days later. We chose to show this example because it
explains why the more conservative approach of exiting half of the position when it
moves by the amount risk is more desirable, even though it has worse risk reward.
A move of 58 pips is sizable on an intraday basis and may be difﬁcult to achieve.
Whenever the risk is greater than 20 pips, it may be more prudent to exit half and
trail the stop.

Technical Trading
Strategy: Perfect
Order
Aperfect order in moving averages is deﬁned as a set of moving averages that
is in sequential order. For an uptrend, a perfect order would be a situation
in which the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) is at a higher price level than
the 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 50-day SMA. Meanwhile, the 100-day
SMA would be below the 50-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA would be below
the 100-day SMA. In a downtrend, the opposite is true, where the 200-day SMA is
at the highest level and the 10-day SMA is at the lowest level. Having the moving
averages stacked up in sequential order are generally a strong indicator of a trending
environment. Not only does it indicate that the momentum is on the side of trend,
but the moving averages also serve as multiple levels of support. To optimize the
perfect order strategy, traders should also look for ADX to be greater than 20 and
trending upward. This represents a strong trend. Entry and exit levels are difﬁcult
to determine with this strategy, but genera l l ys p e a k i n g ,w ew a n tt os t a yi nt h et r a d e
for as long as the perfect order remains in place and exit once the perfect order no
TECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER144longer holds. Perfect orders do not happen often, and the premise of this strategy is
to capture the perfect order when it ﬁrst happens.
The perfect order seeks to take advantage of a trending environment near the
beginning of the trend:
1. Look for a currency pair with moving averages in perfect order.
2. Look for ADX pointing upwards, ideally greater than 20.
3. Buy ﬁve candles after the initial formation of the perfect order (if it still
holds).
4. Initial stop is the low on the day of the initial crossover for longs and the high
for shorts.
5. Exit the position when the perfect order no longer holds.
■Examples
Figure 16.1 is a daily chart of the EURUSD. In August 2014, the moving averages
in the EURUSD formed a sequential perfect order. We check and see that ADX is
greater than 20, and we look to enter into a short trade ﬁve candles after the initial
formation at 1.3390. Our initial stop is placed at the August 8 high of 1.3432. The
pair continues to move lower in the days and weeks that follow, and we remain in
the trade until the moving averages are no longer in perfect and the 10-day SMA
moves above the 20-day SMA, which occurs on October 17 when EURUSD settles
the day at 1.2758. The total proﬁt on this trade is 632 pips. We risked 42 pips on
the trade.
The next example is USDSGD. In Figure 16.2, the perfect order forms on
November 6. We check and see that ADX is greater than 20, and we look to enter
into a long trade ﬁve candles after the initial formation at 1.2916. Our stop should
be at the November 6 low of 1.2911 but that is below our entry price so we put
our stop at the 20-day SMA of 1.2822. The pair continues to move higher in the
months that follow, and we remain in the trade until the moving averages are no
longer in perfect and the 10-day SMA moves below the 20-day SMA, which occurs
on March 27, when USD/SGD closes the day at 1.3685. The total move on this
trade is 770 pips for a risk of 89 pips.
Figure 16.3 shows a perfect-order formation on a daily chart in USDJPY. The
perfect order formed in October and when that occurred, we entered the trade
ﬁve days afterward at 116.20. Our stop was placed at 108.75, and we remained in
the trade until the 10-day SMA crossed below the 20-day SMA on December 19 at

The perfect order is a strategy that can be high proﬁt but low probability and
low frequency. This means there could be numerous stop outs before a long trend
emerges. Also, when the currency pair moves more than 250 to 300 pips in proﬁt,
you may want to consider taking proﬁt on part of the positions.

Fundamental
Trading Strategy:
Pairing Strong with
Weak
One of the best ways to approach currency trading on a fundamental basis
is to pair the strongest currency with the weakest. Of course ﬁnding that
pairing is rarely simple because it is not just about which countries are the strongest
or weakest right now but instead which ones will become strong or weak going
forward. Finding these currencies can also be challenging because we live in a global
economy where the health of one major economy will affect the outlook of another.
Yet buying a weak currency and selling a strong one unknowingly can be a big
mistake that translates into large losses, so it is extremely important for forex traders
to learn how to pair strong with weak to maximize returns. After doing so you can
use technical analysis to help identify points of entry in the direction of the trend.
In 2015, for example, the European Central Bank introduced quantitative easing
(QE) as a last ditch effort to boost inﬂation and stimulate growth. We know that
QE lowers interest rates and erodes the value of a currency but selling euros blindly
on March 9, 2015, when the central bank started buying bonds for the very ﬁrst
time, yielded only a short-lived decline in the currency. Instead it would have been
smarter to look for opportunities to sell the currency against a strong one on rallies.

FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK151One good candidate at the time was the British pound, which was beneﬁting from
economic improvements and had a central bank that was moving closer to raising
rates. Figure 17.1 shows how there was a lot of consolidation in EURGBP near
74 cents prior to the launch of Eurozone quantitative easing. This level proved to
be resistance when the pair rallied in late March. Traders could have sold them,
assuming that resistance would hold, or waited for the pair to revisit that level in
April and May.
Another way to pair strong with weak is to follow the direction of commodity
prices. Oil prices bottomed at $43.46 in early 2015, having traded above $100 a
barrel only 8 months earlier and started to turn higher in March. As a major oil
producer, Canada would stand to beneﬁt from stabilization in crude prices. At the
time U.S. policy makers were talking about raising interest rates, the Australian
dollar was beneﬁtting from improving domestic conditions, and sterling soared on
positive data and a victory by the incumbent during the 2015 general election.
Selling any of these currencies and buying the Canadian dollar would have been a
risky endeavor. Instead the best bet at th e time was to sell the New Zealand dollar
and buy the Canadian dollar or the NZDCAD pair because New Zealand reported
extremely weak labor data that prompted policy makers to talk about easing. As
you can see in Figure 17.2, NZDCAD started to turn lower just as oil prices moved
higher in March.

FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK152The best way to gauge strong versus weak is to monitor economic data surprises.
While the ECB was buying bonds and implementing quantitative easing, Eurozone
data started to improve and U.S. data started to weaken. The market had not
anticipated this shift in dynamic as they had been looking for weak Eurozone data to
reinforce QE and stronger U.S. data to push the Fed to tighten. This unexpected
change drove EURUSD sharply higher, and buying breakouts in April and May as
shown in Figure 17.3 would have been good bets.
153CHAPTER 18
Fundamental
Trading Strategy:
The Leveraged
Carry Trade
The leverage carry trade strategy is the quintessential global macro trade that
has long been one of the favorite strategies of hedge funds and investment
banks. On its most fundamental level, the carry trade strategy involves buying
a high-yielding currency and funding it with the sale of a low-yielding currency.
Aggressive speculators will leave the trade unhedged with the hope that the high
yielding currency will appreciate in value relative to the lower yielding currency,
allowing them to earn the interest rate differential on top of the capital appreciation.
More conservative investors may choose to hedge the exchange rate component,
earning only the interest rate differential. Although the differentials tend to be small,
usually 1 to 3 percent if the position is leveraged 5 to 10 times, the proﬁts from
interest rates alone can be substantial. Of course it is important to remember that
while leverage can magnify proﬁts, it can also exacerbate losses. Capital appreciation
generally occurs when a number of traders identify proﬁt opportunities and pile into
the same trade, driving up the value of the currency pair.
In foreign exchange trading, the carry trade is a popular way to take advantage
of the notion that money ﬂows in and out of different markets, driven by the law
of supply and demand: with markets offering higher rates of return on investment
FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE154attracting the most capital. Countries are no different—in the world of international
capital ﬂows, nations that offer the highest interest rates will generally attract more
investment creating greater demand for their currencies. This helps to fuel the
carry trade. The carry trade strategy is simple to master, but like all strategies,
it contains risk. Carry trades perf ormed extremely well between 2000 and 2007,
failed miserably between 2008 and 2009, and recovered between late 2012 into
2015. The chance of loss can be great if you do not understand how, why, and when
carry trades work best.
■How Do Carry Trades Work?
To understand carry trading, it is important to ﬁrst understand that currencies are
always traded in pairs, so taking a carry trade involves buying a currency that offers
a high interest rate and simultaneously selling a currency that offers a low interest
rate. Carry trades are proﬁtable when the exchange rate remains unchanged in
value and investors are able to earn the d ifference in interes t—or spread—between
the two currencies, or when it appreciates in value, allowing the investor to earn
the spread along with capital appreciation. If the exchange rate falls by more than
the spread on the interest rate, it becomes a net loss for the investor.
Let’s take a look at an example: Assume that the Australian dollar offers an
interest rate of 4.75%, while the Swiss franc offers an interest rate of 0.25%. To
execute the carry trade, an investor buys the Australian dollar and sells the Swiss
franc. In doing so, he or she can earn a proﬁt of 4.50% (2.75% in interest earned
minus 0.25% in interest paid), as long as the exchange rate between Australian
dollars and Swiss francs do not change. Figure 18.1 shows exactly how an investor
would execute the carry trade.

FIGURE 18.1 Leveraged Carry Trade Example
FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE155To summarize : A carry trade involves buying a currency that offers a high interest
rate while selling a currency that offers a low interest rate.
■Why Do Carry Trades Work?
Interest rates are very important: Carry trades work because of the constant
movement of capital into and out of different countries in search of the highest yield.
Interest rates are the main reason why some countries attract more investment
than others. There are three reasons why a country can pay a higher interest rate.
First, if a country’s economy is doing well (high growth, high productivity, low
unemployment, rising incomes, etc.), it will be able to offer those who invest in the
country a higher rate of return. Second, central banks can raise interest rates on fast
growing economies with rising inﬂation. Third, countries with high debt to GDP
ratios, low credit ratings, and/or inherent growth problems may also need to pay a
higher interest rate to attract investment.
Investors prefer to earn higher interest rates: Investors who are interested in
maximizing their proﬁts will naturally look for investments that offer them the
highest rate of return. When making a decision to invest in a particular currency, an
investor is more likely to choose one that offers the highest rate of return, or in this
case, interest rate. If several investors make this exact same decision, the country
will experience an inﬂow of capital from those seeking to earn a high rate of return,
and the currency should appreciate.
What about countries that are not doing well economically? Countries that have
low growth and low productivity will not be able to offer investors a high rate of
return unless they have a very poor credit rating and are forced to offer a higher
rate to compensate for the risk of holding the country’s bond or currency. With
major economies, however, there will be times where growth is so weak that
interest rates are brought to zero, providing investors with no meaningful return.
The difference between countries that offer h igh interest rates versus countries that
offer low interest rates is what makes carry trades possible.
Let’s take another look at the carry trade example above in more detail.
Imagine an investor in Switzerland who is earning an interest rate of 0.25% per
year on her bank deposit in Swiss francs. At the time, a bank in Australia is offering
4.75% per year on a deposit of Australian dollars. Seeing that interest rates are much
higher with the Australian bank, this in vestor would like to ﬁnd a way to earn this
higher rate of interest on her money.
Now imagine that the investor could somehow trade her deposit of Swiss francs
by paying 0.25% for a deposit of Australian dollars paying 4.75%. What she has
effectively done is to ‘‘sell’’ her Swiss franc deposit and use those funds to ‘‘buy’’ an
Australian dollar deposit. With this transaction, she now owns an Australian dollar

deposit that pays her 4.75% in interest per year, 4.50% more than she was earning
with her Swiss franc deposit.
This investor has essentially just done a carry trade by ‘‘buying’’ an Australian
dollar deposit, and ‘‘selling’’ a Swiss franc deposit.
The net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows out of
Switzerland and into Australia, as investors take their Swiss francs and convert them
into Australian dollars. Australia attracts more capital because of the higher rates it
offers. This inﬂow of capital increases the value of the currency (see Figure 18.2).
To summarize : Carry trades are made possible by the differences in interest rates
between countries. B ecause they prefer to ea rn higher interest ra tes, investors will
look to buy and hold high interest rate paying currencies.
■When Will Carry Trades Work Best?
There will be times when carry trades work better than others. In fact, carry trades
are the most proﬁtable when there is a very speciﬁc attitude toward risk.
■How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take?
The moods of people in general change over time—sometimes they may feel more
daring and willing to take chances; other times they may be more timid and prone to
conservativeness. Investors, as a group, are no different. Sometimes they are willing
to make investments that involve a good amount of risk; other times they are more
fearful of losses and look to invest in safer assets.
In ﬁnancial jargon, when investors as a whole are willing to take on risk, we
call this low risk aversion, which means they are in risk-seeking mode. Alternatively,
when investors are drawn to more conservative investments and less willing to take
o nr i s k ,w ed e s c r i b et h e ma s risk-averse .
Carry trades are the most proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion .T h i s
notion makes sense when you consider what a carry trade involves. Remember, a
FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE157carry trade involves buying a currency that pays a high interest rate while selling a
currency that pays a low interest rate. In buying the high interest rate currency, the
investor is taking a risk because it is believed that a country needs to offer a higher
interest rate to offset the risk of holding th e currency. Also, while high interest rates
attract investment, they can also hurt growth by raising the cost of borrowing. This
creates uncertainty around whether the economy of the country will continue to
perform well and be able to pay not just high but even higher interest rates. This
risk is something a carry trade investor must be willing to take.
If investors as a whole were not willing to take on this risk, then capital would
never move from one country to another, and the carry trade opportunity would
not exist. Therefore, in order to return, carry trades require that investors as a
group have low risk aversion, or be willing to bear the risk of investing in the higher
interest rate currency.
To summarize : Carry trades will be the most proﬁtable when investors are willing
to bear the risk of investing in high interest paying currencies.
■When Will Carry Trades Not Work?
So far, we have shown that a carry trade will work best when investors have low
risk aversion. What happens when investors have high risk aversion ?
Carry trades are the least proﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion .W h e n
investors have high risk aversion, they are less willing as a group to take chances
with their investments. This means they would be less willing to invest in riskier
currencies that offer higher interest rates. Instead, when investors have high risk
aversion they would actually prefer to put their money in ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies
that pay lower interest rates. During this time, they may also opt to close or unwind
their carry trades. In doing so, they would be buying the currency with the low
interest rate and selling the curre ncy with the high interest rate.
Returning to our earlier example, let’s assume the investor suddenly feels
uncomfortable holding the foreign currency, the Australian dollar. Now, instead of
looking for the higher interest rate, she is more interested in keeping her investment
safe. As a result, she swaps her Australian dollars for more familiar Swiss francs.
The net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows
out of Australia and into Switzerland as investors take their Australian dollars and
convert them into Swiss francs. During this period of risk aversion, Switzerland
attracts more capital due to the perceived safety of its currency, and the inﬂow of
capital increases the value of the Swiss franc (see Figure18.3).
When investors have high risk aversion, they prefer to avoid the riskier high
interest rate paying currency and instea d invest in the safer, lower interest rate
paying currency, which is the opposite of a carry trade.

FIGURE 18.3 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 2
To summarize : Carry trades will be the least proﬁtable in periods of uncertainty
when investors are unwilling to bear the risk of investing in high interest paying
currencies.
■The Importance of Risk Aversion
Carry trades will generally be proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion, and
unproﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion. So before placing a carry trade
it is important to understand the risk environment—whether investors as a whole
have high or low risk aversion—and when it changes .
Rising risk aversion is generally beneﬁcial for low interest rate paying currencies:
Sometimes the mood of investors will change rapidly, and investors’ willingness
to make risky trades can change dramatically from one moment to the next.
Often, these large shifts are caused by signiﬁcant global events. When periods
of risk aversion occur quickly, the result is generally a large capital inﬂow into
low-interest-rate-paying ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies (see Figure 18.2).
For example, in the summer of 1998 the Japanese yen appreciated against the
dollar by more than 20% over the span of two months, due to the Russian debt
crisis and LTCM hedge fund bailout. Similarly, just after the September 11 terrorist
attacks the Swiss franc rose by more than 7% against the dollar over a 10-day period.
During the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, we also saw big gains in the yen and the
Swiss franc.
These sharp movements in currency values often occur when risk aversion quickly
changes from low to high. As a result, when risk aversion shifts, a carry trade can
turn from being proﬁtable to unproﬁtable very quickly.
Risk Aversion and Carry Trade Proﬁtability
As investor risk aversion goes from high to low, carry trades become more proﬁtable
as detailed in Figure 18.4.
How do you know if investors as a whole have high or low risk aversion?
Unfortunately, it is difﬁcult to measure investor risk aversion with a single number.

FIGURE 18.4 Carry Trade Proﬁtability
One way to get a broad idea of risk aversion levels is to look at bond yields. The
wider the spread between the yields of bonds from different countries with similar
credit ratings, the higher the investor risk aversion. Bond yields are readily available
on major ﬁnancial websites such as Bloomberg.com and Reuters.com. In addition,
several large banks have developed their own measures of risk aversion that signal
when investors are willing to take risk and when they are not.
Other Things to Bear in Mind When Considering a Carry Trade
While risk aversion is one of the most important things to consider before making
a carry trade, it is not the only one. The following are some additional issues to be
aware of.
Low Interest Rate Currency Appreciation
By entering into a carry trade, an investor is able to earn a proﬁt from the interest
rate difference, or spread, between a high interest rate currency and a low interest
rate currency. However, the carry trade can turn unproﬁtable if for some reason
(like the risk aversion examples earlier), the low interest rate currency appreciates
by a signiﬁcant amount.
Aside from rising risk aversion, improving economic conditions within a low
interest paying country can also cause its currency to appreciate. An ideal carry trade
will involve a low interest currency whose economy is weak and has low expectations
for growth. If the economy were to improve, however, the country might then be
able to offer investors a higher rate of return through increased interest rates. If this
were to occur—again, using the previous example, say that Switzerland increased
the interest rates it offered—then investors may take advantage of these higher rates
by investing in Swiss francs. As seen in Figure 18.3, an appreciation of the Swiss franc
FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE160would negatively affect the proﬁtability of the Australian dollar–Swiss franc carry
trade. (At the very least, higher interest rates in Switzerland would negatively affect
the carry trade’s proﬁtability by lowering the interest rate spread.)
This same sequence of events may currently be unfolding for the Japanese yen.
Given its zero interest rates, the Jap anese yen has for a very long time been an
ideal low interest rate currency to use in carry trades (known as yen carry trades ).
This situation however, may be changing. Increased optimism about the Japanese
economy has recently led to an increase in the Japanese stock market. Increased
investor demand for Japanese stocks and currency has caused the yen to appreciate,
and this yen appreciation negatively affects the proﬁtability of carry trades like
Australian dollar (high interest rate) versus Japanese yen.
If investors continue to buy the yen, the yen carry trade could start to become
unproﬁtable. This further illustrates the fact that when the low interest rate currency
in a carry trade (the currency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the
proﬁtability of the overall carry trade position.
Trade Balances
A country’s trade balance (the differen ce between imports and exports) can also
affect the proﬁtability of a carry trade. We know that when investors have low
risk aversion or are risk seeking, capital will ﬂow from the low interest rate paying
currency to the high interest rate paying currency (see Figure 18.2) but this does
not always happen.
One reason is because countries with large trade surplus can still see their
currencies appreciate in low risk environments because running a trade surplus
means that the country exports more than it imports. This creates naturally demand
for the currency.
The point of this example is to show that even when investors have low risk
aversion, large trade imbalances can cause a low interest rate currency to appreciate
(as in Figure 18.3). And when the low interest rate currency in a carry trade (the
currency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the proﬁtability of the carry
trade.
Time Horizon
In general, a carry trade is a long-term strategy. Before entering into a carry trade,
an investor should be willing to commit to a time-horizon of at least six months. This
commitment helps to make sure that the trade will not be affected by the ‘‘noise’’
of shorter-term currency price movements.
To summarize : Carry trade investors should be aware of factors such as currency
appreciation, trade balances, and time horizon before placing a trade. Any or all of
these factors can cause a seemingly proﬁtable carry trade to become unproﬁtable.

Fundamental
Trading Strategy:
Macro Event Driven
Trade
Short-term traders are generally focused only on the economic release of the
week and how it will impact their day trading activities. This works well for
many traders, but it is also important not to lose sight of the big macro events
that may be brewing in the economy or the world for that matter. Large-scale
macroeconomic events will move markets and will move them in very big ways.
Their impact goes beyond a simple one- or two-day price change because depending
on their size and scope, these occurrences have the potential to reshape the
fundamental perception toward a currency for months or even years at a time.
Events such as wars, political uncertainly, natural disasters, and major international
meetings or monetary policy changes are so potent due to their irregularity that they
can have widespread psychological and physical impacts on the currency market.
With these events come both currencies that appreciate vastly and currencies that
depreciate just as dramatically. Therefore, keeping on top of global developments,
understanding the underlying direction of market sentiment before and after these
events occur and anticipating them could be very proﬁtable, or at least can help
prevent signiﬁcant losses.

■Presidential elections
■Important summits

■Potential changes to currency regimes
■Possible debt defaults by large countries
■Possible wars as a result of rising geopolitical tensions
■Federal Reserve chairman’s semiannual testimony on economy
The best way to highlight the signiﬁcance of these events is look at a few notable
macroeconomic examples from the past two decades.
2014 Ukraine–Russia Crisis
The 2014 Ukraine–Russia crisis was one of the biggest geopolitical events of the
past decade. The crisis began in 2013 but didn’t really hit its peak until March
2014 when Russia signed a bill to absorb Crimea. Leading up to the announcement,
the uncertainty put signiﬁcant pressure on the EURUSD in January 2014 with the
currency pair dropping sharply on March 18, 2014, the day that Russia declared that
Crimea was now ofﬁcially apart of their country. This led to a few more weeks of
downward pressure for the EURUSD as shown in Figure 19.1 as investors awaited
the world’s response. Many nations declared their support for Ukraine and war was
feared, but eventually Russia was only hit with sanctions, and a few months later,
the Ukraine crisis moved to the back burner.
European Sovereign Debt Crisis (2009–2013)
The European Sovereign Debt Crisis started in 2009 and lasted into 2013 with the bulk
of the damage being done by February 2012. It was a multiyear debt crisis that was
sparked by the inability of many member nations to meet their debt obligations after
the global ﬁnancial crisis. Their banking sectors and economies suffered signiﬁcant
losses, and persistently negative growth prospects made it impossible for countries
such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus to repay or reﬁnance their government
debt. Between 2010 and 2012, all of these na tions required bailouts or some form
of support from the Troika, composed of the ECB, IMF and European Commission.
While the problems were concentrated in smaller Eurozone nations, there was fear

of contagion for the major economies. The country of Spain did not require a bailout
but in 2012, a number of banks required additional funding. The crisis posed caused
signiﬁcant volatility for the euro. Figure 19.2 shows two long periods of EURUSD
weakness that were caused by bailouts, downgrades, and other negative headlines.
Global Financial Crisis (2007–2009), Subprime
One of the most important macroeconomic events of the twenty-ﬁrst century was
the 2007 to 2009 subprime/global ﬁnancial crisis. It was triggered by a sharp slide
in house prices, default on mortgages, and blowup of subprime mortgage backed
securities and collateralized debt obligations. This, in turn, caused massive losses for
banks and ﬁnancial institutions, leading the failure of major ﬁrms such as Lehman
Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns. The impact on the ﬁnancial market and
the economy was staggering, with many countries falling into recession. During this
period, the stock market lost more than 50% of its value with the S&P 500, falling
from a high of 1,565 in October 2007 to a low of 676 in March 2009. As shown in
Figure 19.3, USDJPY dropped from a high of 116.47 in October 2007 to a low of
87.13 in January 2009. This was only the beginning of a multiyear decline for the
currency pair. EURUSD had a delayed reaction, rallying strongly between October
2007 and April 2008 as money ﬂowed out of the U.S. economy, and then falling
sharply between July 2008 and October 2008 as the risk aversion and crisis spread
to Europe.

Political Uncertainty: 2004 U.S. Presidential Election
Another example of major events impacting the currency market is the 2004 U.S.
presidential elections. In general, political instability causes perceived weakness
in currencies. The hotly contested presidential election in November of 2004,
combined with the differences in the candidates’ stance on the growing budget
deﬁcit, resulted in overall dollar bearishness. The sentiment was exacerbated even
further, given the lack of international support for the incumbent President (Bush)
due to the administration’s decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein. As a result, in
the three weeks leading up to the election, the euro rose 600 pips against the U.S.
dollar. This can be seen in Figure 19.4. With a Bush victory becoming increasingly
clear and later conﬁrmed, the dollar sold off against the majors as the market looked
ahead to what would probably end up being the maintenance of status quo. On the
day following the election, the EURUSD rose another 200 pips and then continued
to rise an additional 700 pips before peaking out six weeks later. This entire move
took place over the course of two months, which may seem like an eternity for
many, but this macroeconomic event really shaped the markets and for those who
were following it, big proﬁts could have been made. However, this is important
even for short-term traders because given that the market was bearish dollars in
general leading up to the U.S. presidential election, a more prudent trade would be
to look for opportunities to buy the EURUSD on dips rather than trying sell rallies
and look for tops.

G7 Meeting Dubai September 2003
The G7 ﬁnance ministers meeting on September 22, 2003, was a very important
turning point for the markets. The dollar collapsed signiﬁcantly following the meeting
at which the G7 ﬁnance ministers wanted to see ‘‘more ﬂexibility in exchange rates.’’
Despite the rather tame nature of these words, the market interpreted this line to be
a major shift in policy. The last time changes to this degree had been made was back in
2000. Taking a step back, the countries that constitute the G7 are the United States,
United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, and France. Collectively, these
countries account for two-thirds of the world’s total economic output. Not all G7
meetings are important. The only time the market really hones in on the G7 ﬁnance
ministers meeting is when they expect big changes to be made to the statement. In
2000, the market paid particular attention to the upcoming meeting because there
was strong intervention in the EURUSD the day before the meeting. The meeting
in September 2003 was also important because the U.S. trade deﬁcit was ballooning
and becoming a huge issue. The EURUSD bore the brunt of the dollar depreciation
while Japan and China were intervening aggressively in their currencies. As a result,
it was widely expected that the G7 ﬁnance ministers as a whole would issue a
statement that was highly critical of Japan and China’s intervention policies. Leading
up to the meeting, the U.S. dollar had alre ady begun to sell off as indicated by the
chart. At the time of the announcement, the EURUSD shot up 150 pips. Though
this initial move was not ve ry substantial, between Se ptember 2003 and February

2004 (which was the next G7 meeting), the dollar fell 8% on a trade-weighted
basis, 9% against the British pound, 11% against the euro, 7% against the yen,
and 1.5% against the Canadian dollar. To put the percentages into perspective, a
move of 11% is equivalent to approximately 1100 pips. Therefore, the longer-term
impact is much more signiﬁcant than the immediate impact as the event itself has the
signiﬁcance to change the overall sentiment in the market. Figure 19.5 is a weekly
chart of the EURUSD that illustrates how the currency pair performed following
the September 22, 2003 G7 meeting.
U.S. War Against Iraq
Geopolitical risks such as wars can also have a pronounced impact on the currency
market. Figure 19.6 shows that bet ween December 2002 and February 2003, the
dollar depreciated 9% against the Swiss franc (USDCHF) in the months leading up
to war. The dollar sold off because the war itself was incredibly unpopular among
the international community. The Swiss franc was one of the primary beneﬁciaries
due to the country’s political neutrality an d safe-haven status. Between February
and March, traders began to believe that the inevitable war would turn into a quick
and decisive U.S. victory, so they began to unwind the war trade. This eventually
led to a 3% rally in USDCHF as investors exited their short dollar positions.
Each of these events caused large-scale movements in the currency market. Such
events are clearly important to follow for all types of traders. Keeping abreast of
FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE168
FIGURE 19.6 USDCHF Iraq War

broad macroeconomic events can help traders make smarter decisions and prevent
them from fading large factors that may be brewing in the background. Most of
these events are talked about, debated, and anticipated many months in advance by
economists, currency analysts, and the international community in general.
169CHAPTER 20
Quantitative Easing
and Its Impact on
Forex
Quantitative easing is such an important topic that it deserves its own chapter.
After the global ﬁnancial crisis many countries fell into recession, and in
response central banks around the world lowered interest rates to record lows.
When rates could not fall any lower, they had to resort to unprecedented measures,
the most powerful of which was quantit ative easing (QE). Between 2007 and 2015,
the Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and
the Swedish National Bank all resorted to QE, and their decision had a signiﬁcant
impact on their currencies on both a short- and long-term basis.
The goal of quantitative easing is to keep yields low and to ﬂood the market
with liquidity. To do so, a central bank would create money by buying ﬁnancial
assets such as government bonds from banks using electronic cash. This basically
‘‘creates new money.’’ It also keeps yields low because bond prices have an inverse
relationship with yields and in giving banks money, the hope is that it will encourage
lending and in turn lead to more economic activity. The jury is out on how
much QE really helped these economies, but the inﬂuence on currencies was
undeniable.
QUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX170■U.S. Quantitative Easing
After the ﬁnancial crisis, the ﬁrst major central bank to respond with quantitative
easing was the U.S. Federal Reserve. In November 2008, the central bank launched
a $600 billion bond-buying program. The program was initially effective as the
economy improved, prompting the Fed to temporarily halt bond purchases.
However, the economy never gained additional momentum and as such, the central
bank returned with a second round of QE (dubbed QE2) in November 2010. The
size of the program matched the ﬁrst round. Unfortunately, more bond buys were
needed, and QE3 was launched in September 2012. Unlike QE1 and QE2, QE3
was an open-ended program. The central bank announced plans to purchase $40
billion in assets every month, and in December 2012, that amount was increased
to $85 billion per month. The program lasted for ﬁve years, and purchases were
ﬁnally halted in October 2014. Figure 20.1 shows how each round of quantitative
easing impacted the EURUSD. As you can see, each round triggered a sharp rise in
EURUSD and—another way to look at it—weakness in the U.S. dollar. In 2008,
the month that QE1 was announced, EURUSD surged 17% from high to low.
When QE2 was announced, the EURUSD began a rally that took the pair up more
than 20%. QE3 led to a similar uptrend with gains extended when the program
was increased.
■UK Quantitative Easing
Quantitative easing was launched by the Bank of England in March 2009. At the
time, the BoE pledged to spend 75 billion pounds over a three-month period buying
UK assets, but the program continue d and between March 2009 and January 2010,
the central bank had spent 200 billion pounds. In October 2011, growth started to
slow more dramatically with the economy facing a double dip recession. In response
policymakers voted to increase the QE program by another 75 billion. In February
2012, the central bank added another 50 billion and the same increase was made in
July 2012, bringing the total program to 375 billion pounds. Figure 20.2 shows how
GBPUSD responded to each round of QE. What is interesting is that the sterling
fell sharply in the run up to the March 2009 announcement. It extended lower
afterward but rebounded in the months that followed. In 2011, 2012, and 2013,
the sterling rallied the month that QE was announced. One important thing to
remember is that the Federal Reserve was also buying bonds and expanding its own
QE program at the time, so the two offset each other to some degree, limiting the
reaction in GBPUSD. More importantly, investors interpreted each round of BoE
QE as positive for the currency because they hoped that the central bank’s efforts
would help to turn around the economy.

QUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX175■Japan Quantitative Easing
The phrase quantitative easing was ﬁrst used by the Bank of Japan in 2001. At the time,
they did not believe that the program was effective but after the ﬁnancial crisis, they
said they would examine their asset purchase program. In October 2011 the Bank of
Japan increased the program by 5 trillion yen which was a small sum (approximately
USD$66 billion) compared to the staggering amounts that other countries were
purchasing. Then in April 2013, they announced a bold and aggressive plan to
buy 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen a year as part of Prime Minister Abe’s economic
policies. This program was later expanded to 80 billion yen a year. Unlike other
countries where the effectiveness of QE was debated, Japan’s bond buying program
played a large role in turning around the economy. It also had a signiﬁcant impact
on the currency. In Figure 20.3 we show how the ﬁrst program yielded a very small
response in USDJPY but when the Bank of Japan came out in size, USDJPY reacted
quickly and aggressively with a move that extended even further when the program
was expanded.
■Eurozone Quantitative Easing
The European Central Bank was the last major central bank to roll out quantitative
easing. They were reluctant to do so for a very long time because structurally the
Eurozone is not set up for quantitative easing. Since there is no euro-bond, some
critics felt that it was not in line with the central bank’s mandate. However faced
with sluggish growth, stubbornly low inﬂation, and an interest rate already at zero,
the ECB had very few options. They publicly discussed the option months before the
actual decision, giving the market plenty of opportunity to discount the move. In
January 2015, the ECB announced that they would spend 60 billion euros per month
buying private and public bonds. In March 2015, ECB President Draghi unveiled
an aggressive 1 trillion quantitative easing program. As shown in Figure 20.4, both
announcements had a signiﬁcant impact on the currency, but EURUSD stabilized
after the second announcement (but only after falling 500 pips) because investors
hoped that the aggressive program by the central bank would help turn around
the economy.
While no additional quantitative easing programs are expected as of mid-2015,
the unwinding of these unprecedented measures in the coming years should have
just as much impact on currencies as the initial announcement itself, providing an
opportunity for forex traders.

Fundamental
Trading Strategy:
Commodity Prices
as a Leading
Indicator
Commodities like gold and oil have an important connection to the FX market.
Understanding the nature of these relationship can help traders gauge risk,
forecast price changes, and understand exposure. Even if commodities are unfamiliar,
they will often move on the same fundamental factors as currencies, particularly
when it comes to popular instruments such as gold and oil. As discussed previously,
there are four major currencies that are considered commodity currencies : the Australian
dollar, the Canadian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, and the Swiss franc. However,
every one of these currencies is different, as are their correlation with commodities.
Take the Canadian dollar, for example; it tends to move in line with oil prices,
but the connection is complicated and ﬁckle. There are different reasons for why
these currencies mirror commodity prices in their movements; and knowledge of
FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY178the fundamental drivers behind these movements, their direction, and the strength
of their correlation can be an effective way to discover trends in both markets.
Let’s start with gold and oil because they have the largest inﬂuence on currencies.
■Gold
Before looking at the relationship that gold has with commodity currencies, it is
important to understand th e connection between gold and the U.S. dollar. The
United States is the world’s second largest producer of gold (behind South Africa),
but a rally in gold prices does not always lead to dollar appreciation. Actually, when
the dollar falls, gold prices tend to rise, and vice versa. This seemingly illogical
occurrence is a byproduct of the perception investor’s hold for gold. During periods
of geopolitical instability, traders tend to shy away from the dollar and turn to
the safety of gold. In fact, many traders coin gold as the anti-dollar . Therefore,
if the dollar depreciates, gold gets pushed up as wary investors ﬂock from the
declining greenback to the steady c ommodity. AUDUS D mirrors gold movements
most closely.
Between June 2010 and J une 2015, A UDUSD had a strong 0.83, or 83%,
positive correlation with gold as shown in Figure 21.1; so when gold prices rise,
the AUDUSD would generally appreciate as well. The relationship comes from the
fact that Australia is the world’s second largest producer of gold, exporting about
$5 billion worth of the precious metal annually. Because of this, the currency pair
ampliﬁes the affects of gold prices twofold. If instability is causing an increase in

FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY179prices, this probably signals that the USD has already began to depreciate. The
AUDUSD pair will then be pushed down fur ther as importers of gold demand more
of Australia’s currency to cover higher costs. Surprisingly enough the CADUSD
also had a 0.67 correlation with gold during the same period because Canada is the
world’s ﬁfth largest producer of gold and a risk currency. Thus, rising gold prices
could be a precursor to gains in AUD and sometimes even in the CAD.
In the past, there was a strong correlation between the Swiss franc and gold
because their reserves were backed by gold; but when the central bank abandoned the
gold standard, this relationship bro ke. Between 2010 and 2015, gold and CHFUSD
only had a 0.36, or 36%, positive correlation. Not everyone realizes how much the
relationship deteriorated because many still remember the days when both were
perceived as safe havens. The Swiss National Bank’s 1.20 EURCHF peg also eroded
the correlation between gold and the Swissie and it may be some time before this
correlation returns.
■Oil
Oil prices have a huge impact on the global economy, affecting both consumers
and producers. The correlation between this commodity and cu rrencies is far more
complex and less stable than gold. In fact, of all of the commodity currencies, only
one (the CAD) has any meaningful connection with oil prices.
The Canadian dollar is traditionally quoted as USDCAD but to examine the
correlation between the Canadian dollar and oil, we ﬁnd it more valuable to invert
the pair and talk about CADUSD. The co rrelation index between oil and CADUSD
is 0.67. The relationship has been stronger in the past but in recent years, the
performance of the U.S. economy also played a role in the market’s appetite for
U.S. dollars. On a day-to-day basis, oil may not have a signiﬁcant impact on the
CAD, but over the medium term, as shown in Figure 21.2, the relationship can be
strong, with oil acting as a leading indicator for the Canadian dollar. Canada is the
world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil, so the price of oil can have a signiﬁcant impact
on the country’s economy.
The price of oil also impacts global inﬂation. In 2014, oil prices dropped from
a high of $107 a barrel to $50 a barrel. This move caused inﬂation to fall across
the globe, prompting easing measures by major central banks and forcing the
European Central Bank to introduce quantitative easing in 2015. If oil prices decline
in a meaningful way, it generally leads to more expansionary monetary policies,
especially if it is driven by weaker growth and not offset by stronger demand.
In contrast, rising oil prices can create inﬂationary pressures, leading to tighter
monetary policy conditions. Therefore, the path of oil prices has implications for
not only the CAD but all major and minor currencies.

■Iron Ore and Dairy Prices
Iron ore and dairy prices can also inﬂuence the price action of commodity currencies.
Iron ore is Australia’s most important export, which means that a rise in iron ore
prices will boost corporate proﬁts and, in turn, the Australian dollar. Meanwhile,
a decline in iron ore prices will hurt the currency. Dairy prices can inﬂuence the
performance of the New Zealand dollar, because milk is the country’s number
one export.
■Trading Opportunity
Now that the relationships have been explained, there are two ways to exploit this
knowledge. Taking a look at Figures 21.1 and 21.2, you can see that commodity
prices are generally a leading indicator for currency prices. As such, commodity
bloc traders should monitor gold and oil prices to help determine where these
currencies are headed. The second way to exploit this knowledge is to trade the
same view using different products, which helps to diversify risk even when the
high correlation. In fact, there is one key advantage of expressing a gold/oil view
in currencies over commodities, and that is the opportunity to earn interest on the
positions, which is something trading gold or oil futures do not offer.
181CHAPTER 22
Fundamental
Strategy: Using
Bond Spreads
as a Leading
Indicator for FX
Any trader can attest that interest rates are an integral part of investment decisions
and can drive markets in either direction. FOMC rate decisions are the second
most market moving release for currencies, behind nonfarm payrolls. The effects
of interest rate changes have not only short-term implications, but also long-term
consequences on the currency markets. One central bank’s rate decision can affect
more than a single pairing in the network of currencies. Yield differentials of ﬁxed-
income instruments such as Libor rates and 10-year bond yields can be used as leading
indicators for currency movements. In FX trading, an interest rate differential is
the difference between the interest rate of a base currency (appearing ﬁrst in the
pair) less the interest rate of the quoted currency (appearing second in the pair).
Each day at 5pm EST, the close of the day for currency markets, funds are either
paid out or received to adjust for interest rate differences. This is known as rollover .
FUNDAMENTAL STRATEGY182Understanding the correlation between interest rate differentials and currency pairs
can be very useful particularly since it is the single most important driver of currency
movements. In addition to monetary policy decisions, the future direction of rates
along with the expected timing of rate changes is also critical to currency pair
movements. The reason why it is important is because the majority of international
investors are yield seekers. Large investment banks, hedge funds, and institutional
investors have the ability access the global markets and actively shift funds from
lower yielding assets to higher yielding assets.
■Calculating Interest Rate Differentials
and Following the Currency Pair Trends
The best way to use interest rate differentials for trading is by keeping track of
one-month LIBOR rates and/or 10-year bond yields in Microsoft Excel. These rates
are publicly available on websites such as Bloomberg.com. Interest rate differentials
are then calculated by subtracting the yield of the second currency in the pair from
the yield of the ﬁrst. It is important to make sure that interest rate differentials are
calculated in the order in which they appear for the pair. For instance, the interest
rate differentials in GBPUSD should be the 10-year gilt rate minus the U.S. 10-year
rate. For euro data, use data from the German 10-year bund. Form a table that looks
similar to the one shown in Figure 22.1.
After sufﬁcient data are gathered, you can chart the currency pair values versus
yields using a graph with two axes to see if there are any correlations or trends. The
date should be used as the x-axis and currency pair price and interest rate differentials
as the two y-axes. To fully utilize these data in trading, it is important to monitor
the trend of interest rates differentials because they can be used as a guide for the
future direction of the currency pair.

FIGURE 22.2 EURUSD and Bond Spread
To fully appreciate the correlation between interest rates and currencies, let’s
take a look at a few examples. Figure 22.2 charts the EURUSD against the 10-year
German bund and U.S. Treasury yield spread between June 2010 and June 2015. As
you can see, there is a very strong correlation between these instruments. However,
sometimes the currency pair will have a delayed reaction. For example, the yield
spread started to fall in early 2013, and while it led to consolidation in EURUSD,
the currency pair did not start to really trend lower until June 2014. Nonetheless,
it is clear from the chart that the relationship is strong.
Figure 22.3 shows the relationship between GBPUSD and the 10-year UK Gilt
and US Treasury yield spread. In this example, there was no delay in the reaction
of GBPUSD to the movement in yields. Th e yield spread started to fall quickly
between June 2014 and J une 2015, and it coincided with the decline in GBPUSD.
Figure 22.4 takes a look at a nondollar pai r, AUDNZD, and once again, we see a
very strong correlation. Th is chart compares the AUDNZD currency pair with the
10-year Australian and New Zealand yield spread. Sometimes, the interest rate yield
will lead the direction of AUDNZD, and other times, AUDNZD will be a leading
indicator for the spread.
■Interest Rate Differentials: Leading Indicator,
Coincident Indicator, or Lagging Indicator?
We know that yield spreads and currencies have a strong correlation, but do
currency pair prices predict interest rate movements, or do interest rate movements
drive currency pair prices? Leading indicators are economic indicators that predict

future events; coincident indicators are economic indicators that vary with economic
events; lagging indicators are economic indicators that follow an economic event.
For instance, if interest rate differentials predict future currency pair prices, interest
rate differentials are said to be leading indicators of currency pair prices. Whether
interest rate differentials are a leading, coincident, or lagging indicator of currency
pair prices depends on how much traders care about future rates versus current rates.
Assuming efﬁcient markets, if currency traders only care about current interest
rates and not about future rates, one would expect a coincident relationship. If
currency traders consider both current and future rates, one would expect interest
FUNDAMENTAL STRATEGY185rate differentials to be a leading indicator of currency prices. The rule of thumb is
that when there is a big move in the yield spread, it will coincide with a big move in
the currency pair; and if that hasn’t happen, then it signals an imminent move in the
pair. No correlation is perfect. There will be times when interest rate differentials
matter more than others and that tends to be when central banks are at the cusp of
or engaging in major monetary policy changes.

187CHAPTER 23
Fundamental
Trading Strategy:
Risk Reversals
Risk reversals are a useful fundamental-based tool to add to your mix of trading
indicators. One of the weaknesses of currency trading is the lack of volume data
and accurate indicators for gauging sentiment. The only publicly available report
on positioning is the Commitment of Traders Report published by the Commodity and
Futures Commission. Unfortunately, this report is released with a three-day delay.
A useful alternative is to use risk reversals—which are provided on a real-time basis
on the FXCM News Plugin , under options, or on the Bl oomberg/Reuters terminals.
As we ﬁrst introduced in Chapter 7, a risk reversal consists of a pair of options
for the same currency (a call and a put). Based on put–call parity, these far out of
the money options (25 delta) with the same expiration and strike price should also
have the same implied volatility. However, in reality, this is not true. Sentiment is
embedded in volatilities, which makes risk reversals a good tool to gauge market
sentiment. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates that there is more
demand for calls than puts. The opposite is also true; a number strongly in favor of
puts over calls indicates that there is a premium built in put options as a result of the
higher demand. If risk reversals are near zero, it indicates that there is indecision
among bulls and bears and that there is no strong bias in the markets.

FIGURE 23.1 EURUSD Risk Reversal Chart
■What Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?
We showed this table before in Chapter 7, but want to present it again to make
sure that it is understood well (see Figure 23.1). Each of the abbreviations for the
currency options are listed; and as indicated, most risk reversals are near zero,
which reﬂects no major bias for puts or calls. However, for USDJPY, the longer-
term risk reversals indicate that the market is strongly favoring yen calls (JC) and
dollar puts.
■How Can You Use This Information?
For easier graphing and tracking purposes, we use positive and negative integers
for calls and put premiums respectively. A positive number indicates that calls
are preferred over puts and that the market as a whole anticipates an upward
movement in the underlying currency. Likewise, a negative number indicates that
puts are preferred over calls and that the market is expecting a down-move in the
underlying currency. Used prudently, risk reversals can be a valuable tool in judging
market positioning. While the signals generated by a risk reversal system will not
be completely accurate, they can help investors judge whether the market is bullish
or bearish.
Risk reversals become particularly important when the values are at extreme
levels. We identify extreme levels as one standard deviation plus or minus the average
FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS189risk reversal. When risk reversals are at these levels, they give off contrarian signals,
indicating that a currency pair is overbought or oversold based upon sentiment.
The indicator is perceived as a contrarian signal because when the entire market
is positioned for a rise in a given currency, it makes it harder for the currency to
rally and easier for it to fall on negative news or events. As a result, a strongly
negative number implies oversold conditions whereas a strongly negative number
would imply overbought conditions. Although the buy or sell signals produced by
risk reversals are not perfect, they can convey additional information used to make
trading decisions.
Examples
Take a look at our ﬁrst example of the EURUSD (Figure 23.1). Visually, you can see
that 25 delta risk reversals have been a leading indicator for EURUSD price action.
When risk reversals plunged to –1.39 o n September 30, it was a signal that the
market had a strong bearish bias. This proved to be a reliable contrarian indicator
of what eventually became a 300-pip rebound in the EURUSD over the course of
nine days. When prices spiked once again almost immediately to 0.67 in favor of a
continuation of the up move, the EURUSD proved bulls wrong by engaging in an
even deeper selloff. Although there were many instances of risk reversals signaling
contra-trend moves on a smaller scale, the next major spike came a year later. On
August 16, risk reversals were at 1.43, which meant that bullish sentiment hit a
very high level. This preceded a 260-pip drop in the EURUSD over the course of
three weeks. When risk reve rsals spiked once again a month later to 1.90, we saw
another top in the EURUSD, which later became a much deeper descent.

do a very good job of identifying extreme overbought and oversold conditions. Buy
and sell levels are added to the GBPUSD chart for further clariﬁcation of how risk
reversals can also be used to time market turns. With the lack of price volume data
to give us a sense of where the market is positioned, risk reversals can be helpful in
gauging general market sentiment.

Fundamental
Trading Strategy:
Using Option
Volatilities to Time
Market Movements
Using option volatilities to time foreign exchange spot movement is a topic that
we touched on brieﬂy in Chapter 7. This strategy warrants a more detailed
explanation because it has long been a favorite for professional traders and hedge
funds. Volatility can be deﬁned as a measure of a currency’s expected ﬂuctuation
over a given time period based on past price ﬂuctuations. This is typically calculated
by taking the historic annual standard deviation of daily price changes. Future prices
help to determine implied volatility, which is used to calculate option premiums.
Although this sounds fairly complicated, its application is not. Basically, option
volatilities measure the rate and magnitude of a currency’s price over a given period
of time based on historical ﬂuctuations. Therefore, if the average daily trading range
of the EURUSD contracted from 100 pips to 60 pips and stayed there for two
FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY192weeks, in all likelihood, short- term volatility also contra cted signiﬁcantly compared
to longer-term volatility during the same time period.
■How to Use Option Volatilities to Trade Forex
As a guideline, there are two simple rules to follow. The ﬁrst one is that if
short-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly lower than long-term volatilities, one
should expect a breakout, though the direction of the breakout will not be deﬁned
by this rule. Lastly, if short-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than
long-term volatilities, one should expect a reversion to range trading.
Why Does This Technique Work?
During a period of consolidation, implied option volatilities are either low or on
the decline. The inspiration for these rules is that in periods of range trading, there
tends to be little movement. We care most about when option volatilities drop
sharply, which could be a sign that a proﬁtable break is underway. When short-term
volatility is above long-term volatility, it means that near-term price action is more
volatile than the long-term average price action. This suggests that the ranges will
eventually contract back toward average levels. The trend is most noticeable in
empirical data. Below are a few examples of how this rule predicted breakouts
that turned into new trends but before analyzing the charts, it is important to note
that we use one-month volatilities as our short-term volatilities and three-month
volatilities as our long-term volatilities.
In Figure 24.1, the one-month volatility of GBPUSD is generally close to three-
month volatilities. However, the ﬁrst arrow shows an instance where short-term
volatility spiked above long-term volatility during a period of GBPUSD weakness.
This signaled a correction or relief rally in the currency pair and that was exactly
what we saw in September when the GBPUSD bounced more than 200 pips. The
second arrow shows an instance where short-term volatility spiked well below
long-term volatility and that foreshadowed a major breakdown in the currency pair.
In this case, GBPUSD dropped over 600 pips after a period of consolidation.
In Figure 24.2 we have a chart of USDJPY. Like GBPUSD, the one-month and
three-month option volatilities move very closely. However in May, one-month
volatilities dropped sharply below three-month volatilities and that foreshadowed
the ﬁrst breakout in more than two months.
Who Can Beneﬁt from This Technique?
This strategy is not only useful for breakout traders, but range traders can also utilize
this information for their trading. If volatility contracts signiﬁcantly or becomes very

FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY194low, the likelihood of continued range trading decreases. After eyeing a historical
range, traders should look at volatiliti es to estimate the likelihood that the spot
price will remain within this range. Should the trader decide to go long or short
this range, he or she should continue to monitor volatility as long as he or she has
an open position in the pair to assist them in determining when to close out that
position. If short-term volatilities fall well below long-term volatilities, the trader
should consider closing their position if the suspected breakout is not in their favor.
The potential break is likely to work in the favor of the trader if the current spot
is close to the limit and far from the stop. In this hypothetical situation, it may be
proﬁtable to move limit prices away from current spot prices to increase proﬁts
from the potential break. If the spot price is close to the stop price and far from the
limit price, the break is likely to work against the trader, and the trader should close
his or her position immediately.
Breakout traders can monitor volatilities to verify a breakout. If traders suspect
a breakout, he or she can verify this breakout though implied volatilities. Should
implied volatility be constant or rising, there is a higher probability that the currency
will continue to trade in range than if vola tility is low or falling. In other words,
breakout traders should look for short-term volatilities to be signiﬁcantly lower than
long-term volatilities before making a breakout trade.
Aside from being a key component for pricing, option volatilities can also be
a useful tool for forecasting market activities. Option volatilities measure the rate
and magnitude of the changes in a currency’ s prices. Implied option volatilities, on
the other hand, measure the expected ﬂuctuation of a currency’s price over a given
period of time based on historical ﬂuctuations.
■Tracking Volatilities on Your Own
Volatility tracking typically involves taking the historic annual standard deviation of
daily price changes. Generally speaking, we use three-month volatilities for long-
term volatilities numbers and one-month volatilities for the short term. Volatilities
can be found on Bloomberg or Reuters.
The next step is to start compiling a list of data with the date, currency pair price,
implied one-month volatility, and implie d three-month volatility for the various
currency pairs in Excel. It might also be beneﬁcial to ﬁnd the difference between the
one-month and three-month volatilities to look for large differentials or to calculate
one-month volatility as a percentage of three-month volatility.
Once a sufﬁcient amount of data is compiled, one can graph the data as a visual
aid. The graph should use two y-axes, with spot prices on one and short- and
long-term volatilities on the other. If desired, the differences in short- and long-term
volatilities can be graphed as well in a separate, single y-axis graph.
195CHAPTER 25
Fundamental
Trading Strategy:
Intervention
Intervention by central banks is one of the most important short- and long-term
fundamentally driven market movers for the currency market. For short-term
traders, intervention can lead to sharp intraday movements on the scale of 150–250
pips in a matter of minutes. For longer-term traders, intervention can signal a
signiﬁcant change in trend because it suggests that the central bank is shifting or
solidifying its stance and sending a message to the market that they are backing certain
directional move in their currency. There are basically two types of intervention:
sterilized and unsterilized. Sterilized intervention requires offsetting intervention
with the buying or selling of government bonds while unsterilized intervention
involves no changes to the monetary base to offset intervention. Many argue that
unsterilized intervention has a more lasting effect on the currency than sterilized
intervention.
Taking a look at some of the following case studies, it is apparent that interventions
in general are important to watch and can have large impacts on a currency pair’s
price action. Although the actual timing of an intervention tends to be a surprise,
quite often the market will begin talking about the need for intervention days or
weeks before the actual intervention occurs. The direction of an intervention is
almost always known in advance because the central bank will typically come across
the newswires complaining about too much strength or weakness in their currency.
FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION196These warnings give traders a window of opportunity to participate in what could
be signiﬁcant proﬁt potentials or to stay out of the markets. The only thing to watch
out for, which you will see in our case study is that the sharp intervention based
rallies or selloffs can quickly be reversed as speculators come into the market to
‘‘fade the central bank.’’ Whether or not the market fades, the central bank depends
on the frequency of central bank intervention, the success rate, the magnitude of
the intervention, the timing of the intervention, and whether fundamentals support
intervention. Intervention is much more prevalent in emerging market currencies
than in the G7 currencies because these countries need to prevent their local
currencies from appreciating too signiﬁcantly such that it would hinder economic
recovery and reduce the competitiveness of the country’s exports. Nonetheless, G7
interventions will happen and its rarity is exactly what makes them signiﬁcant.
■Japan
In the past two decades, the central bank most willing to engage intervention is the
Bank of Japan. As an export dependent country, a strong yen poses a major risk to
the export sector. While the Bank of Japan conducts the intervention, the decision
is made by the Ministry of Finance. The most recent case of intervention by the
Japanese gover nment was in 2011. The BoJ largely s tayed out of the market between
2012 and 2015 because Abenomics helped to drive a recovery in the economy. On
October 31, 2011, USDJPY hit a record low, which means that the Japanese yen hit
a record high. Frustrated with the currency’s strength after the 2011 earthquake and
tsunami, the Japanese government came into the forex market aggressively to sell
the yen and buy the dollar. On that day, their intervention efforts drove USDJPY
from a low of 75.575 to a high of 79.50, almost 400 pips. As shown in Figure 25.1,
90% of this move happened in the ﬁrst 35 minutes.

FIGURE 25.1 USDJPY Chart
FUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION197The Bank of Japan also bought USDJPY in August 2011, but one of their biggest
intervention programs was in March 2011, when central banks around the world
joined the BoJ to sell the yen as a sign of solidarity after an earthquake and tsunami
drove the currency to a record high. On that day, intervention only drove USDJPY
from 79.18 to 82, but a few weeks later it hit a high of 85.50, as shown in Figure 25.2.
The Bank of Japan also intervened in September 2015 and as shown in Figure 25.3,
a daily chart, USDJPY jumped nearly 300 pips that day. Typically, USDJPY will
move 75 to 150 pips on an average day, so a 300-pip move that happens in minutes
is signiﬁcant. In all but one of these four cases, the intervention move was reversed
almost immediately. The only reason why USDJPY extended its rally in March 2011
was because the intervention was coordinated with other central banks, making it
more powerful.
While the Japanese government has been quieter in recent years, they were
very active in the early twenty-ﬁrst cen tury. The frequency and strength of BoJ
intervention during this period created an invisible ﬂoor under USDJPY. Although
there has been no more mention of this ﬂoor in recent years, the BoJ/MoF instilled
enough fear that intervention is always a worry. This fear is well justiﬁed because in
the event of BoJ intervention, the average 100-pip daily range can easily triple.
Japanese intervention can be traded one of two ways—ride the move on the
day of intervention or fade it in the days that follow. The key is not to be greedy,
because the Japanese government can always step in again. Committing to take a
solid 100-pip proﬁt (of a 150–200 pip move) or using a very short-term intraday
trailing stop of 15–20 pips, for example, can be helpful.
■Switzerland
The Swiss National Bank’s 1.20 EURCHF ﬂoor is another form of intervention.
Faced with a high level of uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued
currency, and deﬂation risks in 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange
rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At the time, they pledged to sell francs in an unlimited
quantity to maintain the peg. The goal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping
the gain in the franc. As shown in Figure 25.4, the peg was very effective in keeping
EURCHF above 1.20 between late 2012 an d 2014. However, in January 2015, the
prospect of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank pushed the SNB to
abandon their peg, and their surprise announcement caused a 30% one-day decline
in EURCHF. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and
experienced massive losses as a result.
Other central banks have also intervened in their currency in the past decade
including the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Unfortunately, for the RBNZ, most
of their efforts failed with the currency rising after each round of intervention. For

currency after intervention.
■Eurozone
The European Central Bank on the other hand is fairly quiet. They have only
intervened a few times before, the most recent of which was in 2000. The ECB
came into the market to buy euros when the single currency dropped from 90 cents
to 84 cents. In January 1999, when the euro was ﬁrst launched it was valued at
1.17 against the U.S. dollar. Due to the sharp slide, the European Central Bank
(ECB) convinced the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada to
join them in coordinated intervention to prop up the euro for the ﬁrst time ever.
The Eurozone felt concerned that the market was lacking conﬁdence in their new
currency but also feared that the slide in their currency was increasing the cost of the
region’s oil imports. With energy prices hitting 10-year highs at the time, Europe’s
heavy dependence on oil imports necessitated a stronger currency. The U.S. agreed
to intervention because buying euros and selling dollars would help to boost the
value of European imports and aid in the funding of an already growing U.S. trade
deﬁcit. Tokyo joined in the intervention because they were becoming concerned
that the weaker euro was posing a threat to their own exports. Although the ECB
did not release details on the magnitude of their intervention, the Federal Reserve
reported having purchased 1.5 billion euros against the dollar on behalf of the ECB.
Even though the actual intervention itse lf caught the market by surprise, the ECB
gave good warning to the market with numerous bouts of verbal support from ECB
and EU ofﬁcials. For trading purposes, this would have given traders an opportunity
to buy euros in anticipation of intervention or to avoid shorting the EURUSD.
Figure 25.5 shows the price action of the EURUSD on the day of intervention.
Unfortunately, there is no minute data available dating back to September 2000,
but from the daily chart, we can see that on the day that the ECB intervened in the
euro (September 22, 2000), with the help of its trade partners, the EURUSD had a
high-low range of over 400 pips.
Even though intervention does not happen often, it is a very important fundamental
trading strategy because each time it occurs, price movements are substantial.
For traders, intervention has three major implications for trading:
1.Bet on intervention : Heed the warnings from central bank ofﬁcials and use it as
a signal for possible intervention—the invisible ﬂoor created by the Japanese
government gave USDJPY bulls plenty of opportunity to pick short-term
bottoms.
2.Avoid betting against intervention : Betting against intervention can be dangerous
because one bout of intervention by a central bank could easily trigger a

exacerbating the move.
3.Use stops when intervention is a risk : With the 24-hour nature of the market,
intervention can occur at any time of the day. Although stops should always be
entered into the trading platform immediately after the entry order is triggered,
having stops in place are even more important when intervention is a major risk.

Currency Proﬁles
and Outlook
In order to understand how to trade currencies effectively, it is important to have
a ﬁrm grasp of the general economic characteristics of the most commonly traded
currencies. This includes understanding which economic reports and factors have the
most signiﬁcant impact on a currency’s movements. For example, some currencies
are extremely sensitive to commodity price movements and others are not. Learn-
ing the characteristics or personalities of each currency will help traders understand
what factors inﬂuence the exchange rate on a short- and long-term basis. We will
look at the eight most actively traded currencies—the U.S. dollar, euro, British
pound, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian
dollars. Of course, the most important currency of them all is the U.S. dollar.
■Currency Proﬁle: U.S. Dollar (USD)
Broad Economic Overview
The United States is the world’s leading economic power, with gross domestic
product valued at over US$17 trillion as of 2014. This is the highest in the world,
and based on the purchasing power parity model, it is four times the size of Japan’s
output, ﬁve times the size of Germany’s, and seven times the size of the United
Kingdom’s. The United States is primarily a service-oriented country, with nearly
CURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK20480% of its GDP coming from real estate, transportation, ﬁnance, health care, and
business services. Yet, the sheer size of th e U.S. manufacturing sector still makes
the U.S. dollar particularly sensitive to developments in the manufacturing sector.
With the United States having the largest and most liquid equity and ﬁxed income
markets in the world, foreign investors have consistently increased their purchases
of U.S. assets. According to the IMF, fore ign direct investments into the U.S. are
equal to approximately 40% of total global net inﬂows for the United States. On a
net basis, the United States absorbs 71% of total foreign savings. This means that if
foreign investors are not satisﬁed with th eir returns in the U.S. asset markets and
they decide to repatriate their funds, this would have a signiﬁcant effect on U.S.
asset values and the U.S. dollar. More speciﬁcally, if foreign investors sell their
U.S. dollar denominated assets holdings in search of higher yielding assets elsewhere,
this would typically result in a decline in the value of the U.S. asset, as well as the
U.S. dollar.
The import and export volume of the United States also exceeds that of any other
country. This is due to the country’s sheer size, as true import and export volume
represent a mere 12% of GDP. Despite this large activity, on a netted basis, the
United States is running a very large current account deﬁcit of over $113 billion as
of Q4 2014. This is a major problem that the U.S. economy has been struggling
with for decades, as the large current account deﬁcit makes the U.S. dollar highly
sensitive to changes in capital ﬂows. In fact, in order to prevent a decline in the U.S.
dollar as a result of trade, the United States needs to attract a signiﬁcant amount
of capital inﬂows per day. Thankfully, the U.S. bond market is the largest in the
world, and Treasuries remain an attractive investment due to the lack of suitable
alternatives.
Most major economies also count the United States as its largest trading partner,
with U.S. trade representing 20% of tota l world trade. These rankings are very
important because changes in the value of the dollar and its volatility will impact the
U.S. trading activities with these respective countries. More speciﬁcally, a weaker
dollar will encourage more U.S. exports, whereas a stronger dollar could curb
foreign demand for American goods. However, since the United States is not a
trade-dependent economy, the strength of a dollar is less troublesome. Here’s a
breakdown of the most important trading partners for the United States, in order of
importance:

Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers—The Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve Board (Fed) is the monetary policy authority of the United
States. The Fed is responsible for setting and implementing monetary policy. The
board consists of a 12-member Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The
voting members of the FOMC are the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board,
plus ﬁve presidents of the 12 district reserve banks. The FOMC holds eight meetings
per year, which are widely watched for interest rate announcements or changes in
growth expectations. After four of those meetings, the head of the Central Bank
holds a press conference, and typically that is when major monetary policy changes
are made.
The Fed has a high degree of independence to set monetary authority. They are
less subject to political inﬂuences, as most members are accorded long terms that
allow them to remain in ofﬁce through periods of alternate party dominance in both
the presidency and Congress.
The Federal Reserve issues a biannual Monetary Policy Report in February and
July followed by the Humphrey–Hawkins testimony where the Federal Reserve
chairman responds to questions from both the Congress and the Banking Committees
in regards to this report. This report is important to watch, as it contains the FOMC
forecasts for GDP growth, inﬂation, and unemployment.
The Fed, unlike most other central banks, has a mandate or ‘‘long-run objectives’’
of ‘‘price stability and sustainable economic growth.’’ In order to adhere to these
goals, the Fed has to use monetary policy to limit inﬂation and unemployment
and achieve balanced growth. The most popular tools that the Fed uses to control
monetary policy include the following.
Open Market Operations
Open market operations involve Fed purchases of government securities, including
Treasury bills, notes and bonds. This is one of the most popular methods for
the Fed to signal and implement policy changes. Generally speaking, increases in
Fed purchases of government securities decreases interest rates, while selling of
government securities by the Fed boosts interest rates.
CURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK206Fed Funds Target
The Fed Funds target rate is the key policy target of the Federal Reserve. It is
the interest rate for borrowing that the Fed offers to its member banks. The Fed
tends to increase this rate to curb inﬂation or decrease this rate to promote growth
and consumption. Changes to this rate are closely watched by the market and tend
to imply major changes in policy and will typically have large ramiﬁcations for
global ﬁxed income and equity markets. The market also pays particular attention
to the statement released by the Federal Reserve as it can offer guidance for future
monetary policy actions.
Fiscal policy is in the hands of the U.S. Treasury. Fiscal policy decisions include
determining the appropriate level of taxes and government spending. In fact,
although the markets pay more attention to the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury
is the actual government body that determines dollar policy. That is, if they feel
that the USD rate on the foreign exchange market is under- or overvalued, the
U.S. Treasury is the government body that gives the NY Federal Reserve Board the
authority and instructions to intervene in the foreign exchange market by physically
selling or buying USD. Therefore, the Treasury’s view on dollar policy and changes
to that view can be important to the currency market.
Over the past few decades, the Treasury and Fed ofﬁcials have maintained a
‘‘strong dollar’’ bias. While a weak dollar helps to promote growth for political
reasons, the government is unlikely to change their stance in support of a weak
dollar policy.
Important Characteristics of the U.S. Dollar
■Over 80% of all currency deals involve the dollar . The most liquid currencies in the
foreign exchange market are the EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, and USDCHF.
These currencies represent the most commonly traded currencies in the world,
and it is no coincidence that all of these currency pairs involve the U.S. dollar. In
fact, 80% of all currency deals, which include currency conversion, hedging, and
trade settlement, involve the U.S. dolla r. This explains why U.S. data, the U.S.
dollar, and U.S. fundamentals are so important to foreign exchange traders.
■Prior to the introduction of the euro and the g rowing utilization of t he Chinese renminbi,
the U.S. dollar was considered one the world’s p remier ‘‘safe-haven’’ reserve currencies .T h e
U.S. dollar has long been one of the world’s premier ‘‘safe-haven’’ currencies, with
76% of global currency reserves held in dollars. To this day, the dollar is still the
preferred currency of choice, but in recent years its safe haven, reserve currency
status has been challenged by the euro and Chinese renminbi. We are still a very
long way from the dollar being usurped by either currency, but in the past decade,
many central banks have slowly diversiﬁed their reserves by reducing their dollar
holdings and increasing their euro and renminbi holdings. This trend will only
CURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK207accelerate in the years to come, but until European and Chinese bond markets are
large and developed enough to handle the reserve diversiﬁcation ﬂows, the dollar
and U.S. Treasuries will still be the inv estment of choice for reserve managers.
■The U.S. dollar moves in the opposite direction of gold prices . One of the unique
characteristics of the U.S. dollar is that there is a strong inverse relationship
between the price of gold and the value of the U.S. dollar as shown in Figure 26.1.
These two instruments are near-perfect mirror images of each other, which means
that when the value of the dollar declines, the price of gold rises; and when the
dollar appreciates, the price of gold falls. There is, of course, a good reason—gold
is priced in U.S. dollars. The correlation is not perfect—in times of geopolitical
uncertainty, investors generally prefer hard versus ﬁat currencies or gold versus
the dollar.
■Many emerging market countries ‘‘peg’ ’ their local currencies to the dollar . Pegging a
currency to the dollar refers to the idea that a government agrees to maintain their
currency at a speciﬁc rate or range to the U .S. dollar. As the value of the dollar
changes, this requires the central bank to buy or sell their local currency and
the U.S. dollar to maintain the peg. For example, let’s imagine that Country A
pledges to maintain a ﬁxed currency peg of 7.5 versus the U.S. dollar. If the dollar
weakens, causing downward pressure on the exchange rate, the central bank
would have to buy U.S. dollars and sell their local currency to maintain the peg.
After buying dollars, they would typically invest those funds into U.S. Treasuries.

FIGURE 26.1 Dollar Index vs. Gold
CURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK208This process is exactly how China and other Asian economies became large
holders of US Treasuries. Through the years, many countries have switched from
a ﬁxed to ﬂoating rate peg and in some cases a peg that references a basket of
currencies, but in each case, the dollar is still the leading component. However,
the movement from ﬁxed U.S. dollar pegs to a basket reduces the amount of
dollars that a country like China needs to buy, and as their currency regime and
others in the region are loosened further, the impact on the dollar will grow.
■Interest rate differentials between U.S. Tr easuries and foreign bonds strongly followed .T h e
interest rate differenti als between U.S. Treasuries and foreign bonds are a very
important relationship that professional FX traders need to follow. It can be a
strong indicator of potential currency movements because the U.S. market is one
of the largest markets in the world, and investors are very sensitive to the yields
that the offered by U.S. assets. Large investors are constantly looking for assets
with the highest yields. As yields in the U.S. decrease or if yields abroad increase,
this would induce investors to sell their U.S. assets and purchase foreign assets.
Selling U.S. ﬁxed income or equity assets would inﬂuence the currency market
because that would require selling U.S. dollars and buying the foreign currency.
If U.S. yields rise or foreign yields decrease, investors in general would be more
inclined to purchase U.S. assets, therefore boosting the value of the dollar (USD).
■Keep an eye on the dollar index . Market participants closely follow the U.S. dollar
index as a gauge of overall dollar strength or weakness. The USD index is a
futures contract traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) that is calculated
using the trade-weighted geometric average of six currencies. It is important to
follow this index because when market participants are reporting general dollar
weakness or a decline in the trade-weighted dollar, they are typically referring to
this index. Unfortunately, the weighting does not accurately reﬂect U.S. trade
activity. Nonetheless, the DXY is closely followed and actively traded. Also,
even though the dollar may have moved signiﬁcantly against a single currency, it
may have not moved as signiﬁcantly on a trade-weighted basis. This is important
because some central bankers may choose to focus on the trade-weighted index
instead of the individual currency pair’s performance against the dollar.
■The dollar is impacted by equities and Treasuries . In earlier chapters, we have
established that there is a strong corre lation between a country’s equity and
ﬁxed-income markets and its currency: If the equity market is rising, generally
speaking, foreign investment dollars should be coming in to seize the opportunity.
If equity markets are falling, domestic investors will be selling their shares of local
companies and looking for opportunities abroad. With ﬁxed-income markets,
economies boasting the most valuable ﬁxed income opportunities with the highest
yields will be capable of attracting more foreign investment. Daily ﬂuctuations
and developments in any of these markets reﬂect movement of foreign portfolio
CURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK209investments, which would require foreign exchange transactions. Cross border
merger and acquisition activities can also inﬂuence the price action of currencies.
Large M&A deals, particularly those that involve a signiﬁcant cash portion, will
have a notable impact on the currency markets. The reason is that the acquirer
will need to buy or sell dollars to fund their cross-border acquisition.
Important Economic Indicators for the United States
Economic data is always important, but U.S. data tends to have the greatest impact
on currencies because more than 80% of currency transactions involve the U.S.
dollar. Here are some of the most important and market moving pieces of U.S. data:
Employment: Nonfarm Payrolls
The employment report is the most important and widely watched indicator on the
economic calendar. Its importance is mostly due to political inﬂuences rather than
pure economic reasons, as the Fed is under strict pressure to keep unemployment
under control. As a result, interest rate policy is directly inﬂuenced by employment
conditions. The monthly jobs report consists of data compiled from two different
surveys: the establishment survey and the household survey. The establishment
survey provides data on nonf arm payroll employment, a verage hourly workweek,
and the aggregate hours index. The household survey provides information on the
labor force, household employment, and the unemployment rate. When this report
is released on the ﬁrst Friday of every month, forex traders will immediately hone
in on the nonfarm payrolls number, the unemployment rate, and average hourly
earnings. However, any revisions or seasonal adjustments can also impact the dollar’s
reaction to the overall report.
Consumer Price Index
The Consumer Price Index is a key gauge of inﬂation. The index measures the prices
on a ﬁxed basket of consumer goods. Economists tend to focus more on the CPI-U
or the core inﬂation rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy components.
The indicator is widely watched by the F X markets as it drives a lot of activity
because job growth and inﬂation is the key to monetary policy.
Retail Sales
The key to growth is consumer spending and for this reason, the retail sales report
is also extremely market moving. The Retail Sales Index measures the total goods
sold by a sampling of retail stores over the course of a month. This index is used as
a gauge of consumer consumption and consumer conﬁdence. The most important
number to watch is retail sales less autos, as auto sales can vary month-to-month.
While retail sales can be quite volatile due to seasonality, it is one of the most
important indicators on the health of the economy along with a key input for GDP.
CURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK210Nonmanufacturing and Manufacturing ISM
The monthly nonmanufacturing and manufacturing reports released by the Institute
for Supply Management is also important because it generally provides the most
current information on activity in the economy. ISM releases a monthly composite
index based on surveys of 300 purchasing managers nationwide representing 20
different industries. An index value above 50 reﬂects expansion, while values below
50 are indicative of contraction. The ISM nonmanufacturing index is particularly
important because the United States is a services economy, and typically this report
is released ahead of nonfarm payrolls; and the employment subcomponent can
provide early clues on the health of the labor market.
Consumer Conﬁdence
The Consumer Conﬁdence Survey measures how individuals feel about the economy.
There are two popular reports—one released by the Conference Board and one
by the University of Michigan. In the Conference Board survey, questionnaires
are sent out to a nationwide representative sample of 5,000 households, of which
approximately 3,500 respond. Households are asked ﬁve questions:
1. A rating of business conditions in the household’s area
2. A rating of business conditions in six months
3. Job availability in the area
4. Job availability in six months
5. Family income in six months
Responses are seasonally adjusted and an index is constructed for each response,
and then a composite index is fashioned based on the aggregate responses. The
University of Michigan Survey, on the other hand, only polls 500 people, but since
it is released before the Conference Board’s report, it can have a larger impact
on currencies. Rising c onsumer conﬁdence is viewed as a precursor to stronger
consumer spending and growth.
Producer Price Index
The Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes in
selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. PPI tracks changes
in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy, includ-
ing agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing, and
mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished goods
PPI and how the index has reacted on a monthly, quarterly, and annualized basis.
Gross Domestic Product
Gross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure of the total production and
consumption of goods and services. In the United States, the Bureau of Economic
CURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK211Analysis (BEA) constructs two complementary measures of GDP, one based on
income and one based on expenditures. The advance release of GDP, which occurs
the month after each quarter ends, contains some BEA estimates for data not yet
released, inventories and trade balance, and is the most important release. Other
releases of GDP, which are the revisions, are typically not very signiﬁcant unless a
major change is made.
International Trade
The balance of trade represents the di fference between exports and imports of
foreign trade in goods and services. Merchandise data are provided for U.S. total
foreign trade with all countries and details for trade with speciﬁc countries and
regions of the world, as well as for individual commodities. Traders tend to focus
on seasonally adjusted trade numbers over a three-month period as single month
trade periods are regarded as volatile and less reliable.
Employment Cost Index (ECI)
The employment cost index data is based on a survey of employer payrolls in the
third month of the quarter for the pay period ending on the twelfth day of the
month. This survey is a probability sample of approximately 3,600 private industry
employers and 700 state and local governments, public schools, and public hospitals.
The big advantage of ECI is that it includes nonwage costs, which adds as much
as 30% to total labor costs. Reaction to the ECI, however, is often muted as it
is generally very stable. It should be noted however that it is one of the Federal
Reserve’s favorite indicators.
Industrial Production
The Index of Industrial Production is a set of indexes that measures the monthly
physical output of U.S. factories, mines, and utilities. The index is broken down
by industry type and market type. Foreign exchange markets focus mostly on the
seasonally adjusted monthly change in aggregate ﬁgure. Increases in the index are
typically dollar positive.
Treasury International Capital Flow Data (TIC Data)
The Treasury International Capital ﬂow data measures the amount of capital ﬂow
into the United States on a monthly basis. This economic release has become
increasingly important over the past few years since the funding of the U.S. deﬁcit
is becoming more of an issue. Aside from the headline number itself, the market
also pays close attention to the ofﬁcial ﬂows, which represents the demand for U.S.
government debt by foreign central banks.

213CHAPTER 27
Currency Proﬁle:
Euro (EUR)
■Broad Economic Overview
The European Union (EU) was developed as an institutional framework for the
construction of a united Europe. As of May 2015, the EU consists of 28 member
countries with 19 of these nations sharing the euro as a common currency. The
Eurozone consists of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. With the exception of Denmark and the
United Kingdom, other EU states are obliged to join the monetary union when they
meet the criteria to do so. Aside from a common currency, these countries also
share a single monetary policy dictated by the European Central Bank (ECB). These
common currency countries constitute the European Monetary Union (EMU).
The EMU is the world’s second largest economic power, with gross domestic
product valued at approximately US$18 trillion in 2014. With a highly developed
ﬁxed income, equity, and futures market, the EMU is the second most attractive
investment market for domestic and international investors. In its early days, the
EMU found difﬁculty attracting foreign direct investment or large capital ﬂows
because, historically, the U.S. markets are larger with more consistent returns. As
a result, the U.S. absorbs 71% of total foreign savings. However, with the euro
becoming an established currency and the European Monetary Union incorporating
more members, the euro’s importance as a reserve currency is rising and translating
into greater capital ﬂows. The only problem is that European bond markets are
CURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)214fragmented, and there are not enough quality assets for central banks to invest in.
Unless there are euro bonds, foreign central banks could be slow to diversify their
reserve holdings. Nonetheless, they will do so gradually, providing ongoing support
for the euro.
Trade is extremely important to Eurozone nations and most countries conduct
the majority of their trade with other states in the region. This is important because
one of the most valuable aspects of the euro is its facilitation of trade activity through
the elimination of exchange rate risk. Large Eurozone nations such as Germany,
France, Italy, and Spain also conduct signiﬁcant trade activity with countries like the
United States and China. This makes the value of the euro particularly important
to economic activity. A country like the United States is less sensitive to exchange
rate ﬂuctuations because most of its demand is internal, but Europe is extremely
sensitive to its exchange rate because many Eurozone nations rely on external
demand. The size and scope of the EMU’s trade with the rest of the world provides
it with signiﬁcant power in the international trade arena. International clout is also
one of the primary goals in the formation of the European Union, because it allows
individual nations to negotiate as a group on an equal playing ﬁeld with the United
States and China, their two largest trading partners. The breakdowns of the most
important trading partners for the European Union are the following:
Leading Export Markets
1. United States
2. China
3. Switzerland
4. Russia
5. Turkey
Leading Import Sources
1. China
2. Russia
3. United States
4. Norway
5. Switzerland
While trade is extremely important, the service sector has the largest share of
total output followed by manufacturing. In fact, a large number of the companies
whose primary purpose is to produce ﬁnished products still concentrate their EU
activity on innovation, research, design, and marketing, while outsourcing most of
their manufacturing activities to Asia.
The EU’s growing role in international trade has major implications for the role of
the euro as a reserve currency. As more countries conduct trade with the Eurozone,
CURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)215they will be motivated to accumulate more euros to reduce exchange risk and
transaction costs. Traditionally, most international trade transactions involve the
British pound, the Japanese yen, and/or the U.S. dollar. Before the establishment of
the euro, it was unreasonable to hold large amounts of every individual EU national
currency. As a result, currency reserves tended toward the dollar. At the end of the
1990s, approximately 65% of all world reserves were held in U.S. dollars, but after
the introduction of the euro, foreign reserve assets slowly shifted towards the euro.
This trend will only continue as the world becomes more globalized.
■Monetary and Fiscal Policy
Makers—The European Central Bank
The European Central Bank (ECB) is the governing body responsible for determining
the monetary policy of the countries participating in the EMU. The Executive Board
of the EMU consists of the president of the ECB, the vice president of the ECB, and
four other members. These individuals, along with the governors of the national
central banks, comprise the Governing Council. The ECB is set up such that the
Executive Board implements the policies dictated by the Governing Council. New
monetary policies decisions are typically made by majority vote, with the president
having the casting vote in the event of a tie in their monthly meeting. After each
meeting the Central Bank president holds a press conference to answer questions.
This is also used as an opportunity to clarify their monetary policy stance.
The EMU’s primary objective is to maintain price stability and promote growth.
Monetary and ﬁscal policy changes are made to ensure that this objective is met. With
the formation of the EMU, the Maastric ht Treaty was developed by the Union to
apply a number of criteria for each member country. These criteria were developed
by the Union to help them achieve their objective. Deviations from these criteria
by any one country will result in heavy ﬁnes. Listed below are the EMU criteria.
It is apparent based on these criteria that the ECB has a strict mandate focused on
inﬂation and deﬁcit. Generally, the ECB strives to maintain annual growth in HCPI
(Harmonized Consumer Price Index) below 2% and M3 (Money Supply) annual
growth around 4.5%.
The EMU Criteria
In the 1992 Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) the following
preconditions were created for any EU member state looking to join the economic
and monetary union (EMU).
■A rate of inﬂation no more than 1.5% above the average of the three best
performing member states, taking the average of the 12-month year-on-year rate
preceding the assessment date.
CURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)216■Long-term interest rates not exceeding the average rates of these low-inﬂation
states by more than 2% for the preceding 12 months.
■Exchange rates which ﬂuctuate within the normal margins of the exchange-rate
mechanism (ERM) for at least two years.
■A general government debt/GDP ratio of not more than 60%, although a higher
ratio may be permissible if it is ‘‘sufﬁciently diminishing.’’
■A general government deﬁcit not exceeding 3% of GDP, although a small and
temporary excess can be permitted.
If a country meets the convergence criteria and joins the EMU, their monetary
policy will be determined by the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB and the
ESCB (European System of Central Banks) are independent institutions from both
national governments and other EU institutions, granting them complete control
over monetary policy. This operational independence is accorded to them as per
Article 108 of the Maastricht Treaty, which states that any member of the decision-
making bodies cannot seek or take instructions from any Community Institutions,
any government of a member state, or any other body. In other words, no one
country can pressure the ECB into making a monetary policy change that is in only
their best interest. The primary tools the ECB uses to control monetary policy is the
following.
Open Market Operations
The ECB has four main categories of open market operations to steer interest rates,
manage liquidity, and signal monetary policy stance. This includes:
■Main reﬁnancing operations . These are regular liquidity-providing reverse transac-
tions conducted weekly with a maturity o f two weeks, which provide the bulk of
reﬁnancing to the ﬁnancial sector.
■Longer-term reﬁnancing operations . These are liquidity-providing reverse transactions
with a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months, which provide
counterparties with additional longer-term reﬁnancing.
■Fine-tuning operations . These are executed on an ad-hoc basis, with the aim of
both managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates, in
particular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected
liquidity ﬂuctuations.
■Structural operations . These involve the issuance of debt certiﬁcates, reverse trans-
actions, and outright transactions. These operations will be executed whenever
the ECB wishes to adjust th e structural position of the Eurosystem vis-` a-vis the
ﬁnancial sector (on a regular or nonregular basis).
CURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)217ECB Minimum Bid Rate (Repo Rate)
The ECB minimum bid rate is the key policy target for the ECB and the level of
borrowing that the ECB offers to the central banks of its member states. This is also
the rate that is subject to change at the monthly ECB meetings. Since inﬂation is a
major concern for European policy makers, they are generally more inclined to keep
interest rates at lofty levels to prevent inﬂation. Changes in the ECB’s minimum bid
rate can have large ramiﬁcations for the EUR.
The ECB does not have an exchange rate target, but will factor in exchange rates
in their policy deliberations because they can affect price stability. A high exchange
rate lowers inﬂationary pressures while a low exchange rate promotes it. The ECB is
not prohibited from intervening in the foreign exchange markets if they believe that
inﬂation is a concern. As a result, comments by members of the Governing Council
are closely watched by forex traders and can have a signiﬁcant impact on the euro.
In addition to their monthly meetings, the Central Bank will also publish a
monthly bulletin and release staff forecasts and minutes from past meetings. The
president of the Central Bank holds a press conference after the policy meeting and
that, along with each of these event risk s, can cause volatility in the currency.
Now let’s take a look at some of the important characteristics of the euro:
■EURUSD cross is the most liquid and actively traded currency . The euro was introduced
as an electronic currency in January 1999. At the time, the euro replaced all
pre-EMU currencies, except for Greece’s currency, which was converted to the
euro in January 2001. As a result, the EURUSD cross is now the most liquid
currency in the world and its movements are used as the primary gauge of the
health of both the European and U.S. economies. Figure 27.1 highlights the
10 year performance of EUR-USD. The euro is most frequently known as the
‘‘anti-dollar’’ since dollar or U.S. fundamentals generally have a greater impact
on the movement of the currency.
EURJPY and EURCHF are also very liquid currencies that can be used as a
gauge of the health of the Japanese and Swiss economies. Many new traders will
start with the EURUSD because of its orderly movements, tight spread, and
liquidity.
■Euro: A currency without a country . One of the greatest problems of the euro is that it
is currency without a country. Instead, it bears the economic, political, and social
risks of 19 different nations. This is its gr eatest strength and its greatest weakness.
In the past decade, we have seen how the debt crisis in smaller Eurozone nations
have affected the currency as a whole. It undermines conﬁdence and has, on many
occasions, put the entire monetary union at risk.
■Spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and 10-year Bunds can indicate euro sentiment .
Ten-year government bonds can serve as an important indicator of where the euro
CURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)218
FIGURE 27.1 EURUSD 10-Year Chart
Source: eSignal
CURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)219is headed, especially against the U.S. dollar. The differential between the 10-year
U.S. government bond and the 10-year German Bund rates can provide a good
indication for EURUSD’s movement. If Bund rates are higher than U.S. Treasury
rates and the differential increases, or the spread widens, this is generally positive
for the EURUSD. Alternatively, a decrease in the differential or a tightening of
the interest rates is generally bearish for EURUSD. As there is no Euro bond,
the 10-year German Bund yield is typically used as the benchmark bond for the
Eurozone because Germany is the largest country in the monetary union.
■Predictions for euro area money ﬂows . Another useful rate to follow is the three-month
interest rate, also known as the euro interbank offer rate or the Euribor rate. This
is the rate offered from one large bank to another on interbank term deposits.
Traders tend to compare the Euribor futures rate with the Eurodollar futures rate.
Eurodollars are deposits denominated in U.S. dollars at banks and other ﬁnancial
institutions outside the United States. Because investors like high-yielding assets,
European ﬁxed-income assets become more attractive as the spread between
Euribor futures and Eurodollar futures widens in favor of Euribors. As the spread
narrows, European assets become less attractive, whereby implying a potential
decrease in money ﬂows into the Euro.
Mergers and acquisition activity can also affect how the EURUSD moves.
In recent years we have seen increased M&A activity between EU and U.S.
multinationals. Large deals, especially with a large cash component, can lead to a
sudden burst in the EURUSD, but the reaction is generally short-lived.
■Important Indicators for the Euro
When it comes to Eurozone economic reports, the only ones that affect the euro are
German or Eurozone data. The largest countries in the Eurozone in order of GDP
contribution are Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. While French and Italian data
are important, they rarely move the currency. So what forex traders should focus on
are the broader regional reports and German data. Central bank rate decisions are
the most important, but here are some additional economic reports that can have
meaningful impact on the currency.
PMIs
Every month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the Manufacturing
and Service sectors. For the Eurozone, they provide this data for the four largest
economies and a composite index for the region. These numbers are extremely
market moving because they provide the most up-to-date information on how each
of the economies are performing in the current month and not how the economies
CURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)220performed the previous month like many other reports. However, since the reports
are for the current period, they are usually subject to revisions so the euro will
move on the preliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents
expansion, and a reading below 50 represents contraction. For the Eurozone, the
manufacturing PMI index is the most important along with the composite index,
which aggregates how the manufacturing and service sector are performing. Since
the German data are released shortly before the Eurozone report, they can have a
greater impact on the currency.
IFO Survey
Germany is by far the largest economy in Europe and is responsible for approximately
20% of total GDP. Any insight into German business conditions is seen as an insight
into Europe as a whole. The IFO is a monthly survey conducted by the IFO institute.
They survey over 7,000 German businesses, asking for their assessment of the
German business climate and their short-term plans. The initial publication of the
results consists of the business climate headline ﬁgure and its two equally weighted
subindices: current business conditions and business expectations. The typical range
is from 80 to 120, with a higher number indicating greater business conﬁdence. The
report is most valuable, however, when measured against previous data.
Inﬂation Indicators—HICP
Since the ECB has an inﬂation mandate, the EU Harmonized Index of Consumer
Prices (HICP) published by Eurostat is very important. This harmonized index is
designed for international comparison as required by EU law. The index is compiled
with information on prices retrieved by each national statistical agency. Individual
countries are required to provide Eurostat with the 100 indices used to compute the
HICP. The national HICPs are totaled by Eurostat as a weighted average of these
subindices, and the weights used are country-speciﬁc. The HICP is released at the
end of the month following the reference period, which is about 10 days after the
publications of the national CPIs from Spain and France, the ﬁnal EMU-5 countries
to release their CPIs. Even if part of the information is already known when the
HICP is released, it is an important release because it serves as the reference inﬂation
index for the ECB who aims to keep Eurozone consumer price inﬂation between
0% and 2%.
German Industrial Production
Industrial production data are seasonally adjusted (SA) and include a breakdown into
four major subcategories: mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction. The
manufacturing aggregate comprises four main product groups: basic and producer
CURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)221goods, capital goods, consumer durables, and consumer nondurables. The market
tends to pay attention to the annual rate of change and the seasonally adjusted
month-on-month ﬁgure. Germany’s ﬁgure is most important since it is the largest
country in the Eurozone; however, the market can also react to the French industrial
production report. The initial industrial production release is based on a narrower
data sample and hence subject to revision when the full sample has become available.
The ministry occasionally provides insight on the expected direction of the revision
in the initial data release.
German Unemployment
Labor market numbers are important for every country and in the case of the
Eurozone, German unemployment is the most important. Released by the Labor
Ofﬁce, the data contain information on the number of unemployed, as well as
the changes on the previous month, on both seasonally (SA) and nonseasonally
(NSA) adjusted terms. The NSA unemployment rate is provided, along with data
on vacancies, short-shift working arrangements, and the number of employees
(temporarily suspended in 1999). Within an hour after the FLO release, the
Bundesbank releases the SA unemployment rate. The day ahead of the release,
there is often a leak of the ofﬁcial data from a trade-union source. The leak is
usually of the NSA level of unemployment in millions. When a precise ﬁgure is
reported on Reuters, as given by ‘‘sources’’ for the NSA level of unemployment,
the leak usually reﬂects t he ofﬁcial ﬁgures. Rumors often circulate up to one week
before the ofﬁcial release, and they are notoriously imprecise. Regardless, a drop
in unemployment along with an improvement in the jobless rate is positive for the
currency, whereas a rise in jobless claims or increase in the unemployment rate is
negative for the currency.
Preliminary GDP
Preliminary GDP is issued when Eurostat has collected data from a sufﬁcient number
of countries to produce an estimate. This usually includes France, Germany, and
the Netherlands. However, Italy is not included in the preliminary release and is
only added in the ﬁnal number. The yearly aggregates for EU-15 and EMU-11
are a simple sum of national GDP. For the quarterly accounts, the aggregation is
more complex since some countries (Greece, Ireland, and Luxembourg) do not
yet produce quarterly national accounts data. Moreover, Portugal produces only
partial quarterly accounts with a signiﬁcant lag. Thus, both the EU-15 and EMU-11
quarterly paths are the result of estimates from quarterly data based on a group of
countries accounting for more than 95% of total EU GDP (see the Foreword for a
detailed description of the weights of each country in the EU).
CURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)222M3
M3 is a broad measure of money supply, which includes everything from notes
and coins to bank deposits. The ECB closely monitors M3 as they view it as a key
measure of inﬂation. At its session in December 1998, the governing council of the
ECB set its ﬁrst reference value for M3 growth at 4.5%. This value supports inﬂation
b e l o w2 % ,t r e n dg r o w t ho f2 %t o2 . 5 % ,a n dal o n g - t e r md e c l i n ei nt h ev e l o c i t y
of money by 0.5% to 1%. The growth rate is monitored on a three-month moving
average basis in order to prevent monthly volatility to distort the information given
by the aggregate. The ECB’s approach to monetary targeting leaves considerable
room for maneuver and interpretation. Because the ECB does not impose bands
on M3 growth, as the Bundesbank used to do, there will be no automatic action
when M3 growth diverges from the reference value. Moreover, although the ECB
considers M3 to be the key indicator, it will also take into account the changes in
other monetary aggregates.
Individual Country Budget Deﬁcits
The Stability and Growth Pact states that budget deﬁcits for every country in the
monetary union must be kept below 3% of GDP. Failure to meet these targets will
be punished. However through the years many Eurozone nations have had deﬁcits
in excess of 3% and penalties have not been enforced.

■Broad Economic Overview
The United Kingdom is the world’s ﬁfth largest economy with GDP valued at
approximately US$3 trillion in 2014 according to the IMF. With one of the most
dynamic central banks in the world, the UK economy beneﬁted from many years of
strong growth, low unemployment, expa nding output, and resilient consumption.
The strength of consumer consumption has been largely due to the strong housing
market. The United Kingdom is a service-oriented economy, with manufacturing
representing an increasingly smaller portion of GDP, now equivalent to only one-
ﬁfth of national output. Their capital market system is one of the most developed
in the world, with ﬁnance and banking being the strongest contributors to GDP.
Although the majority of the UK’s GDP is from services, it is also one of the
largest producers and exporters of natural gas in the European Union. The energy
production industry accounts for 10% of GDP, which is one of the highest shares of
any industrialized nation. This is particularly important, as increases in energy prices
(such as oil) will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt the large number of UK oil exporters. (The
United Kingdom became a net oil importer for a brief period due to disruptions in
the North Sea in 2003, but it has already resumed its status as a net oil exporter.)
Overall, the United Kingdom is a net importer of goods with a consistent
trade deﬁcit. Its largest trading partner is the EU, with trade between the two
constituencies accounting for over 50% of all of the country’s import and export
activities. The United States, on an individual basis, still remains the United
CURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)224Kingdom’s largest trading partner. The breakdowns of the most important trading
partners for the United Kingdom are the following:

2. Germany
3. Switzerland
4. Netherlands
5. France
Leading Import Sources
1. Germany
2. Netherlands
3. China

5. France
Since the launch of the euro in 1999, the single currency’s troubles have become
increasingly apparent, and this has made the UK’s decision to maintain its own
currency and monetary authority increasingly intelligent. Yet the possibility of euro
adoption will remain a question in the minds of pound traders for many years
to come, although in 2015 into 2016, the more relevant question is whether the
United Kingdom will remain in the EMU. A decision on euro entry has signiﬁcant
ramiﬁcations for the UK economy—the most important of which is that UK interest
rates would have to be adjusted to reﬂect the equivalent interest rate of the Eurozone.
One of the primary arguments against adopting the euro is that the UK government
has sound macroeconomic policies that have worked very well for the country for
decades. Its successful monetary and ﬁscal policies have led it to outperform most
major economies during economic downturns, including the European Union.
The UK Treasury has previously speciﬁed ﬁve economic tests that must be met
prior to euro entry, which are the following:
UK’s Five Economic Tests for Euro
1. Is there sustainable convergence in business cycles and economic structures
between the United Kingdom and other EMU members, so that the UK citizens
could live comfortably with euro interest rates on a permanent basis?
2. Is there enough ﬂexibility to cope with economic change?
3. Would joining the EMU create an environment that would encourage ﬁrms to
invest in the United Kingdom?
4. Would joining the EMU have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the
UK’s ﬁnancial services industry?
5. Would joining the EMU be good for promoting stability and growth in
employment?
CURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)225The United Kingdom is a very political country where government ofﬁcials are
highly concerned with voter approval. If voters do not support euro entry, the
likelihood of EMU entry would decline. The following are some of the arguments
for and against adopting the euro:
Arguments in Favor of Adopting the Euro
■There would be reduced exchange rate uncertainty for UK businesses and lower
exchange rate transa ction costs or risks.
■The prospect of sustained low inﬂation under the governance of the European
Central Bank should reduce long-term interest rates and stimulate sustained
economic growth.
■Single currency promotes price transparency.
■The integration of national ﬁnancial markets of the EU will lead to higher efﬁciency
in the allocation of capital in Europe.
■The euro is the second most important reserve currency after the USD.
■With the United Kingdom joining the euro, the political clout of the EMU would
increase dramatically.
Arguments against Adopting the Euro
■Currency unions have collapsed in the past.
■Economic or political instabilities of one country would impact the Euro, which
would have exchange rate ramiﬁcations for otherwise healthy countries.
■Strict EMU criteria outlined by the Stability and Growth Pact.
■Entry would mean a permanent transfer of domestic monetary authority to the
European Central Bank.
■Joining a currency union with no monetary ﬂexibility would require the United
Kingdom to have more ﬂexibility in the labor and housing markets.
■There are fears about which countries might dominate the ECB.
■Adjusting to new currency will require large transaction costs.
■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Bank
of England
For the United Kingdom, the Bank of England (BoE) controls monetary policy, and
the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is a nine-member committee responsible
for setting interest rate policy in the United Kingdom. It consists of a governor,
two deputy governors, two executive directors of the central bank, and four outside
CURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)226experts. The committee was granted operational independence in 1997, which
means they won’t be inﬂuenced by the governing party. Despite this independence,
monetary policies have centered on achieving an inﬂation target dictated by the
Chancellor of the Treasury. Currently, this target is RPIX (Retail Price Index)
inﬂation of 2.5%. The central bank has the power to change interest rates to levels
that will allow them to meet this target. The MPC holds monthly meetings, which
are closely followed for announcements on changes in monetary policy, including
changes in the interest rate (bank repo rate). When no changes are made, no details
are provided. In this case, the rate decision is generally a nonevent for the currency,
with traders shifting their focus to the minutes released two weeks later.
The MPC publishes statements after every meeting, along with a quarterly
Inﬂation Report that details the MPC’s two-year forecast for growth and inﬂation
along with justiﬁcation for policy movements. In addition, another publication,
theQuarterly Bulletin, provides information on past monetary policy movements
and analysis of the international economic environment and its impacts on the UK
economy. All of these reports can provide guidance of future policy changes. The
main policy tools used by the MPC and BoE are the following.
Bank Repo Rate
This is the key rate used in monetary policy to meet the Treasury’s inﬂation target.
This rate is set for the Bank’s own operati ons in the market, such as its short-term
lending activities. Changes to this rate affect the rates set by the commercial banks
for their savers and borrowers. In turn, this rate will affect spending and output in
the economy, and eventually costs and prices. An increase in this rate would imply
an attempt to curb inﬂation and slow growth, while a decrease in this rate would be
aimed at stimulating growth and expansion.
Open Market Operations
The goal of open market operations is to implement changes in the bank repo rate,
while assuring adequate liquidity in the market and continued stability in the banking
system. This is reﬂective of the three main objectives of the BoE: maintaining the
integrity and value of the currency, maintaining the stability of the ﬁnancial system,
and seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the United Kingdom’s ﬁnancial services.
To ensure liquidity, the Bank conducts daily open market operations to buy or sell
short-term government ﬁxed-income instruments. If this is not sufﬁcient to meet
liquidity needs, the Bank would also conduct additional overnight operations.
Important Characteristics of the British Pound
■GBPUSD is very liquid . The GBPUSD is one of the most liquid currencies in the
world, with 6% of all currency trading involving the British pound as either
the base or counter currency. It is also one of the three most liquid currencies
CURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)227alongside EURUSD and USDJPY. One of the reasons for the currency’s liquidity
is the country’s highly developed capital markets. Many foreign investors seeking
opportunities other than the United States have sent their funds to the United
Kingdom for investment. In order to create these transactions, foreigners will
need to sell their local currency and buy British pounds.
■GBP has three names . The UK’s currency has three names: the British pound,
sterling, and cable. All of these are used interchangeably.
■GBP is laden with speculators . At the time of publication, the British pound has one
of the highest interest rates among the developed nations. Although Australia
and New Zealand have higher interest rates, their ﬁnancial markets are not as
developed as that of the United Kingdom. As a result, many investors who already
have positions or are interested in initiating new carry trades positions frequently
use the GBP as the lending currency and will go long the pound against currencies
such as the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. A carry trade involves
buying or lending a currency with a higher interest and selling or borrowing a
currency with a lower interest rate. In recent years, carry trades have increased in
popularity, which helped spur demand for the British pound. However, should the
interest rate yield differential bet ween the pound and other currencies narrow,
an exodus of carry traders will increase volatility in the British pound.
■Interest rate differentials between Gilt s and foreign bonds ar e closely followed . Interest rate
differentials between UK Gilts—U.S. Tr easuries and UK Gilts and German Bunds
are widely watched by FX market participants. Gilts versus Treasuries can be a
barometer of GBPUSD ﬂows, while Gilts versus Bunds can be used as a barometer
for EURGBP ﬂows. More speciﬁcally, these interest rate differentials indicate how
much premium yield UK ﬁxed-income assets are offering over U.S. and European
(German Bunds are usually used as a barometer for European yield) ﬁxed-income
assets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders with indications of potential
capital ﬂow or currency movements, as global investors are always shifting their
capital in search of the assets with the highest yields. The United Kingdom can
provide these yields with the safety of having the same credit stability as the United
States.
■Euro sterling futures can give indications for interest rate movements .S i n c et h eU K
interest rate or bank repo rate is the primary tool used in monetary policy, it is
important to keep abreast of potential changes to the interest rate. Comments
from government ofﬁcials is one way to gauge biases for potential rate changes,
but the Bank of England is one of the only central banks that requires members
of the Monetary Policy Committee to publish their speciﬁc voting records.
This personal accountability indicates that comments by individual committee
members represent their own opinions and not that of the BoE. Therefore,
it is necessary to look for other indication of potential BoE rate movements.
Three-month euro sterling futures reﬂect market expectations on euro sterling

interest rates three months into the future. These contracts are also useful in
predicting UK interest rate changes, which will ultimately affect the ﬂuctuations
of the GBPUSD. Figure 28.1 illustrates 10 year performance of GBP-USD.
■Comments on euro by UK politicians will impact the euro . Any speeches, remarks
(especially from the Prime Minister or Treasury Chancellor), or polls in regards
to the euro will impact currency trade. Indication of adoption of the euro tends
to put downward pressure on GBP, while further opposition to euro entry will
typically boost the GBP. Reason being that in order for the GBP to come in line
with the euro, interest rates would have to decline and monetary policy would
have to be subjected to a foreign entity. A decrease in the interest rate would
induce carry trade investors to close their positions or sell pounds. The GBPUSD
would also decline because of the uncertainties involved with Euro adoption. The
UK economy is performing very well under the direction of its current monetary
authority. The EMU is currently encountering many difﬁculties with member
countries breaching EMU criteria. With one monetary authority dictating 19
countries (plus UK would be 20), the EMU has yet to prove that they have
developed a monetary policy suitable for all member states.
■GBP has positive correlation with energy prices . The UK houses some of the largest
energy companies in the world, including British Petroleum. Energy production
represents 10% of GDP. As a result, the British pound tends to have a positive
correlation with energy prices. Speciﬁcally, since many members of the EU
import oil from the United Kingdom, as oil prices increase, they will, in turn,
have to buy more pounds to fund their energy purchases. In addition, rises in the
price of oil will also beneﬁt the earnings of the nations’ energy exporters.
CURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)229■GBP crosses . Although the GBP/USD is a more liquid currency than EURGBP,
EURGBP is typically the leading gauge for GBP strength. The GBPUSD currency
pair tends to be more sensitive to U.S. developments, while EURGBP is a
more pure fundamental pound trade since Europe is Britain’s primary trade
and investment partner. However, both currencies are naturally interdependent,
which means movements in the EURGBP can affect movements in the GBPUSD.
The reverse is also true—that is, movements in GBPUSD will also affect trading
in EURGBP. Therefore, it is important for pound traders to be consciously aware
of the trading behavior of both currency pairs. The EURGBP rate should be
exactly equal to the EURUSD divided by the GBPUSD rate. Small differences in
these rates are often exploited by market participants and quickly eliminated.
■Important Economic Indicators
for the United Kingdom
All of the following indicators are important for the United Kingdom. However,
since the United Kingdom is primarily a service-oriented economy, it is particularly
important to pay attention to service sector data.
PMIs
Every month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the manufacturing,
service, and construction sectors. These numbers are extremely market moving
because they provide the most up-to-date information on how each of the economies
is performing in the current month and not how the economies performed
the previous month, like many other reports. However since the reports are for the
current period, they are usually subject to revisions, so the euro will move on the
preliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents expansion, and a
reading below 50 represents contraction. For the United Kingdom, the PMI services
index is the most important, along with the composite index, which aggregates how
the manufacturing and service sector are performing.
Employment Situation
The employment report is a monthly survey of the labor market conducted by
the Ofﬁce of National Statistics. The obj ectives of the survey are to divide the
working-age population into three separate classiﬁcations (employed, unemployed,
and not in the labor force), and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of
these categories. Data from the survey provide market participants with information
on major labor market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors,
hours worked, labor force participation, and unemployment rates. The timeliness
of the survey makes it a closely watched s tatistic by the currency market as it is a
good barometer of the strength of the UK economy and an important input into
monetary policy.
CURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)230Retail Sales
The key to growth is consumer spending, and for this reason, the retail sales report
is also extremely market moving. The Retail Sales Index measures the total goods
sold by a sampling of retail stores over the course of a month. This index is used as
a gauge of consumer consumption and consumer conﬁdence. While retail sales can
be quite volatile due to seasonality, it is one of the most important indicators on the
health of the economy, along with a key input for GDP.
Consumer or Retail Price Index
CPI or RPI is a measure of the change in prices of a basket of consumer goods. The
markets however focus on the underlying RPI or RPI-X, which excludes mortgage
interest payments. The RPI-X is closely watc hed as the treasury sets inﬂation targets
for the BoE, currently deﬁned as 2.5% annual growth in RPI-X.
GDP
GDP is a quarterly report conducted by the Bureau of Statistics. GDP is a measure
of the total production and consumption of goods and services in the UK. GDP
is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses, government, and
net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert output measured
at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used to gauge where in
the business cycle the United Kingdom ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is perceived
as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or weak
growth.
Industrial Production
The industrial production (IP) index measures the change in output in the United
Kingdom of manufacturing; mining and quarrying; and electricity, gas, and water
supply. Output refers to the physical quantity of items produced, unlike sales value,
which combines quantity and price. The index covers the production of goods and
power for domestic sales in the United Kingdom and for export. Because IP is
responsible for close to a quarter of gross domestic product, IP is widely watched as
it can provide good insight into the current state of the economy.
UK Housing Starts
Housing starts measures the number of residential building construction projects
that have begun during any particular month. This is important for the United
Kingdom as the housing market is the primary industry that sustains the economy.
231CHAPTER 29
Currency Proﬁle:
Swiss Franc (CHF)
■Broad Economic Overview
Switzerland is the twentieth largest economy in the world, with a GDP valued at
over US$685 billion as of 2014. Although the economy is relatively small, it is one of
the wealthiest in the world on a GDP per capita basis. The country is prosperous and
technologically advanced with economic and political stability that rivals many larger
economies. The country’s prosperity stems primarily from technological expertise
in manufacturing, tourism, and banking. More speciﬁcally, Switzerland is known for
their chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, machinery, precision instruments,
watches, and a ﬁnancial system historically known for protecting the conﬁdentiality
of its investors. This coupled with the country’s lengthy history of political neutrality
earned Switzerland the Swiss franc safe haven status and as a direct result of that,
it is the one world’s most popular destinations for offshore capital. Even when the
central bank introduced a temporary 1.20 EURCHF peg and lowered interest rates
to negative levels, Switzerland stil l managed to attract safe haven ﬂows.
It is estimated that Switzerland holds over US$2 trillion in offshore assets as of
2014 and attracts over 35% of the world’s private wealth management business.
A large and highly advanced banking and insurance industry has developed to support
this demand, and the sector employs over 50% of the population and comprises over
70% of total GDP. Since Switzerland’s ﬁnancial industry thrives on its safe haven
status and renowned conﬁdentiality, capital ﬂows tend to drive the economy during
times of global risk aversion, while trade ﬂows drive the economy in a risk-seeking
CURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)232environment. Trade ﬂows are extremely important, with nearly two thirds of all
trade conducted with Europe. With this in mind, Switzerland’s most important
trading partners a re the following:
Leading Export Markets
1. Germany
2. India
3. United States
4. Hong Kong
5. France
Leading Import Sources
1. Germany
2. Italy
3. United States
4. France
5. China
Traditionally, Switzerland has a strong trade and current account surplus that
lends support to the currency. Most of the surplus can be attributed to the large
amount of foreign direct investment into the country, in seek of safety of capital,
despite the low to negative yields offered by Switzerland.
■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Swiss
National Bank
Monetary policy in Switzerland is determined by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). They
are a completely independent authority with a three-person committee responsible
for determining monetary policy. This committee consists of a chairman, a vice
chairman, and one other (member) who constitute the Governing Board of the
SNB. Due to the small size of the committee, all decisions are based on a consensus
vote. The Board reviews monetary policy at least once a quarter, but decisions on
monetary policy can be made and announced at any point in time. Unlike most other
central banks, the SNB does not set one ofﬁcial interest rate target, but instead sets
a target range for their three-month Swiss Libor rate.
Central Bank’s Goals
In December of 1999, the SNB shifted from focusing on monetary targets (M3) to an
inﬂation target of less than 2% inﬂation per year. This measure is taken based on the
national consumer price index. Monetary targets still remain important indicators
CURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)233and are closely watched by the central bank, because they provide information on
the long-term inﬂation. This new inﬂation focus also increases the central bank’s
transparency. In their mandate, they have clearly stated, ‘‘Should inﬂation exceed
2% in the medium term, the National Bank will tend to tighten its monetary stance.’’
If there is danger of deﬂation, the National Bank would loosen monetary policy. The
SNB also closely monitors exchange rates, as excessive strength in the Swiss franc
can cause inﬂationary conditions. This is especially true in environments of global
risk aversion, as capital ﬂows into Switzerland increases signiﬁcantly during those
times. As a result, the SNB typically favors a weak franc, and is not hesitant to use
intervention as liquidity tool. SNB ofﬁcials intervene in the franc using a variety of
methods including verbal remarks on liquidity, money supply, and the currency.
Their Tools
The most commonly used tools by the SNB to implement monetary policy include
the following.
Target Interest Rate Range
Traditionally, the SNB implements monetary policy by setting a target range for
their three-month interest rate known as the Swiss Franc Libor rate. According
to the SNB, ‘‘The Libor is a reference inte rest rate in the interbank market for
unsecured loans.’’ It is a trimmed mean of the rates charged by 12 leading banks and
is published daily by the British Bankers’ Association. The National Bank publishes
its target range regularly. As a rule, this range extends over 1 percentage point,
and the SNB generally aims to keep the Libor in the middle of the range. The SNB
undertakes quarterly economic and monetary assessments at which it reviews its
monetary policy. If circumstances so require, it will also adjust the Libor target
range in between these quarterly assessments. It sets out the reasons for its decisions
in press releases.
Open Market Operations
Repo transactions are the SNB’s major monetary policy instrument. A repo
transaction involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider
(lender), while agreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity
at a later date. This structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker
must pay the cash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short
maturities ranging from one day to a few weeks. The SNB uses these repo transactions
to manipulate undesirable moves in the three-month Libor rate. To prevent increases
in the three-month Libor rate above the SNB’s target, the bank would supply the
commercial banks with additional liquidity through repo transactions at lower repo
rates, and in essence create additional liquidity. Conversely, the SNB can reduce
liquidity or induce increases in the three-month Libor rate by increasing repo rates.
CURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)234In addition to the quarterly monetary policy decision, the SNB publishes a
Quarterly Bulletin with a detailed assessment of the current state of the economy
and a review of monetary policy. A Monthly Bulletin is also published containing a
short review of economic developments. These reports are important to watch, as
they may contain information on changes in the SNB’s assessment of economy and
guidance on monetary policy.
1.20 EUR/CHF Peg Implementation and Abandonment
Few would have expected that one of the seminal developments in the forex market
was the Swiss National Bank’s decision to implement and later abandon its 1.20
EURCHF peg. This decision transformed the foreign exchange industry, bankrupted
many brokers, and led to tighter regulations across the globe. Faced with a high level
of uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued currency and deﬂation risks
in 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At
the time, it pledged to sell francs in an unlimited quantity to maintain the peg. The
goal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping the gain in the franc. However,
in January 2015, the prospect of quantitative easing from the European Central
Bank pushed the SNB to abandon the peg. It also accumulated signiﬁcant foreign
exchange reserves that irritated critics, but more importantly, the franc became less
overvalued through the years, giving the SNB fewer reasons to maintain the peg.
SNB’s decision was a complete surprise, and caused a 30% drop in EURCHF in
a single day. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and
experienced massive losses as a result.
■Important Characteristics of the Swiss Franc
■Safe haven status . This is perhaps the most unique characteristic of the Swiss franc.
Switzerland’s safe haven status is continually stressed because this and the secrecy
of the banking system are the key advantages of Switzerland. The Swiss franc
moves primarily on external events rather than domestic economic conditions.
That is, as mentioned earlier, due to its political neutrality, the franc is considered
the world’s premier safe haven currency. Therefore, in times of global instability
and/or uncertainty, investors tend to be more concerned with capital retention
than appreciation. At such times, funds will ﬂow into Switzerland, which would
cause the Swiss franc to appreciate regardless of whether growth conditions are
favorable.
■Swiss franc is closely correlated with gold . Switzerland is the world’s third largest
ofﬁcial holder of gold. In the past, a Swiss constitutional mandate required the
currency to be backed 40% with gold reserves. The mandate is now removed
but the positive correlation between the Swiss franc and gold remains because
CURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)235the relationship has been engrained into the minds of forex traders; therefore,
both gold and the Swiss franc are perceived as safe haven instruments. Before the
SNB abandoned the EURCHF 1.20, Swiss franc had an 80% positive correlation
with gold. These days, the correlation is still there but in a smaller magnitude.
Generally speaking, if the price of gold appreciates, the Swiss franc has a high
likelihood of rising in value. In addition, since gold is also viewed as the ultimate
safe haven form of money, both gold and the Swiss franc beneﬁt during periods
of global economic and geopolitical uncertainty.
■Carry trades effects . With one of the lowest interest rates in the industrialized world,
over the past few years, the Swiss franc has become one of the most popular
funding currencies for carry trades. As mentioned in this book, the popularity of
carry trades has increased signiﬁcantly over the past two decades, as investors are
actively seeking high yield. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency
with a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest
rate. With CHF having one of the lowest interest rates of all industrialized
countries, it is one of the primary currencies sold or borrowed in carry trades.
This results in the need to sell CHF against a higher yielding currency. Carry
trades are typically done in cross-currencies such as GBPCHF or AUDCHF, but
these trades can impact both EURCHF and USDCHF. The unwinding of carry
trades involves the need for investors to buy back the Swiss franc.
■Interest rate differentials between euro Swiss futures and foreign interest rate futures are
closely followed . One of the favorite indicators of professional Swiss franc traders
is the interest rate differential bet ween three-month euro Swiss futures and
eurodollar futures. These differentials can provide guidance on potential money
ﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield U.S. ﬁxed-income assets are
offering over Swiss ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides
traders with indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always
looking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry
traders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate
differentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.
■Potential changes in banking regulations . Over the past few years members of the
European Union have been exerting signiﬁcant pressure on Switzerland to relax
the conﬁdentiality of their banking system and to increase transparency of their
customers’ accounts. The European Union is pressing this issue because of its
active measures to persecute EU tax evaders. This should be a concern for many
years to come. However, this is a difﬁcult decision for Switzerland to make because
the conﬁdentiality of their customers’ accounts represents the core strength of
their banking system. The EU has threatened to impose severe sanctions on
Switzerland if they do not comply with their proposed measures. Both countries
are currently working to negotiate an equitable resolution. Any news or talk of
CURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)236changing banking regulations will impact both Switzerland’s economy and the
Swiss franc.
■Mergers and acquisition activity . Switzerland’s primary industry is banking and
ﬁnance. In this industry, merger and acquisition activities (M&A) are very
common, especially as consolidation continues in the overall industry. As a result,
these M&A activities can have signiﬁcant impact on the Swiss franc. If foreign
ﬁrms purchase Swiss banks or insurance companies, they will need to buy Swiss
francs and in turn, sell their local currency. If Swiss banks purchase foreign ﬁrms,
they would need to sell Swiss francs and buy the foreign currency. Either way,
it is important for Swiss franc traders to frequently watch for notices on M&A
activity involving Swiss ﬁrms.
■Trading behavior, cross currency characteristics . The EURCHF is the most commonly
traded currency for traders who want to participate in CHF movements. USDCHF
is less frequently traded because of its greater illiquidity and volatility. However,
day traders may tend to favor USDCHF over EURCHF because of its volatile
movements. In actuality, the USDCHF is a synthetic currency derived from
EURUSD and EURCHF because more tra nsactions are done between the euro
and Swiss franc. Market makers or professional traders tend to use those pairs as
leading indicators for trading USDCHF or to price the current USDCHF level
when the currency pair is illiquid. Theoretically, the USDCHF rate should be
exactly equal to the EURCHF rate divided by EURUSD. Only during times of
unusual circumstances, such as the Iraq War, September 11, or the EURCHF peg,
will USDCHF develop a market of its own. Any small differences in these rates
are quickly exploited by market participants. Figure 29.1 highlights the 10 year
performance of EUR-CHF.
■Important Economic Indicators for Switzerland
Economic data from Switzerland tends to have limited impact on the currency, but
these are the most important pieces of Swiss data.
KoF Leading Indicators
The KoF leading indicators report is released by the Swiss Institute for Business
Cycle Research. This index is generally used to gauge the future health of the
Swiss economy. It contains six components: (1) change in manufacturers’ orders;
(2) the expected purchase plans of manufacturers over the next three months; (3)
the judgment of stocks in wholesale business; (4) consumer perception of their
ﬁnancial conditions; (5) backlog in the construction sector; and (6) orders backlog
for manufacturers.

The Consumer Price Index is calculated monthly, on the basis of retail prices paid in
Switzerland. In accordance with prevalent international practice, the commodities
covered are distinguished according to the consumption concept, which includes in
the calculation of the CPI of those goods and services that are part of the private
consumption aggregate according to the National Accounts. The basket of goods does
not include transfer expenditure such as direct taxation, social insurance contributions,
and health insurance premiums. The index is a key measure of inﬂation.
Gross Domestic Product
GDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services in
the Switzerland. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,
government, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert
output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used
to gauge where in the business cycle Switzerland ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is
perceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or
weak growth period.
Balance of Payments
Balance of payments is the collective term for the accounts of Swiss transactions
with the rest of the world. The current account is the balance of trade plus services
portion. BoP is an important indicator for Swiss traders, as Switzerland has always
kept a strong current account balance. Any changes to the current account, positive
or negative, could see substantial ﬂows.
Production Index (Industrial Production)
The production index is a quarterly measure of the change in the volume of industrial
production (or physical output by producers).
Retail Sales
Switzerland’s retail sales report is released on a monthly basis 40 days after the
reference month. The report is an important indicator of consumer spending habits
and is not seasonally adjusted.

Currency Proﬁle:
Japanese Yen (JPY)
■Economic Overview
Japan is the third largest economy in the world with GDP valued at over US$4.6
trillion in 2014 (behind the United States and China). If we count the European
Union as a whole, it would be considered the fourth largest economy. Japan is one of
the world’s largest exporters and is responsible for over US$690 billion in exports
per year. Manufacturing and exports of products such as electronics and cars are the
signature drivers of the economy, accounting for nearly 17% of GDP. As a result,
Japanese growth is extremely sensitive to the value of the currency. For many years,
Japan has maintained a trade surplus, but the earthquake followed by tsunami in
2011 turned the country into a net oil importer and created a long period of trade
imbalances, where oil imports exceeded exports in value. This began to change in
early 2015, when a weakening yen and falling oil prices helped to turn around trade
activity, returning Japan to a surplus nation. Having a trade surplus means that there
will be inherent demand for the Japanese yen even when interest rates are low
and there are structural deﬁciencies. Japan’s most important trade partners are the

■Abenomics
In the 1980s, Japan’s capital market was one of the most attractive markets for
international investors seeking investment opportunities in Asia. Japan had the most
developed capital markets in the region, and its banking system was considered to
be the one of the strongest in the world. At the time, the country was experiencing
above-trend economic growth and near zero inﬂation. This resulted in rapid
growth expectations, boosted asset prices, and rapid credit expansion, leading to the
development of an a sset bubble. Between 1990 and 1997, the asset bubble collapsed,
inducing a US$10 trillion decline in asset prices, with the fall in real estate values
accounting for nearly 65% of the total decline, nearly two years of national output.
This fall in asset prices sparked the banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early
1990s and developed into a full-blown systemic crisis in 1997 following the failure
of a number of high-proﬁle ﬁnancial institutions. Many of these banks and ﬁnancial
institutions extended loans to builders and real estate developers at the height of
the asset bubble in the 1980s, with land as collateral. A number of these developers
defaulted after the asset bubble collapse, leaving the country’s banks saddled with
bad debt and collateral worth sometimes 60% to 80% less than when the loans
were taken out. Due to the large size of these banking institutions and their role in
corporate funding, the crisis had profound effects on Japan and the global economy.
Enormous bad debts, falling stock prices, and a collapsing real estate sector crippled
Japan’s economy for more than two decades.
It was not until the rollout of Abenomics that the economy began to turn around.
When Shinzo Abe became prime minister for the second time in 2012, he rolled out
a three-pronged plan to stimulate growth and pull the economy out of stagnation
through monetary policy, ﬁscal policy, and economic growth strategies. This was
known as Abenomics . In the ﬁrst few weeks of the pr ogram, Abe announced a massive
stimulus package that involved signiﬁcant government spending and a strong dose
of quantitative easing. The effects were almost immediate, with the Japanese yen
falling signiﬁcantly across the board. Not soon after, the unemployment rate started
to fall and growth slowly returned.
CURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)241■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers
Monetary policy in Japan is determined by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). In 1998, the
Japanese government passed laws giving the BoJ operational independence from the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) and complete control over monetary policy. However,
despite the government’s attempts to decen tralize decision making, the MoF still
remains in charge of foreign exchange policy. The BoJ is responsible for executing
all ofﬁcial Japanese foreign exchange transactions at the direction of the MoF. The
Bank of Japan’s Policy Board consists of the BoJ governor, two deputy governors,
and six other members. Monetary policy meetings are held twice a month, with
brieﬁngs and press releases provided immediately. The BoJ also publishes a Monthly
Report issued by the Policy Board, and a Monthly Economic Report . These reports
are important to watch for changes in BoJ sentiment and signals of new monetary
or ﬁscal policy measures, as the government is constantly trying to develop fresh
initiatives to stimulate growth.
The MoF and the BoJ are very important institutions, and they both can
inﬂuence currency movements. Since the MoF is the director of foreign exchange
interventions, it is important to watch and keep abreast of the comments made
from MoF ofﬁcials. Being an export driven economy, the government tends to favor
a weaker currency. So if the Japanese yen appreciates signiﬁcantly or too rapidly
against the dollar, members of the BoJ and MoF will become increasingly vocal about
their concerns or disapproval in regards to its current level or recent movements.
These comments can affect how the yen moves, but if government ofﬁcials ﬂood the
market with comments and there is no follow-up action, the market would start
to become immune to these concerns. However, the MoF and BoJ have a lengthy
history of interventions in the currency markets to manipulate the value of the yen
value in Japan’s best interests, so their comments cannot be completely ignored.
The most popular tool that the BoJ uses to control monetary policy is open
market operations.
Open Market Operations
These activities are focused on controlling th e uncollateralized overnight call rate.
The Bank of Japan has maintained a zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) for some time
now, which means that the Bank of Japan cannot lower this rate further to stimulate
growth, consumption, or liquidity. Therefore, in order to maintain zero interest
rates, the BoJ has to manipulate liquidity through open market operations, targeting
zero interest on the overnight call rate. It manipulates liquidity by the outright
buying or selling of bills, repos, or Japanese government bonds. A repo transaction
CURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)242involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider (lender), while
agreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date.
This structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the
cash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities,
ranging from one day to a few weeks.
Important Characteristics of the JPY
■Proxy for Asian strength/weakness . Japan tends to be seen as a proxy for broad Asian
strength because the country has the largest GDP in Asia outside of China. With
the most developed capital markets, Japan was once the primary destination for
all investors who wanted access into the region. Japan also conducts a signiﬁcant
amount of trade with its Asian partners. As a result, economic problems or
political instability in Japan tend to spill over into the other Asian countries.
However, this spillover is not one-sided. Economic or political problems in
other Asian economies, particularly China, can also have dramatic impacts on
the Japanese economy and in turn movements in the Japanese yen. For example,
North Korean political instability poses a great risk to Japan and the Japanese yen
due to the country’s geographic proximity.
■Bank of Japan intervention practices . The BoJ and MoF are active participants in
the foreign exchange markets. That is, t hey have a lengthy history of entering
the FX markets if they are d issatisﬁed with the value of the Japanese yen. While
they have not intervened since 2011, they won’t be reluctant to do so if the
currency strengthens signiﬁcantly. As Japan is a very political economy, with
close ties between government ofﬁcials and principals of large private institutions,
the MoF can have a very narrow segment in mind when it decides to intervene
in the currency. Since the BoJ is such an active participant, it is very in tune
with the market movements and its participants. Periodically, the BoJ receives
information on large hedge fund positions from banks and likes to intervene when
speculators are on the other side of the market, allowing them to get the most
‘‘bang for the bucks.’’ The MoF and BoJ always considers three main factors
before intervention:
1.Amount of appreciation/depreciation in JPY —Intervention has historically
occurred when the yen moves by 7 or more yen in less than 6 weeks. Using
the USDJPY as a barometer, 7 yen would be equivalent to 700 pips, which
would represent a move from 120.00 to 127.00.
2.Current USDJPY rate —Historically, only 11% of all BoJ interventions that
were conducted to counter a strong JPY occurred above the 115 level.
3.Speculative positions— In order to maximize the impact of intervention, the
BoJ and MoF prefer to intervene when market participants hold massive
positions in the opposing direction because the ﬂow of stops will exacerbate
CURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)243the reversal in the currency pair. The CFTC provides a weekly report on
existing speculative positions that can be found at www.cftc.gov.
■JPY movements are sensitive to time . The Japanese yen can be particularly active
towards the end of Japan’s ﬁscal year (March 31), as exporters repatriate their
dollar denominated assets to window dress their balance sheets. This is particularly
important for Japanese banks because they need to rebuild their balance sheets
to meet FSA guidelines that require the banks to mark to market their security
holdings. In anticipation of the need for repatriation-related purchases, Japanese
yen speculators frequently bid the yen higher in attempt to take advantage of this
increased inﬂow. As a result, following ﬁscal year end, the Japanese yen tends to
have a bias toward depreciation as speculators close their positions.
Aside from the ﬁscal year end, time is also a factor on a day-to-day basis.
Unlike traders in London or New York who typically have lunch at their trading
desk, Japanese traders tend to take hour-long lunches, leaving only a junior trader
in the ofﬁce. On occasion, this can translate into additional volatility in the yen
during this period as the market becomes illiquid. In addition to this period, the
JPY tends to move fairly orderly during Japanese and London hours, unless there
are ofﬁcial comments or major surprises in economic data. During U.S. hours,
however, the JPY tends to have higher volatility, as U.S. traders are actively
engaging in dollar and yen positions.
■Stocks and bonds have a positive correlation with USDJPY . The Nikkei has a positive
correlation with USDJPY, which means that when the currency pair appreciating,
equities are generally on the rise as well. For Japan, the currency typically leads
equities because a weak yen is positive for the economy, but there can be times
when equities lead currencies. The spread between U.S. 10-year Treasury and
JGB yields is also very important for the currency. Typically, when the yield
spread is on the rise, we see USDJPY move higher, and when the yield spread
declines, it creates pressure on USDJPY. Figure 30.1 highlights the 10 year
performance of USDJPY.
■Carry trade effects . The popularity of carry trades has increased in recent years, as
investors are actively seeking high-yielding assets. With the Japanese yen having
the lowest interest rate of all industrialized countries, it is the primary currency
sold or borrowed in carry trades. The most popular carry trade currencies
included GBPJPY, AUDJPY, NZDJPY, and even USDJPY. Carry traders would
go short the Japanese yen against the higher yielding currencies. Unwinding of
carry trades as result of spread narrowing is typically beneﬁcial for the Japanese
yen, as the reversal process involves purchasing the yen and buying back other
currencies. Since there is so much demand to sell the yen for carry, in periods of
risk aversion, these trades can be unwound quickly creating a signiﬁcant rally in
the currency.
CURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)244■Important Economic Indicators for Japan
Since Japan is a manufacturing-oriented economy, manufacturing data tend to have
the most signiﬁcant impact on the yen. However, on a monthly basis, unless there is
a big surprise, Japanese data do not typically move the currency. The most inﬂuential
event risk is always the monetary policy announcement and trade balance. Aside
from that, these are the numbers to watch.
Tankan Survey
If there is one piece of Japanese data to follow, it should be the quarterly Tankan
Report. The Tankan is an economic survey of Japanese enterprises published four
times a year. The survey includes more than 9,000 enterprises, which are divided
into four major groups: large, small, and medium-sized companies, as well as
principal enterprises. The survey provides us with an overall impression of the
business climate in Japan and is widely watched and anticipated by foreign exchange
market participants.
Balance of Payments
The monthly balance of payments report provides investors with insight into Japan’s
international economic transactions that include goods, services, investment income,
and capital ﬂows. The current account side of BoJ can be used a good gauge of
international trade. Figures are released on a monthly and semiannual basis.
Employment
Employment ﬁgures are reported on a monthly basis by the Management and
Coordination Agency of Japan. The employment release measures the number of
jobs and unemployment rate for the country as a whole. The data are obtained
through a statistical survey of the current labor force. This release is a closely
watched economic indicator because of its timeliness and its importance as a leading
indicator of economic activity.
Industrial Production
The industrial production (IP) index measures trends in the output of Japanese
manufacturing, mining, and utilities companies. Output refers to the total quantity
of items produced. The index covers the production of goods for domestic sales
in Japan and for export. It excludes production in the agriculture, construction,
transportation, communication, trade, ﬁnance, and service industries; government
output; and imports. The IP index is then developed by weighting each component
according to its relative importance during this base period. Investors feel IP and

GDP
Gross domestic product (GDP) is a broad measure of the total production and
consumption of goods and services measured over quarterly and yearly periods in
Japan. GDP is measured by adding total expenditures by households, businesses,
government, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert
output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. Preliminary reports
are the most signiﬁcant for FX market participants.

Currency Proﬁle:
Australian Dollar
(AUD)
■Broad Economic Overview
Australia is the twelfth largest country in the world, with a gross domestic product
of approximately US$1.5 trillion. In Asia, it ranks as the third largest economy
in the region. On a relative basis, the economy is very small, only one-tenth
that of the United States and less than one-ﬁfth the size of China. However on a
per capita basis, Australia ranks right up there with many industrialized Western
European countries. Australia has a service-oriented economy with close to 70%
of GDP coming from industries such as ﬁnance, property, and business services.
However, the country has a trade deﬁcit, with manufacturing dominating the
country’s exporting activities. Rural and mineral exports account for over 60% of all
manufacturing exports and 12% of GDP. The economy is therefore highly sensitive
to changes in commodity prices. As a country heavily dependent on exports, the
pace of growth of Australia’s largest trade partners is extremely important because
downturns or rapid growth abroad can impact import and export demand. Here’s a
breakdown of Australia’s most important trading partners:
L a r g e s tE x p o r tM a r k e t s

2. Japan

4. United States
5. New Zealand
Largest Import Sources
1. China
2. United States
3. Japan
4. Singapore
5. Germany
As you can see, Australia’s number one trading partner is China. In fact, Chinese
demand represents a third of the country’s trade activity. In terms of products, the
Chinese are major importers of Australian iron ore, coal, natural gas, and gold.
Asia Pac is extremely important to Australia, as more than 70% of its exports are
destined for countries within the region. This makes Australia’s economy highly
sensitive to the performance of countries in the Asian Paciﬁc region. Hiccups in
China’s economy can have a signiﬁcant impact on Australia, not only in terms of
exporting activities but also on housing market activity. At the same time, growth in
China is positive for Australia’s economy. During the global ﬁnancial crisis, exports
to China helped shelter Australia from a major downturn. The relationship between
China and Australia is known as Sino-Australian relations. China has recently taken
steps to produce its own resources, and if this trend continues, it could dramatically
change the landscape of Australia’s economy.
■Monetary and Fiscal Policy
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is the central bank of Australia. The monetary
policy committee within the central bank consists of the governor (chairman), the
deputy governor (vice chairman), secretary to the treasurer, and six independent
members appointed by the government. Changes to monetary policy are made on
consensus within the committee.
Central Bank’s Goals
The RBA’s charter states t hat the mandate of the Reserve Bank Board is to focus
monetary and banking policy on ensuring:
1. The stability of the currency of Australia;
2. The maintenance of full employment in Australia; and
3. The economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia
CURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)249In order to achieve these objectives, the government has set an informal consumer
price inﬂation target of 2% to 3% per year. The RBA believes that the key to long-
term sustainable growth in the economy is to control inﬂation, which would preserve
the value of money. In addition, an inﬂation target provides a discipline for monetary
policy making and guidelines for private-sector inﬂation expectations. This also
increases the transparency of the banks’ activities. Should inﬂation or inﬂation
expectations exceed the 2% to 3% target, traders should know that it would raise
red ﬂags at the RBA and prompt the central bank to favor a tighter monetary policy
or, in the other words, further rate hikes.
Monetary policy decisions involve setting the interest rate on overnight loans
in the money market. Other interest rates in the economy are inﬂuenced by this
interest rate to varying degrees, so that the behavior of borrowers and lenders in
the ﬁnancial markets is affected by monetary policy (though not only by monetary
policy). Through these channels, monetary policy affects the economy in pursuit of
the goals just outlined.
Cash Rate
The cash rate is the RBA’s target rate for open market operations and is the rate
charged on overnight loans between ﬁnancial intermediaries. This means the cash
rate should have a close relationship with the prevailing money market interest rates.
Changes in monetary policy directly affect the interest rate structure of the ﬁnancial
system. They also affect sentiment in a currency. Figure 31.1 graphs the AUDUSD

FIGURE 31.1 AUDUSD vs. 10-Year Yield Spread
CURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)250against the interest rate differential between Australia and the United States between
2010 and 2015. There is clearly a positive c orrelation between the 10-year yield
spread and the currency. Between June 2014 and June 2015, for example, the yield
spread dropped from 1.5% to 0.5%, and thi s coincided with a drop in the AUDUSD
from 95 to 76 cents.
Maintaining the Cash Rate: Open Market Operations
The focus of daily open market operations is to keep the cash rate close to the target,
by managing money market liquidity provided to commercial banks. If the Reserve
Bank wishes to decrease the cash rate, it would increase supply of short-dated
repurchase agreements at a lower interest rate than the prevailing cash rate, which
would in essence decrease the cash rate. If the Reserve Bank wishes to increase
the cash rate, it would decrease supply of short-dated repurchase agreements,
which would increase the cash rate. A repurchase agreement involves a cash taker
(commercial bank) selling securities to a cash provider (RBA), while agreeing to
repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date. This structure
is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the cash provider
interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities, ranging from
one day to a few weeks.
Australia has had a ﬂoating exchange rate since 1983, and the Reserve Bank
of Australia may undertake foreign exchange market operations when the market
threatens to become excessively volatile or when the exchange rate is clearly
inconsistent with underlying economic fundamentals. The RBA monitors a trade-
weighted index (TWI), as well as the cross-rate with the U.S. dollar. Intervention
operations are invariably aimed at stabilizing market conditions rather than meeting
exchange rate targets.
Monetary Policy Meetings
The RBA meets every month (except for January), on the ﬁrst Tuesday of each
month, to discuss potential changes in monetary policy. Following each meeting, the
RBA issues a press release outlining justiﬁcations for its monetary policy changes.
If it leaves rates unchanged, no statement is published. The RBA also publishes a
monthly Reserve Bank Bulletin . The May and November issues of the Reserve Bank
Bulletin include the semiannual statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy. The
February, May, August, and November issues contain a Quarterly Report on the
Economy and Financial Markets. It is important to read these bulletins for signals on
potential monetary policy changes.
CURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)251Important Characteristics of the Australian Dollar
■Commodity linked currency . Historically, the Australian dollar has had a very strongly
correlation (approximately 80%) with commodity prices and, more speciﬁcally,
gold and iron ore prices. The correlation stems from the fact that Australia is
the world’s second largest gold producer and the world’s largest producer of
iron ore. Therefore, the price of iron ore and gold is extremely important to
Australia’s economy. However, unless there is a sharp movement in gold or
iron ore prices, it generally takes time for the AUDUSD to adjust to changes in
the price of commodities. Generally speaking, if commodity prices are strong,
inﬂationary fears start to appear, and the RBA would be inclined to raise rates to
curb inﬂation. However, this is a sensitive topic, as gold prices tend to increase
in times of global economic or political uncertainty. If the RBA increases rates
during those conditions, it leaves Australia more vulnerable to spillover effects.
■Carry trade effects . Australia has one of highest interest rates among the developed
countries. With a fairly liquid currency, the Australian dollar is one of the most
popular currencies to use for carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or
lending a currency with a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency
with a low interest rate. The popularity of the carry trade has contributed to the
57% rise of the Australian dollar aga inst the U.S. dolla r between 2001 and 2005.
While the carry trade suffered great ly in 2008, it came back strongly between
2009 and 2011. During this time, many foreign investors were looking for high
yield when equity investments offered minimal returns. However, carry trades
only last as long as the actual yield advantage remains. If global central banks
increase their interest rates and the positive interest rate differential between
Australia and other countries narro w, the AUDUSD could s uffer from an exodus
of carry traders.
■Drought effects . Since the majority of Australia’s exports are commodities, the
country’s GDP is highly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage
the country’s farming activities. For example, 2002 was a particularly difﬁcult
year for Australia, because the country was experiencing a severe drought. The
drought took an extreme toll on Australia’s farming activities, with dry conditions
hampering the economy throughout the twenty-ﬁrst century. This is important
because agriculture accounts for 3% of the country’s GDP. The RBA estimates
that the ‘‘decline in farm production could directly reduce GDP growth by
around 1 percentage point.’’ Aside from exporting activities, a drought also has
indirect effects on other aspects of Australia’s economy. Industries that supply and
service agriculture, such as the wholesale and transport sectors, as well as retail
CURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)252operations in rural farming areas, may also be negatively affected by a drought.
However, it is also important to note that the Australian economy has a history
of recovering strongly after a drought. The 1982–1983 drought ﬁrst subtracted
then subsequently added around 1% to 1 1∕2% to GDP growth. The 1991–1995
drought reduced GDP by around 1∕2to3∕4percentage points in 1991–1992 and
1994–1995, but the recovery boosted GDP by 3∕4percentage points.
■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of Australia
and the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries should
also be closely watched by Australian dollar traders. These differentials can be
good indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much premium
yield Australian dollar short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign
short-term ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders
with indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking
for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders
who enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials
between global ﬁxed-income assets.
■Important Economic Indicators for Australia
GDP
GDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services
in Australia. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,
government, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert
output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used
to gauge where in the business cycle Australia ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is
perceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth generally coincides with a
weak growth period.
CPI
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a basket
of goods and services, which account for a high proportion of expenditure by the
CPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide
range of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation, and
health. This is an important indicator to watch, as it is a key input for monetary
policy decisions.
Balance of Goods and Services
This number is a monthly measure of Australia’s international trade in goods and
services on a balance of payments basis. General merchandise imports and exports

Customs Service records. The current account is the balance of trade plus services.
Private Consumption
This is a national accounts measure that reﬂects current expenditure by households
and producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes purchases of
durable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure by persons
on the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by unincorporated
enterprises. This number is important to watch, as private consumption or consumer
consumption is the foundation for resilience in the Australian economy.
Producer Price Index
The Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average
changes in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI
tracks changes in prices for nearly every goods-producing industry in the domestic
economy, including agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries,
manufacturing, and mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally
adjusted ﬁnished goods PPI and how the index has reacted on an m/m, q/q, h/h
and y/y basis. Australia’s PPI data are released on a quarterly basis.

Currency Proﬁle:
New Zealand Dollar
(NZD)
■Broad Economic Overview
New Zealand is a very small economy with GDP valued at approximately
US$183 billion in 2013. In fact, there are less people living in New Zealand
than in New York City. It was once one of the most regulated countries within
the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), but over
the past two decades the country has been moving toward a more open, modern,
and stable economy. With the passing of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994, the
country is shifting from an agricultural farming community to one that seeks to
become a leading knowledge-based economy with high skills, high employment,
and high value-added production. This act sets legal standards that hold the govern-
ment formally responsible to the public for its ﬁscal performance. It also sets the
framework for the country’s macroeconomic policies. The following are the ﬁve
principles outlined under the Fiscal Responsibility Act:
1. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; by achieving surpluses on the
operating budget every year until such a level is reached.
2. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; and the government must ensure
that expenditure is lower than revenue.
CURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)2563. Sufﬁcient levels of Crown net worth must be achieved and maintained to guard
against adverse future events.
4. Reasonable taxation policies must be followed.
5. Fiscal risks facing the government must be prudently managed.
New Zealand also has highly developed manufacturing and services sectors,
with the agricultural industry driving the bulk of the country’s exports. The
economy is strongly trade-oriented, with exports of goods and services representing
approximately one third of GDP. Due to the small size of the economy and its
signiﬁcant trade activities, New Zealand is highly sensitive to global performance,
especially of its key Asian trading partners, Australia, China, United States, and Japan.
Together, Australia, China, and Japan represent 42% of New Zealand’s trading
activity. It is also extremely sensitive to exchange rate ﬂuctuations, particularly
against the Australian dollar. The fo llowing lists are a breakdown of the New
Zealand’s most important trading partners:

■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Reserve
Bank of New Zealand
Monetary policy in New Zealand is determined by the Reserve Bank (RBNZ).
The Monetary Policy Committee is an internal committee of bank executives who
review monetary policy on a weekly basis. Meetings to decide on changes to
monetary policy occur eight ti mes a year, or approximate ly every six weeks. Unlike
most other central banks, the decision for rate changes rests ultimately on the bank’s
governor. The current policy target agreements set by the minister and the governor
focus on maintaining policy stability and avoiding unnecessary instability in output,
interest rates, and the exchange rate. Price stability refers to maintaining the annual
CURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)257CPI inﬂation at 1.5%. If the RBNZ does not meet this target, the government has
the ability to dismiss the governor of the RBNZ. This is rarely done, but this serves
as a strong incentive for the RBNZ to meets its inﬂation target. The most common
tools used by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy changes are the following.
Ofﬁcial Cash Rate (OCR)
The Ofﬁcial Cash Rate is the rate set by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy.
The Bank lends overnight cash at 25 basis points above the OCR rate and receives
deposits or pays interest at 25 basis points below this rate. By controlling the cost
of liquidity for commercial banks, the RBNZ can inﬂuence the interest rates offered
to individuals and corporations. This effectively creates a 50 basis point corridor
that bounds the interbank overnight rate. The idea is then that banks offering funds
above the upper bound will attract few takers, because funds can be borrowed for
a lower cost from the RBNZ. Also, banks offering rates below the lower bound
will also attract few takers, because they are offering lower yields than the RBNZ.
The ofﬁcial cash rate is reviewed and manipulated with the goal of maintaining
economic stability.
Objectives for Fiscal Policy
Open market operations on the other hand are used to meet the cash target. The
cash target is the targeted amount of reserves held by registered banks. The RBNZ
prepares forecasts of daily ﬂuctuations on the cash target and will then use these
forecasts to determine the amount of funds to inject or withdraw in order to meet
the cash target. The following government objectives provide a guideline for ﬁscal
and monetary policy measures:
■Expenses : Expenses will average around 35% of GDP over the horizon used to
calculate contributions toward future New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) costs.
During the buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs, expenses plus contributions
will be around 35% of GDP. In the longer term, expenses less withdrawals to
meet NZS costs will be around 35% of GDP.
■Revenue : Raise sufﬁcient revenue to meet the operating balance objective. A
robust, broad-based tax system that raises revenue in a fair and efﬁcient way.
■Operating balance : Operating surplus on average over the economic cycle sufﬁcient
to meet the requirements for contributions toward future NZS costs and ensure
consistency with the debt objective.
■Debt: Gross debt below 30% of GDP on average over the economic cycle. Net
debt, which excludes the assets to meet future NZS costs, below 20% of GDP on
average over the economic cycle.
CURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)258■Net worth : Increase net worth consistent with the operating balance objective.
This will be achieved through a buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs.

■Important Characteristics of the New Zealand
Dollar
Strong Correlation with AUD—Competition with Australia
Australia is New Zealand’s largest trading partner. This coupled with their geographic
proximity and New Zealand’s high dependence on trade, creates strong ties between
the economies of the two countries. When the Australian economy is healthy and
Australian corporations increase their importing activities, New Zealand will be one
of the ﬁrst to beneﬁt. When it is weak, New Zealand suffers but in recent years
its sensitivity has diminished because of the country’s growing trade with China
and other nations. Nonetheless, 22% of trade is still conducted with Australia,
and this explains why there is a positive correlation between the two currencies.
Figure 32.1 shows how closely AUDUS D and NZDUSD have moved between 2005
and 2015.
Commodity-Linked Currency
New Zealand is an export driven economy with commodities representing over
40% of the country’s exports, and as a result the New Zealand dollar has a strong
correlation with commodity prices, particularly dairy. Fonterra is one of the world’s

CURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)259leading dairy producer and also largest company in New Zealand. Twice a month
the Global Dairy Trade will conduct an auction and if prices rise, it will be positive
for the New Zealand dollar. If prices fall, it will be negative for the currency
because it can mean reduced payout and proﬁt for dairy producers. The correlation
between Australian and New Zealand dollars also contributes to the NZD’s status as a
‘‘commodity linked’’ currency. Therefore, the New Zealand dollar’s correlation with
commodity prices is not only limited to its own trade activities. Therefore, as com-
modity prices increase, the Australian economy beneﬁts, translating into increased
activity in all aspects of the country’s operations, including trade with New Zealand.
Carry Trades
Of the industrialized countries, New Zealand tends to maintain the highest interest
rate as it needs to offer investors a higher yield to compensate for the risk of
investing in a small economy. This yield advantage along with its secure credit rating
has made the New Zealand dollar one of the most popular currencies to purchase
for carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high
interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. The
popularity of the carry trade has contributed to the rise of the New Zealand dollar in
an environment where many global investors are looking for opportunities to earn
high yield. However, this also makes the New Zealand dollar particularly sensitive
to changes in interest rates. That is, when the United States begins increasing their
interest rates, while New Zealand stays on hold or reduces their interest rates, the
carry advantage of the New Zealand dollar would narrow. In such situations, the
New Zealand dollar could come under pressure as speculators reverse their carry
trade positions.
Interest Rate Differentials
Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of New Zealand and the short
term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries are closely watched by
professional NZD traders. These differentials can be good indicators of potential
money ﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield NZD short-term ﬁxed-
income assets are offering over foreign short-term ﬁxed income assets, or vice versa.
This differential provides traders with indications of potential currency movements,
as investors are always looking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly
important to carry traders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive
interest rate differentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.
Population Migration
As mentioned earlier, New Zealand has a very small population, less than half of
New York City. Therefore, changes in migration can have signiﬁcant effects on the
CURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)260economy. Between 2013 an d 2014, the population of New Zealand increased by
78,800 people, which was the largest net migration in at least 90 years. Between
2011 and 2012, for example, the population only grew by 26,400 people. Although
these absolute numbers appear small, it is fairly signiﬁcant for New Zealand because
of the size of the population. In fact, this strong population migration into New
Zealand has contributed signiﬁcantly to the performance of the economy, because
as the population increases, the demand for household goods increases, leading to
an increase in overall consumer consumption.
Drought Effects
Since the bulk of New Zealand’s exports are commodities, the country’s GDP is
highly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage the country’s farming
activities. In 2013, droughts cost the country over $1.3 billion. In addition, droughts
are also very frequent in Australia, New Zealand’s largest trading partner, and when
they occur it can have a negative impact on the New Zealand economy.
■Important Economic Indicators for New Zealand
New Zealand does not release economic indicators often; however, when they do,
the following items are the most important:
Gross Domestic Product
GDP is a quarterly measure of the total production and consumption of goods and
services in New Zealand. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households,
businesses, government, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used
to convert output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. This data are
used to gauge where in the business cycle New Zealand ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often
is perceived inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or
weak growth period.
Consumer Price Index
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a
‘‘basket’’ of goods and services that account for a high proportion of expenditure by
the CPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide
range of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation,
and health. This is an important indicator to watch, as monetary policy changes are
highly inﬂuenced by this index as it is a measure of inﬂation.

CURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)262Balance of Goods and Services
New Zealand’s Balance of Payments statements are records of the value of New
Zealand’s transactions in goods, services, income, and transfers with the rest of the
world, and the changes in New Zealand’s ﬁnancial claims on (assets), and liabilities
to, the rest of the world. New Zealand’s International Investment Position statement
shows, at a particular point in time, the stock of a country’s international ﬁnancial
assets and international ﬁnancial liabilities.
Retail Sales Ex Inﬂation
Credit card spending numbers are released for New Zealand on a monthly basis but
the retail sales data is quarterly on an ex inﬂation basis. This measure tracks the
resale of new and used goods to the public for personal or household consumption.
It is also an important input into GDP.
Producer Price Index
The Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes
in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks
changes in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,
including agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,
and mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished
goods PPI and how the index has reacted on a m/m, q/q, h/h, and y/y basis. New
Zealand’s PPI data is released on a quarterly basis.

■Broad Economic Performance
Canada is the world’s eleventh largest country with GDP valued at US$1.8 trillion as
of 2014. As a resource-based economy, the country’s early economic development
hinged on the development, exploitation, and exports of natural resources. It is
now the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold. However, in actuality,
nearly two-thirds of the country’s GDP comes from the service sector, which also
employs three out of four Canadians. The strength in the service sector is partly
attributed to the trend by businesses to subcontract a large portion of their services.
This may include a manufacturing company subcontracting delivery services to a
transportation company. Despite this, manufacturing and resources are still very
important for the Canadian economy, as it represents over 25% of the country’s
exports and is a primary source of income for a number of provinces.
The Canadian economy started to advance with the depreciation of its currency
against the U.S. dollar and the Free Trade Agreement that came into effect in January
1989. This agreement eliminated almost all trade tariffs between the United States
and Canada. As a result, Canada now exports over 85% of its goods to the United
States. Further negotiations to incorporate Mexico created the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect on January 1994. This more advanced
CURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)264treaty eliminated most tariffs on trading b etween all three countries. Canada’s close
trade relationship with the United States makes it particularly sensitive to the health
of the U.S. economy. If the U.S. economy sputters, demand for Canadian exports
would suffer. The same is true for the opposite scenario; if U.S. economic growth
is robust, Canadian exports will beneﬁt. In the past decade, trade with China has
also increased signiﬁcantly, rising in the ranks from the ﬁfth to the second most
important trade partner for Canada. The following is a breakdown of Canada’s key
export and import markets:

■Monetary and Fiscal Policy
The Governing Council of the Bank of Canada is the board that is responsible for
setting Canadian monetary policy. This council consists of seven members: the
governor and six deputy governors. The Bank of Canada meets approximately eight
times per year to discuss changes in monetary policy. They also release a monthly
monetary policy update every quarter, but the rate decision itself is the big market
mover for the currency.
Central Bank Goals
The Bank of Canada’s primary focus is on maintaining the ‘‘integrity and value of
the currency,’’ and this involves ensuring pri ce stability. Price stability is maintained
by adhering to an inﬂation target currently set by the Department of Finance at
1% to 3%. The Bank believes that high inﬂation can damage the functioning of the
economy. In their opinion, low inﬂation on the other hand equates to price stability,
which can help to foster sustainable long-term economic growth. The BoC controls
inﬂation through short-term interest rates. If inﬂation is above the target, the Bank
will apply tighter monetary conditions. If it is below the target, the Bank will loosen
CURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)265monetary policy. Overall, the central bank has done a pretty good job of keeping
the inﬂation target within the band since 1998.
The Bank measures monetary conditions using its Monetary Conditions Index,
which is a weighted sum of changes in the 90-day commercial paper rate and G-10
trade-weighted exchange rates. The weight of the interest rate versus the exchange
rate is 3 to 1, which is the affect of a chan ge in interest rates on the exchange rate
based on historical studies. This means that a 1% increase in short-term interest
rates is the same as a 3% appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate. To
change monetary policy, the BoC manipulates the Bank Rate, which can in turn
affect the exchange rate. If the currency appreciates to undesirable levels, the BoC
can decrease interest rates to offset the rise. If it depreciates, the BoC can raise rates.
However, interest rate changes are not used for the purposes of manipulating the
exchange rate. Instead, they are used to control inﬂation but an excessively strong
currency and lower inﬂationary pressures can accelerate the changes. The following
are the most commonly used tools by the BoC to implement monetary policy.
Bank Rate
The Bank Rate is the main rate used to control inﬂation. This is the rate of interest
that the Bank of Canada charges to commercial banks. Changes to this rate will affect
other interest rates, including mortgage rates and prime rates charged by commercial
banks. Therefore, changes to this rate will ﬁlter into the overall economy.
Open Market Operations
The Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) is the framework for the Bank of Canada’s
implementation of monetary policy. It is through this framework that Canada’s
commercial banks borrow and lend overnight money to each other in order to fund
their daily transactions. The LVTS is an electronic platform through which these
ﬁnancial institutions conduct large transactions. The interest rate charged on these
overnight loans is called the overnight rate or bank rate. The BoC can manipulate the
overnight rate by offering to lend at rates lower or higher than the current market
rate if the overnight lending rate is trading above or below the target banks.
On a regular basis, the bank releases a number of publications that are important to
follow. This includes a biannual Monetary Policy Report that contains an assessment of
the current economic environment and implications for inﬂation and a quarterly Bank
of Canada Review that includes economic commentary, featured articles, speeches by
members of the Governing Council, and important announcements.
Important Characteristics of the Canadian Dollar
■Commodity linked currency . As the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold,
Canada’s economy is highly dependent on commodities. This creates a strong
positive correlation between the Canadian dollar and oil prices. Generally
CURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)266speaking, when oil prices rise, it beneﬁts domestic producers and increases their
income from exports. However at the same time, strong commodity prices can
hurt growth abroad; so while rising oil prices are initially positive for Canada,
the negative impact on global growth could lead to a decline in demand over the
medium term. On the ﬂip side, falling oil prices are negative for the Canadian
dollar; but if prices remain low and global growth beneﬁts, it can eventually
neutralize the negative impact.
■Strong correlation with the United States . Since the 1980s, Canada has been running
merchandise trade surpluses with the United States and now approximately 77%
of Canadian exports are bound for the Untied States. This heavy reliance on U.S.,
demand makes Canada extremely sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy. As the
U.S. economy accelerates, trade increases with Canadian companies, lifting overall
economic activity. However, as the U.S. economy slows, the Canadian economy
will be hurt signiﬁcantly as U.S. companies reduce their importing activities.
■Mergers and acquisitions . Due to the proximity of the United States and Canada,
cross-border mergers and acquisitions are very common, as companies worldwide
strive for globalization. These mergers and acquisitions lead to money ﬂowing
between the two countries, which ulti mately impacts the currencies. In 2001,
the signiﬁcant U.S. acquisition of Canadian energy companies infused US$25
billion into Canada. This led to a strong rally in USDCAD, as the U.S. companies
needed to sell USD and buy CAD to pay for their acquisitions. Any similar type
of M&A ﬂow in the future will also have a signiﬁcant but short-term impact on
the Canadian dollar.
■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of
Canada and the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries
are closely watched by professional Canadian dollar traders. These differentials
can be good indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much
premium yield Canadian short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign
short-term ﬁxed-income assets, and vice versa. This differential provides traders
with indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking
for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders
who enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials
between global ﬁxed-income assets.
■Carry trades . A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high
interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. When
Canada has a higher interest rate than th e United States, the short USDCAD carry
trade becomes more attractive; but if th e United States emba rks on a tightening
campaign or Canada lowers rates, the positive interest rate differential between
the Canadian dollar and other currencies would narrow. In such situations, the
Canadian dollar could come under pressure if the speculators begin to exit out of
their carry trades.
CURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)267■Important Economic Indicators for Canada
Canadian economic reports can have a signiﬁcant impact on the currency. Here are
a handful of the most important releases.
Canadian Employment
Every month, Canada releases its labor market report and this report provides more
details than that of the United States. Job growth is expressed as net job growth and
then split into full- and part-time hirers. Generally speaking, the market prefers that
the bulk of job growth is full time, because it represents real long-term employment
and not short-term hires that can be laid off at any time. The unemployment rate is
also released, and the number of unemployed persons is expressed as a percentage
of the labor force.
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
The monthly consumer price report measures the average rate of increase in prices.
When economists speak of inﬂation as an economic problem, they generally mean
a persistent increase in the general price level over a period of time, resulting in a
decline in a currency’s purchasing power. Inﬂation is often measured as a percentage
increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Canada’s inﬂation policy, as set out
by the federal government and the Bank of Canada, aims to keep inﬂation within
a target range of 1% to 3%. If the rate of inﬂation is 10% a year, $100 worth of
purchases last year will, on average, cost $110 this year. At the same inﬂation rate,
those purchases will cost $121 next year, and so on.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
The gross domestic product measures the total value of all goods and services
produced within Canada during a given year. It is a measure of the income generated
by production within Canada. GDP is also referred to as economic output. To
avoid counting the same output more than once, GDP includes only ﬁnal goods
and services—not those that are used to make another product. For example, GDP
would not include the wheat used to make bread, but would include the bread itself.
Trade Balance
The balance of trade is a statement of a country’s trade in goods (merchandise) and
services. It covers trade in products such as manufactured goods, raw materials, and
agricultural goods, as well as travel and transportation. The balance of trade is the
difference between the value of the goods and services that a country exports and
the value of the goods and services that it imports. If a country’s exports exceed its
imports, it has a trade surplus and the trade balance is said to be positive. If imports
CURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)268
FIGURE 33.1 USDCAD 10-Year Chart
Source: eSignal
exceed exports, the country has a trade deﬁcit, and its trade balance is said to be
negative.
Retail Sales
Retail sales is a monthly national accounts measure that calculates current expenditure
by households and producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes
purchases of durable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure
by persons on the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by
unincorporated enterprises. Stronger consumer spending is positive for Canada’s
economy and, in turn, the Canadian dollar, whereas weaker consumer spending is
negative for Canada’s economy and currency.
Producer Price Index
The Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes
in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks
changes in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,
including agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,
and mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished
goods PPI and how the index has reacted on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.
