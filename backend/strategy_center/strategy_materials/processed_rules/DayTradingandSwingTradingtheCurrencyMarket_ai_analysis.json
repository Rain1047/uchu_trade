Traditionally, it is the platform through which governments, businesses,\ninvestors, travelers, and other interested parties convert or ‘‘exchange’’ currency.\nAt its most fundamental level, the foreign exchange market is an over-the-counter\n(OTC) market with no central exchange and clearing house where orders are\nmatched. FX dealers and market makers around the world are linked to each other\naround-the-clock via telephone, computer, and fax, creating one cohesive market.\nThrough the years, this has changed with many institutions offering exchange traded\nFX instruments, but all of the prices are still derived from the underlying or spot\nforex market.\nIn the past two decades, foreign exchange, also known as forex orFX,became\navailable to trade by individual retail investors, and this access caused the market\nto explode in popularity. In the early 2000s, the Bank of International Settlements\nreported a 57% increase in volume between Ap ril 2001 and 2004. At the time more\nthan $1.9 trillion were changing hands on a daily basis. After the ﬁnancial crisis in\n2008, the pace of growth eased to a still- respectable 32% between 2010 and 2013,\nbut the actual volume that changed hands was signiﬁcantly larger at an average of\n$5.3 trillion per day. To put this into perspective, it is 50 times greater than the\ndaily trading volume of the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ combined.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET2While the growth of the retail foreign exchange market contributed to this surge\nin volume, an increase in volatility over the past few years also made investors\nmore aware of how currency movements can impact the equity and bond markets.\nIf stocks, bonds, and commodity traders want to make more educated trading\ndecisions, it is important for them to also follow forex movements. What follows\nare some of the examples of how currency ﬂuctuations impacted stock and bond\nmarket movements in past years.\n■EURUSD and Corporate Proﬁtability\nFor stock market traders, particularly those who invest in European corporations that\nexport a tremendous amount of goods to the United States, monitoring exchange\nrates are essential to predicting earnings and corporate proﬁtability. Throughout 2003\nand 2004, European manufacturers complained extensively about the rapid rise in the\neuro and the weakness in the U.S. dollar. The main culprit for the dollar’s selloff at\nthe time was the country’s rapidly growing trade and budget deﬁcits. This caused the\nEURUSD exchange rate to surge, which took a signiﬁcant toll on the proﬁtability of\nEuropean corporations because a higher exchange rate makes the goods of European\nexporters more expensive to U.S. consumers. In 2003, inadequate hedging shaved\napproximately EUR$1 billion euros from Volkswagen’s proﬁts, while DSM, a Dutch\nchemicals group, warned that a 1% move in the EURUSD rate would reduce proﬁts\nby EUR$7 million to EUR$11 million. Unfortunately, inadequate hedging is still a\nreality in Europe, which makes monitoring the EURUSD exchange rate even more\nimportant in forecasting the earnings and proﬁtability of European exporters.\n■Nikkei and U.S. Dollar\nTraders exposed to Japanese equities also need to be aware of the developments\nthat are occurring in the U.S. dollar and ho w that affects the Nikkei rally. Japan\nrecently came out of 10 years of stagnation. During this time, mutual funds and\nhedge funds were grossly underweight Japanese equities. When the economy began\nto turn around, global macro funds rushed to make changes to their portfolios in fear\nof missing out on a great opportunity to take advantage of Japan’s recovery. Hedge\nfunds borrowed signiﬁcant amount of dollars to pay for increased exposure, but the\nproblem was that their borrowings were very sensitive to U.S. interest rates and the\nFed’s monetary policy tightening cycle. Increased borrowing costs forthe dollar could\nderail the Nikkei’s rally because higher rates will raise the dollar’s ﬁnancing costs. Yet\nwith the huge current account deﬁcit, the Fed might need to continue raising rates\nto increase the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Therefore, continual\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET3rate hikes, coupled with slowing growth in Japan, may make it less proﬁtable for\nfunds to be overleveraged and overly exposed to Japanese stocks. As a result, how\nthe U.S. dollar moves also plays a role on the future direction of the Nikkei.\n■George Soros\nKnown as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England,’’ George Soros is one of\nthe most well-known traders in the FX market. We discuss his adventures in\nmore detail in Chapter 2, but in a nutshell, in 1990, England decided to join\nthe Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) system because it wanted to take part in\nthe stable and low-inﬂation environment created by the Bundesbank, the central\nbank of Germany. This alliance tied the pound to the deutschmark, which meant\nthat the United Kingdom was subject to the monetary policies enforced by the\nBundesbank. In the early 1990s, Germany aggressively increased interest rates to\navoid the inﬂationary effects related to German reuniﬁcation. However, national\npride and the commitment of ﬁxing exchange rates within the ERM prevented\nEngland from devaluing the pound. On Wednesday, September 16, also known as\nBlack Wednesday, George Soros leveraged the entire value of his fund ($1 billion) and\nsold $10 billion worth of pounds to bet against the ERM. This essentially ‘‘broke’’\nthe Bank of England and forced it to devalue the pound. In a matter of 24 hours, the\nBritish pound fell approximately 5%, or 5000 pips. The Bank of England promised\nto raise rates in order to tempt speculators to buy pounds. As a result, this caused\ntremendous volatility in the bond markets, with 1-month UK LIBOR rates rising\n1% and then retracing those gains over the next 24 hours. If bond traders were\ncompleted oblivious to what was going on in the currency markets, they would have\nprobably found themselves dumbstruck in face of such rapid gyration in yields.\n■Chinese Yuan Revaluation and Bonds\nFor Treasury traders, there’s another currency-related issue that is important to\nfollow and that is the gradual revaluation of the Chinese yuan. For most of its history,\nthe yuan or renminbi (RMB) was pegged to the U.S. dollar. In the 1980s, the RMB\nwas devalued to promote growth in C hina’s economy, and between 1997 and 2005\nthe People’s Bank of China artiﬁcially maintained a USDRMB rate of 8.27. At the\ntime, it received signiﬁcant criticism because keeping the peg meant that the Chinese\ngovernment would artiﬁcially weaken its currency to make Chinese goods more\ncompetitive. To maintain the band, the Chinese government had to sell the yuan and\nbuy U.S. dollars each time their currency appreciated above the band’s upper limit.\nThese dollars were then used to purchase U.S. Treasuries, and this practice turned\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET4China into the world’s largest holder of U.S. Treasuries. In 2005, however, China\nended its dollar peg and linked the value of the yuan to a basket of currencies and\nallowed it to ﬂuctuate within a narrow band that was reset every day. While the exact\npercentage of the basket is unknown, it is largely dominated by the U.S. dollar and\nincludes other currencies such as the euro, Japanese yen, South Korean won, British\npound, Thai baht, Russian ruble, and Australian, Canadian, and Singapore dollar.\nThrough the years China has gradually widened the band that the yuan can trade\nin, but if China were to end the ﬂoat and allow the RMB to trade freely on the\nglobal foreign exchange market, the impact on the ﬁxed-income markets would be\nsigniﬁcant because it would reduce the government’s need to purchase Treasuries\nand other ﬁxed-income securities. An announcement of this sort would send yields\nsoaring and prices tumbling. While it could be years before this happens, it will be\nimportant for bond investors to follow these developments if they want to effectively\nmanage the risk.\n■Comparing the FX Market with Futures\nand Equities\nThe foreign exchange market has not always been a popular market to trade because\nfor many decades, it was restricted to hedge funds, commodity trading advisers who\nmanage large amounts of capital, major corporations, and institutional investors\ndue to regulation, capital requirements, and technology. Yet it was the market\nof choice for many of these large players because the risk was fully customizable.\nTrader A could use a 50 times leverage, and Trader B could trade cash on cash.\nWhen the market opened up to retail traders, many brokerage ﬁrms swept in to\nprovide leveraged trading along with free instantaneous execution platforms, charts,\nand real-time news. This access to low-cost information helped foreign exchange\ntrading surge in popularity, increasing its attractiveness as an alternative asset class\nto trade.\nMany equity and futures traders also turned to currencies, adding the asset class\nto their trading portfolios. Before you choose to do so, however, it is important to\nunderstand some of the key difference s between the forex and equity markets.\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs, and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET5Characteristics of Equities Market\n1. There is decent market liquidity, but that can depend on a stock’s daily volume.\n2. The market is only available for trading 9:30am to 5pm NY Time, with limited\nafter-hours trading.\n3. The existence of exchange fees results in higher costs and commissions.\n4. There is an uptick rule to short stocks, which many day traders ﬁnd frustrating.\n5. The number of steps involved in completing a trade can increase slippage and\nerror.\nAs one of the most liquid markets in the world, the volume and liquidity present in\nthe FX markets has allowed traders to access a 24-hour market with low transaction\ncosts, high leverage, the ability to proﬁt in both bull and bear markets, minimized\nerror rates, limited slippage, and no trading curbs or uptick rules. Oftentimes, traders\ncan use the same strategies for analyzing the equity markets in the FX market. Funda-\nmental traders will ﬁnd that countries can be analyzed like stocks. Technical traders\nwill ﬁnd that the FX market is perfect for their style of analysis because of the abun-\ndance of tick data and because it is already one of the most commonly used analysis\ntools by professional traders. Now let’s take a closer look at the individual attributes\nof the FX market to really understand why this is such an attractive market to trade!\n24-Hour Market\nOne of the primary reasons why the FX market is popular is because for active\ntraders, it is the ideal market to trade. It’s 24-hour nature offers traders instant access\nto the markets at all hours of the day for immediate response to global developments.\nThis characteristic also gives traders the added ﬂexibility of determining their own\ntrading day. Active day traders no longer have to wait for the equities market to\nopen at 9:30am NY Time to begin trading. If there is a signiﬁcant announcement or\ndevelopment either domest ically or overseas bet ween 4pm NY Time and 9:30am\nNY Time, most day traders will have to wait for the exchanges to open at 9:30am\nto place trades. In all likelihood, by that time, unless you have access to electronic\ncommunication networks (ECNs) such as Instinet for premarket trading, the market\nwould have gapped up or gapped down against your favor. This is particularly\nfrustrating when important data are released at 8:30am NY Time, such as nonfarm\npayrolls. Professionals would have already priced in the outcome before the average\ntrader can even access to market.\nIn addition, many people who want to trade also have a full-time job during\nthe day. The ability to trade after hours makes the FX market a much more\nconvenient market for all traders. Different times of the day will offer different\ntrading opportunities, as the global ﬁnancial centers around the world are all actively\ninvolved in foreign exchange. With the FX m arket, trading after hours with a large\nonline FX broker provides the same liquidity and spread as any other time of day.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET6As a guideline, at 5pm Sunday NY Time, trading begins as the markets open in\nSydney, Australia. Then, the Tokyo markets open at 7 pm NY Time. Next, Singapore\nand Hong Kong open at 9pm NY Time followed by the European markets in Frankfurt\n(2am) and then London (3am). By 4am the European markets are in full swing, and\nAsia has concluded their trading day. The U.S. markets open ﬁrst in New York around\n8am Monday as Europe winds down. By 5pm, Sydney is set to reopen once again.\nThe majority of trading activity happens when the markets overlap; for example,\nAsia and Europe trading overlaps between 12am to approximately 2am, Europe and\nthe United States overlaps between 8a m to approximately 12pm NY Time, while\nthe United States and Asia overlap be tween 5pm and 9pm. During New York and\nLondon hours, all currency pairs trade actively. During the Asian hours, however,\nthe trading activity for pairs such as the GBPJPY and AUDJPY tend to peak.\nLower Transaction Costs\nLower transaction costs also makes forex an attractive asset class to trade. In the\nequity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission and with online\nequity brokers, commissions can run upwards of $20 per trade. This means that for\npositions of $100,000, average roundtrip commissions could be as high as $120.\nThe over the counter (OTC) structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which, in turn, lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Equity traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade for\nshort-term traders. For an active equity trader who typically places 30 trades a day,\nat $20 commission per trade, you would have to up to pay $600 in daily transaction\ncosts. This is a signiﬁcant amount of money that could take a large cut out of proﬁts\nor deepen losses. The reason why costs are so high is because there are a lot of\npeople involved in an equity transaction. More speciﬁcally, for each trade, there is\na broker, the exchange, and the specialist. All of these parties need to be paid, and\ntheir payment comes in the form of commission and clearing fees. In the FX market,\nbecause it is decentralized with no exchange or clearinghouse (everything is taken\ncare of by the market maker), these fees are not applicable.\nCustomizable Leverage\nEven though many people realize that higher leverage comes with risks, traders are\nhumans, and few of them ﬁnd it easy to turn away the opportunity to trade on\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET7someone else’s money. The FX market caters perfectly to these traders by offering\nthe highest leverage available for any market. Most online currency ﬁrms offer 50\ntimes leverage on regular-sized accounts and up to 200 times leverage on miniature\naccounts (abroad leverage can be as high as 400 times). Compare that to the 2 times\nleverage offered to the average equity investor and the 10 times capital that is\ntypically offered to the professional trader, and you can see why many traders have\nturned to the foreign exchange market. The margin deposit for leverage in the FX\nmarket is not seen as a down payment on a purchase of equity, as many perceive\nmargins to be in the stock markets. Rather, the margin is a performance bond, or\ngood-faith deposit, to ensure against trading losses. This is very useful to short-term\nday traders who need the enhancement in capital to generate quick returns. For the\nmore risk-averse investor, leverage is completely customizable, which means that\nif they only feel comfortable with 10 or 20 times leverage or no leverage at all,\nthey can elect to do so. It is extremely important to understand that leverage is a\ndouble-edged sword—it can magnify proﬁts but also losses.\nProﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nIn the FX market, proﬁt potentials exist in both bull and bear markets. Since\ncurrency trading always involves buying one currency and selling another, there\nis no structural bias to the market. Therefore, if you are long one currency, you\nare at the same time short another. As a result, equal proﬁt potential exists in\nboth upward-trending and downward-trending markets. This is different from the\nequities market, where most traders go long instead of short stocks, so the general\nequity investment community tends to suffer in a bear market.\nNo Trading Curbs or Uptick Rule\nThe FX market is the largest market in the world, forcing market makers to offer\nvery competitive prices. Unlike the equities market, there is never a time in the\nFX markets when trading curbs would take into effect and trading would be halted,\nonly to gap when reopened. This eliminates missed proﬁts due to archaic exchange\nregulations. In the FX market, traders would be able to place trades 24 hours a day\nwith virtually no disruptions.\nOne of the biggest annoyances for day trades in the equity market is the fact\nthat traders are prohibited from shorting a stock in a downtrend unless there is an\nuptick. This can be very frustrating as traders wait to join short sellers, but are only\nleft with continually watching the stock trend down before an uptick occurs. In the\nFX market, there is no such rule. If you want to short a currency pair, you can do\nso immediately; this allows for instant and efﬁcient execution.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET8Online Trading Reducing Error Rates\nA shorter trade process minimizes errors. Online currency trading is typically a\nthree-step process. A trader would place an order on the platform, the FX dealing\ndesk would automatically execute it electronically, and the order conﬁrmation\nwould be posted or logged onto the trader’s trading station. Typically, these three\nsteps would be completed in a matter of seconds. For an equities trade on the other\nhand, there is generally a ﬁve-step process. The client would call his broker to place\nan order, the broker sends the order to the exchange ﬂoor, the specialist on the\nﬂoor tries to match up orders (the broker competes with other brokers to get the\nbest ﬁll for the client), the specialist executes the trade, and the client receives a\nconﬁrmation from the broker. The elimination of a middleman minimizes the error\nrates in currency trades and increases the efﬁciency of each transaction.\nLimited Slippage\nUnlike the equity markets, many online FX market makers provide instantaneous\nexecution from real-time, two-way quotes. These quotes are the prices where the\nﬁrms are willing to buy or sell the quoted currency, rather than vague indications\nof where the market is trading, which may or may not be honored. Orders are\nexecuted and conﬁrmed within seconds. Robust systems would never request the\nsize of a trader’s potential order, or which side of the market he’s trading, before\ngiving him a bid/offer quote. Inefﬁcient dealers determine whether the investor is a\nbuyer or a seller, and shade the price to increase their own proﬁt on the transaction.\nThe equity market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’ system, under\nwhich you may not get executed at the price you wish, but rather at the next best\nprice available. For example, let’s say Microsoft is trading at $52.50. If you enter a\nbuy order at this rate, by the time it reaches the specialist on the exchange ﬂoor, the\nprice may have risen to $53.25. In this case, you will not get executed at $52.50;\nyou will get executed at $53.25, which is essentially a loss of 3∕4of a point. The\nprice transparency provided by the some of the better market makers assures that\ntraders always receive a fair price.\nPerfect Market for Technical Analysis\nFor technical analysts, currencies rarely spend much time in tight trading ranges and\nhave the tendency to develop strong trends. Over 80% of volume is speculative in\nnature and as a result, the market frequently overshoots and then corrects itself.\nHence, technical analysis works well for the FX market, and a technically trained\ntrader can easily identify new trends and breakouts, which provide multiple oppor-\ntunities to enter and exit positions. Charts and indicators are used by all professional\nFX market traders, and candle charts are available on most charting packages. In addi-\ntion, the most commonly used indicators such as Fibonacci retracements, stochastics,\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET9MACD, moving averages, RSI, and support/resistance levels have proven valid in\nmany instances.\nIn the USDJPY chart shown in Figure 1.1, it is clear that Fibonacci retracements,\nmoving averages, and stochastics have at one point or another given successful\ntrading signals. For example, the 61.8% retracement level served as resistance for\nUSDJPY in December 2014, January 2015, and February 2015. The moving-average\ncrossovers of the 10- and 20-day simple moving averages also successfully forecasted\nthe rally in USDJPY in late October, along with the decline in early January. Equity\ntraders who focus on technical analysis have the easiest transition, since they can\nimplement the same technical strategies that they use in the equities market into the\nFX market.\nAnalyze Stocks Like Countries\nTrading currencies is not a big challenge for fundamental traders either, because\ncountries can be analyzed like stocks. For example, if you analyze growth rates of\nstocks, you can use gross domestic product (GDP) to analyze the growth rate of\ncountries. If you analyze inventory and production ratios, you can follow industrial\nproduction (IP) or durable goods data. If you follow sales ﬁgures, you can analyze\nretail sales data. As with a stock investme n t ,i ti sb e t t e rt oi n v e s ti nt h ec u r r e n c yo fa\ncountry that is growing faster and fund it with a currency of a country that is growing\nslower. Currency prices reﬂect the balance of supply and demand for currencies.\nTwo of the primary factors affecting supply and demand of currencies are interest\nrates and the overall strength of the economy. Economic indicators such as GDP,\nforeign investment, and the trade balance reﬂect the general health of an economy\nand are therefore responsible for the underlying shifts in supply and demand for\nthat currency. There is a tremendous amount of data released at regular intervals,\nsome of which are more important than others. Data related to interest rates and\ninternational trade is the most closely followed.\nIf there is uncertainty regarding the direction of interest rates, any bit of news\non monetary policy can directly affect how the currency trades. Traditionally,\nif a country raises its interest rate, the currency of that country will strengthen\nin relation to other countries as investors shift assets to that country to gain a\nhigher return. In contrast, an interest rates hike is generally bad news for stocks\nbecause it means that borrowing costs have risen. In response, some investors will\ntransfer money out of a country’s stock market when interest rates are increased,\ncausing the country’s currency to weaken. Determining which effect dominates can\nbe tricky, but generally there is an advance consensus on how interest rates will\nmove. Indicators that have the biggest impact on interest rates are producer prices,\nconsumer prices, employment, spending, and GDP. Most of the time monetary\npolicy announcements are known in advance with meeting dates by the Bank of\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET10\nFIGURE 1.1 USDJPY Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET11England (BoE), the Federal Reserve (FED), European Central Bank (ECB), Bank\nof Japan (BoJ), and other central banks posted on their respective websites.\nAnother piece of data that can impact how currencies move is the trade balance,\nwhich shows the net differ ence over a period of time b etween a nation’s exports and\nimports. When a country imports more than it exports, the trade balance will show\na deﬁcit, which is generally considered unfavorable. For example, if U.S. dollars are\nsold for other domestic national currencies (to pay for imports), the ﬂow of dollars\noutside the country will depreciate the value of the dollar. Similarly, if trade ﬁgures\nshow an increase in exports, dollars will ﬂow into the United States and appreciate\nthe value of the dollar. From the standpoint of a national economy, a deﬁcit in and of\nitself is not necessarily a bad thing. If the deﬁcit is greater than market expectations\nhowever, it can trigger a negative price movement.\n■FX versus Futures\nTrading spot forex is also different from trading futures, and like equity traders,\nmany futures traders have also added currency spot trading into their portfolios. We\nknow that the spot forex market has the following attributes:\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nCharacteristics of Futures Markets\n1. There is limited market liquidity depending on the month of contract trades.\n2. The presence of exchange fees results in more costs and commissions.\n3. Market hours for futures trading are much shorter than spot and are dependent\non the product traded; each product may have different open and closing hours,\nand there is limited after-hours trading.\n4. Futures leverage is higher than equities, but still only a fraction of the leverage\noffered in FX.\n5. There tends to be prolonged bear markets.\n6. Pit trading structure increases error and slippage.\nLike in the equities market, traders can implement the same strategies they use\nin analyzing the futures markets in the FX m arket. Most future tr aders are technical\ntraders, and the FX market is perfect for technical analysis. In fact, it is the most\npopular analysis technique used by professional FX traders. Taking a closer look at\nhow the futures market stacks up, we see the following.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET12Comparing Market Hours and Liquidity\nThe volume traded in the FX market is estimated to be over ﬁve times that of the\nfutures market. The FX market is open for trading 24 hours a day, but the futures\nmarket has confusing market hours which vary based on the product traded. For\nexample, if you traded gold futures, it is only open for trading between 7:20am\nand 1:30pm on the COMEX. If you traded crude oil futures on the New York\nMercantile Exchange, t rading would only be ope n between 8:30am. and 2:10pm.\nThese varying hours not only create confusion but also makes it difﬁcult to act on\nbreakthrough announcements throughout the reminder of the day.\nIn addition, if you have a day job and can only trade after hours, futures would be\na very inconvenient market product to trade. You would basically be placing orders\nbased on past prices that are not current market prices. This lack of transparency\nmakes trading very cumbersome. In addition, each time zone has its own unique\nnews and developments that could move speciﬁc currency pairs, and with futures it\ncan difﬁcult to act on breaking overnight news.\nLow to Zero Transaction Costs\nIn the equity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission. With future\nbrokers, average commissions can run close to $160 per trade on positions of\n$100,000 or greater. The OTC structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which can in turn lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight,\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Futures traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow to zero transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade\nfor short-term traders. If you are an active futures trader who typically places 20\ntrades a day, at $100 commission per trade, you would have to pay $2,000 in daily\ntransaction costs. A typical futures trade involves a broker, a future commissions\nmerchant (FCM) order desk, a clerk on the exchange ﬂoor, a runner, and a pit\ntrader. All of these parties need to be paid, and their payment comes in the form of\ncommission and clearing fees, whereas the electronic nature of the market minimizes\nthese costs.\nNo Limit Up or Down Rules/Proﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nUnlike the tight restriction on the futures market, there is no limit down or limit\nup rule in the FX market. For example, on the S&P index futures, if the contract\nvalue falls more than 5% from the previous day’s close, limit down rules will come\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET13in effect, whereby on a 5% move, the index would only be allowed to trade at\nor above this level for the next 10 minutes. For a 20% decline, trading would be\ncompletely halted. Due to the decentralized nature of the FX market, there are no\nexchange-enforced restrictions on daily activity, which can help eliminate missed\nopportunities caused by archaic exchange regulations.\nExecution Quality and Speed/Low Error Rates\nThe futures market is also known for inconsistent execution, both in terms of pricing\nand execution time. Every futures trader has, at some point in time, experienced\na half hour or so wait for a market order to be ﬁlled, only to ﬁnd that the order\nhas been executed at a price far away from where the market was trading when\nthe initial order was placed. Even with electronic trading and limited guarantees of\nexecution speed, the price for ﬁlls on market orders is far from certain. The reason\nfor this inefﬁciency is the number of steps that are involved in placing a futures\ntrade. A futures trade is typically a seven-step process:\n1. The client calls his broker and places his trade (or places it online).\n2. The trading desk receives the order, processes it, and routes it to the FCM\norder desk on the exchange ﬂoor.\n3. The FCM order desk passes the order to the order clerk.\n4. The order clerk hands the order to a runner or signals it to the pit.\n5. The trading clerk goes to the pit to execute the trade.\n6. The trade conﬁrmation goes to the runner or is signaled to the order clerk and\nprocessed by the FCM order desk.\n7. The broker receives the trade conﬁrmation and passes it on to the client.\nAn FX trade in comparison is typically only a three-step process. A trader would\nplace an order on the platform, the FX dealing desk would automatically execute\nit electronically, and the order conﬁrmation would be posted or logged on the\ntrader’s trading station. The elimination of the involvement of these additional\nparties increases the speed of the trade execution and decreases errors.\nIn addition, the futures market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’\nsystem, under which your trades frequently do not get executed at the initial market\norder price, but rather, at the next best price available. For example, let’s say a\nclient is long 5 March Dow Jones futures contracts at 8800. If the client enters a\nstop order at 8700, when the rate reaches this level, the client will most likely be\nexecuted at 8690. This 10-point difference would be attributed to slippage, which\nis very common in the futures market.\nOn most FX trading stations, traders execute directly off of real-time streaming\nprices. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, there is generally no discrepancy\nbetween the displayed price and the execution price. This holds true even during\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET14volatile times and fast-moving markets. In the futures market, execution is uncertain\nbecause all orders must be done on the exchange. This creates a situation where\nliquidity is limited by the number of participants, which, in turn, limits quantities\nthat can be traded at a given price. Real-time streaming prices ensure that market\norders, stops, and limits are executed with minimal slippage and no partial ﬁlls.\n■W h oA r et h eP l a y e r si nt h eF XM a r k e t ?\nSince the foreign exchange market is an OTC market without a centralized exchange,\ncompetition between market makers prohibits monopolisti c pricing strategies. If\none market maker attempts to drastically skew the price, then traders simply have\nthe option to ﬁnd another market maker. Moreover, spreads are closely watched to\nensure market makers are not whimsically altering the cost of the trade. Many equity\nmarkets, on the other hand, operate in a completely different fashion; the New York\nStock Exchange, for instance, is the sole place where companies listed on the NYSE\ncan have their stocks traded. Centralized markets are operated by what are referred\nto as specialists. Market makers, on the other hand, is the term used in reference to\ndecentralized marketplaces. Since the NYSE is a centralized market, a stock traded\non the NYSE can only have one bid–ask quote at all times. Decentralized markets,\nsuch as foreign exchange, can have multiple market makers—all of whom have the\nright to quote different prices. Here is an illustration of how both centralized and\ndecentralized markets operate.\nCentralized Markets\nBy their very nature, centralized markets tend to be monopolistic: With a single\nspecialist controlling th e market, prices can easil y be skewed to a ccommodate the\ninterests of the specialist, not those of the traders (see Figure 1.2). If, for example,\nthe market is ﬁlled with sellers that the specialists must buy from but no prospective\nbuyers on the other side, the specialist may simply widen the spread, thereby\nBuyers\nCan buy only\nfrom one\nspecialistSpecialist\nUnites buyers and\nsellers; maintains\nsole control over\nthe spreadSellers\nCan sell only to\none specialist\nFIGURE 1.2 Centralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET15increasing the cost of the trade and preventing additional participants from entering\nthe market. Or, specialists can drastically alter the quotes they are offering, thus\nmanipulating the price to accommodate their own risk tolerance.\nHierarchy of Participants\nWhile the foreign exchange market is decentralized, and hence employs multiple\nmarket makers rather than a single specialist, participants in the FX market are\norganized into a hierarchy; those with superior credit access, volume transacted,\nand sophistication receive priority pricing in the market (see Figure 1.3). At the\ntop of the food chain is the interbank market, which trades the highest volume per\nday in relatively few currencies. In the interbank market, the largest banks can deal\nwith each other directly, via interbank brokers, or through electronic brokering\nsystems like EBS or Reuters. The interbank market is a credit-approved system,\nwhere banks trade based solely on the credit relationships they have established\nwith one another. The banks can see the rates everyone is dealing at, but each bank\nmust have a speciﬁc credit relationship with that bank in order to trade at the rates\nbeing offered. Other institutions such as online FX market makers, hedge funds,\nand corporations must trade FX through these banks, although some have created\ntheir own liquidity pools through the years. Many banks (e.g., small community\nbanks or banks in emerging markets), corporations, and institutional investors do\nnot have access to these rates because they have no established credit lines with\nbig banks. This forces smaller participants to deal through just one bank for their\nRetail Clients\nTrader\nTrader\nTrader\nTraderOnline TradingInterbank Market\nBank Bank\nBank BankEBS and\nReutersOnline FX\nMarket\nMakers\nFIGURE 1.3 Decentralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET16foreign exchange needs, and oftentimes this means much less competitive rates for\nthe participants further down the participant hierarchy. Those receiving the least\ncompetitive rates are customers of banks and physical currency exchange companies.\nRecently, technology has broken down the barriers that used to stand between the\nend-users of foreign exchange services and the interbank market. The online trading\nrevolution opened its doors to retail clientele by connecting market makers and\nmarket participants in an efﬁcient, low-cost manner. In essence, online trading\nplatforms serve as a gateway to the liquid FX market. Average traders can now\ntrade alongside the biggest banks in the world, with virtually similar pricing and\nexecution. What used to be a game dominated and controlled by the ‘‘big boys’’ is\nslowly becoming a level playing ﬁeld where individuals can proﬁt and take advantage\nof the same opportunities as big banks. FX is no longer an old boys club, which\nmeans opportunities abound for aspiring online currency traders.\nDealing Stations— Interbank Market\nFor serious traders who want to know more about the interbank market, the\nmajority of FX volume is actually transacted primarily through the interbank\nmarket. The leading banks of the world trade with each other electronically\nover two platforms—the EBS and Reuters, dealing 3000-spot matching. Both\nplatforms offer trading in the major currency pairs; however, certain currency\npairs are more liquid and generally more frequently traded over one versus the\nother. Some cross-currency pairs are traded over these platforms as well, but\nothers are calculated from the rates of the major currency pairs and are then offset\nusing the ‘‘legs.’’ For example, if an interbank trader had a client who wanted to\ngo long NZDCAD, the trader would most likely buy NZDUSD and USDCAD\nseparately. The trader would then multiply these rates and provide the client with\nthe respective NZDCAD rate, creating a synthetic quote and trade.\n17CHAPTER 2\nHistorical Events in\nthe FX Markets\nBefore learning how to trade currencies, it is important for every new and\nseasoned market participant to have some understanding about the most\nimportant historical events that have shaped the currency market. To this day, these\nevents are often referenced by professional traders.\n■Bretton Woods: Anointing the Dollar as the World\nCurrency (1944)\nIn July 1944, representatives of 44 nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire,\nto create a new institutional arrangement for governing the international economy\nin the years following World War II. Most agreed that international economic\ninstability was one of the principle causes of the war, and that such instability needed\nto be prevented in the future. The agreement, which was developed by renowned\neconomists John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White, was initially proposed\nto Great Britain as a part of the Lend Lease Act—an American act designed to assist\nGreat Britain in postwar redevelopment efforts. After various negotiations, the ﬁnal\nform of the Bretton Woods Agreement consisted of three key items:\n1. The formation of key international authorities designed to promote fair trade\nand international economic harmony\n2. The ﬁxation of exchange rates between currencies\n3. The convertibility between gold and t he U.S. dollar, thus empowering the U.S.\ndollar as the reserve currency of choice for the world\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS18Of these three parameters, only the ﬁrst is still in existence today, but the\norganizations formed as a direct result of Bretton Woods include the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT); and they all play a crucial role in modern day development and regulation\nof international economies. Since the demise of Bretton Woods, the IMF has\nworked closely with the World Bank. Toge ther, the two institutions now regularly\nlend funds to developing nations, assisting them in the development of a public\ninfrastructure capable of supporting a sound mercantile economy that can contribute\nin the international arena. In order to ensure that these nations can actually enjoy\nequal and legitimate access to trade with their industrialized counterparts, the World\nBank and IMF must work closely with GATT. While GATT was initially meant to\nbe a temporary organization, it now operates to encourage the dismantling of trade\nbarriers—namely, tariffs and quotas.\nThe Bretton Woods Agreement existed from 1944 to 1971, after which it\nwas replaced by the Smithsonian Agreement, an international contract pioneered\nby U.S. President Richard Nixon out the necessity to accommodate for Bretton\nWoods’ shortcomings. Unfortunately, the Smithsonian Agreement possessed the\nsame critical weakness: While it did not include gold/U.S. dollar convertibility,\nit maintained ﬁxed exchange rates—a facet that did not accommodate the United\nStates’ ongoing trade deﬁcit and the international need for a weaker U.S. dollar. As\na result, the Smithsonian Agreement was short-lived.\nUltimately, the exchange rates of t he world evolved into a free market,\nwhere supply and demand were the sole criteria that determined the value of a\ncurrency. While this did and still does result in a number of currency crises and\ngreater volatility between currencies, it also allowed the market to become self-\nregulating, and thus could dictate the appropriate value of a currency without any\nhindrances.\nAs for Bretton Woods, perhaps its most memorable contribution to the interna-\ntional economic arena was its role in changing the international perception about the\nU.S. dollar. While the euro is a revolutionary currency blazing new frontiers in both\nsocial behavior and international trade, the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve\ncurrency of choice. This is due, in large part, to the Bretton Woods Agreement:\nBy establishing dollar/gold convertibility, the dollar’s role as the world’s most\naccessible and reliable currency was ﬁrmly cemented. So while Bretton Woods\nmight be a doctrine of yesteryear, its impact on the U.S. dollar and international\neconomics still resonates today.\n■The End of Bretton Woods: Free Market\nCapitalism Is Born (1971)\nOn August 15, 1971, it became ofﬁcial: The Bretton-Woods system was abandoned\nonce and for all. While it had been exorcised before—only to subsequently emerge\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS19in a new form—this ﬁnal eradication of the Bretton Woods system was truly its\nlast stand: No longer would currencies be ﬁxed in value to gold, allowed only to\nﬂuctuate in a 1% range, but instead, their fair valuation could be determined by\nfree-market behavior such as trade ﬂows and foreign direct investment.\nAlthough U.S. President Nixon was conﬁdent that the end of the Bretton Woods\nsystem would bring about better times for the international economy, he was\nnot a believer that the free market could dictate a currency’s true valuation in a\nfair and catastrophe-free manner. Nixon and many well-respected economists at\nthe time reasoned that an entirely unstructured foreign exchange market would\nresult in competing devaluations, which, in turn, would lead to the breakdown of\ninternational trade and investment. The end result, Nixon and his board of economic\nadvisors argued, would be global depression.\nIn response, the Smithsonian Agreement was introduced a few months later.\nHailed by President Nixon as the ‘‘greatest monetary agreement in the history of\nthe world,’’ the Smithsonian Agreement strived to maintain ﬁxed exchange rates\nwithout the backing of gold. Its key difference from the Bretton Woods system was\nthat the value of the dollar could ﬂoat in a range of 2.25%, compared to just 1%\nunder Bretton Woods.\nUltimately, the Smithsonian Agreement proved to be unfeasible as well. Without\nexchange rates ﬁxed to gold, the free market gold price shot up to $215 per\nounce. Moreover, the U.S. trade deﬁcit continued to grow, and from a fundamental\nstandpoint, the U.S. dollar needed to be devalued beyond the 2.25% parameters\nestablished by the Smithsonian Agreement. In light of these problems, the foreign\nexchange markets were forced to close in February 1972.\nThe markets reopened in March 1973, and this time, they were not bound by a\nSmithsonian Agreement: The value of the US dollar was to be determined entirely\nby the market, as its value was not ﬁxed to any commodity, nor was its exchange rate\nﬂuctuation conﬁned to certain parameters. While this did provide the U.S. dollar,\nand other currencies by default, the agility required to adapt to a new and rapidly\nevolving international trading environment, it also set the stage for unprecedented\ninﬂation. The end of Bretton Woods and the Smithsonian Agreement, as well as\nconﬂicts in the Middle East, resulted in substantially higher oil prices and helped\nto create stagﬂation—the synthesis of unemployment and inﬂation—in the U.S.\neconomy. It would not be until later in the decade, when Federal Reserve Chairman\nPaul Volcker initiated new economic policies and President Reagan introduced a new\nﬁscal agenda, that the U.S. dollar would return to ‘‘normal’’ valuations. By then,\nthe foreign exchange markets had thoroughly developed and were capable of serving\na multitude of purposes. In addition to employing a laissez-faire style of regulation\non international trade, they also were beginning to attract speculators seeking to\nparticipate in a market with unrivaled liquidity and continued growth. Ultimately,\nthe death of Bretton Woods in 1971 marked the beginning of a new economic era, one\nthat liberated international trading while also proliferating speculative opportunities.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS20■Plaza Accord—Devaluation\nof the U.S. Dollar (1985)\nAfter the demise of all the various exchange rate regulatory mechanisms that\ncharacterized the twentieth century—t hat is, the Gold Standard, the Bretton\nWoods Standard, and the Smithsonian Agreement—the currency market was left\nwith virtually no regulation other than the mythical ‘‘invisible hand’’ of free\nmarket capitalism, one that supposedly strived to create economic balance through\nsupply and demand. Unfortunately, due to a number of unforeseen economic\nevents—such as the OPEC oil crises, stagﬂation throughout the 1970s, and drastic\nchanges in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ﬁscal policy—supply and demand, in and\nof themselves, became insufﬁcient means by which the currency markets could be\nregulated. A system of sorts was needed, but not one that was inﬂexible: Fixation of\ncurrency values to a commodity, such as gold, proved to be too rigid for economic\ndevelopment, as was also the notion of ﬁxing maximum exchange rate ﬂuctuations.\nThe balance between structure and rigidity was one that had plagued the currency\nmarkets throughout the twentieth century, and while advancements had been made,\na deﬁnitive solution was still greatly needed.\nHence, in 1985, the respective ministers of ﬁnance and central bank governors\nof the world’s leading economies—France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom,\nand the United States—convened in New York City, with the hopes of arranging a\ndiplomatic agreement that would work to optimize the economic effectiveness of\nthe foreign exchange markets. Meeting at the Plaza Hotel, the international leaders\ncame to the following agreements regarding speciﬁc economies and the international\neconomy as a whole:\n■Across the world, inﬂation was at very low levels. Contrary to the stagﬂation of\nthe 1970s—where inﬂation was high and real economic growth was low—the\nglobal economy in 1985 had done a complete 180, as inﬂation was now low and\ngrowth was strong.\n■While low inﬂation, even when coupled with robust economic growth, still\nallowed for low interest rates—a caveat that developing countries particularly\nenjoyed—there was an imminent danger of protectionist policies such as tariffs\nentering the economy. The United States was experiencing a large and growing\ncurrent account deﬁcit, while Japan and Germany were facing large and growing\nsurpluses. An imbalance so fundamental in nature could create serious economic\ndisequilibrium, which, in turn, would result in a distortion of the foreign exchange\nmarkets, and thus, the international economy as a whole.\n■The results of current account imbalances, and the protectionist policies that\nensued, required action. Ultimately, it was believed that the rapid acceleration\nin the value of the U.S. dollar, which appreciated more than 80% against the\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS21currencies of its major trading partners, was the primary culprit. The rising\nvalue of the U.S. dollar created enormous trade deﬁcits, hurting many different\neconomies.\nAt the meeting in the Plaza Hotel, the Uni ted States persuad ed other attending\ncountries to coordinate a multilateral intervention, and on September 22, 1985,\nthe Plaza Accord was implemented. This agreement was designed to allow for\na controlled decline of the dollar and the appreciation of the main anti-dollar\ncurrencies. Each country agreed to changes to their economic policies and to\nintervene in currency markets as necessary to weaken the value of the dollar. The\nUnited States agreed to cut its budget deﬁcit and lower interest rates. France, the\nUnited Kingdom, Germany, and Japan agreed to raise interest rates. Germany also\nagreed to tax cuts, while Japan agreed to let the value of the yen ‘‘fully reﬂect\nthe underlying strength of the Japanese economy.’’ However, one major problem\nwas that not every country adhered to their pledges made under the Plaza Accord.\nThe United States, in particular, did not follow through with its initial promise to\ncut the budget deﬁcit. Japan was severely hurt by the sharp rise in the yen, as its\nexporters were unable to remain competitive overseas, and it is argued that this\neventually triggered a 10-year recession in Japan. The United S tates, on the other\nhand, enjoyed considerable growth and price stability as a result of the agreement.\nThe effects of the multilateral intervention were seen immediately, and within\nless than two years, the dollar fell 46% and 50% against the German deutschemark\nand the Japanese yen, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.1.

This gradually resolved\nthe current account deﬁcits for the time being, and also ensured that protectionist\npolicies were minimal and nonthreatening. But perhaps most importantly, the\nPlaza Accord cemented the role of the central banks in regulating exchange rate\nmovement—yes, the rates would not be ﬁxed, and hence would be determined\nprimarily by supply and demand; but ultimately, such an invisible hand is insufﬁcient,\nand it was the right and responsibility of the world’s central banks to intervene on\nbehalf of the international economy when necessary.\n■George Soros—The Man Who Broke the Bank\nof England\nWhen George Soros placed a $10 billion speculative bet on the UK pound and\nwon, he became universally known as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England.’’\nWhether you love him or hate him, Soros led the charge in one of the most\nfascinating events in currency trading history. Here are the details.\nThe UK Joins the Exchange Rate Mechanism\nIn 1979, a Franco-German initiative set up the European Monetary System (EMS) to\nstabilize exchange rates, reduce inﬂation, and prepare for monetary integration. The\nExchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), one of the EMS’s main components, gave each\nparticipatory currency a central exchange rate against a basket of currencies, the\nEuropean Currency Unit (ECU). Participants (initially France, Germany, Italy, the\nNetherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and Luxemburg) were then required to\nmaintain their exchange rates within a 2.25% ﬂuctuation band above or below each\nbilateral central rate. The ERM was an adjustable-peg system, and nine realignments\nwould occur between 1979 and 1987. Whil e the United Kingdom was not one of\nthe original members, it would eventually join in 1990 at a rate of DM2.95 to the\npound and with a ﬂuctuation band of +/–6%.\nUntil mid-1992, the ERM appeared to be a success, as a disciplinary effect\nhad reduced inﬂation throughout Europe under the leadership of the German\nBundesbank. The stability wouldn’t last, however, as international investors started\nworrying that the exchange rate values of several currencies within the ERM\nwere inappropriate. Following German reuniﬁcation in 1989 government spending\nsurged, forcing the Bundesbank to print more money. This led to high inﬂation\nand left the German central bank with little choice but to increase interest rates.\nHowever, the rate hike came with consequences as it placed upward pressure on\nthe German mark. This forced other central banks to raise their interest rates as\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS23well as to maintain their pegged currency exchange rates (a direct application of\nIrving Fischer’s interest parity theory). Realizing that the UK’s weak economy and\nhigh unemployment rate would not permit the British government to maintain this\npolicy for long, George Soros stepped into action.\nSoros Bets Against the Success of UK Involvement in the ERM\nThe quantum hedge fund manager essentially wanted to bet that the pound would\ndepreciate because the United Kingdom would either devalue the pound or leave the\nERM. Thanks to the progressive removal of capital controls during the EMS years,\ninternational investors at the time had more freedom than ever to take advantage\nof perceived disequilibria, so Soros established short positions in pounds and long\npositions in marks by borrowing pounds and investing in mark-denominated assets.\nHe also made great use of options and futures. In all, his positions accounted for\na gargantuan $10 billion. Soros was not the only one; many other investors soon\nfollowed suit. Everyone was selling pounds, placing tremendous downward pressure\non the currency.\nAt ﬁrst, the Bank of England (BoE) tried to defend the pegged rates by buying\n15 billion pounds with its large reserve assets, but its sterilized interventions\n(whereby the monetary base is held constant thanks to open market interventions)\nwere limited in their effectiveness. The pound was trading dangerously close to the\nlower levels of its ﬁxed band. On September 16, 1992, a day that would later be\nknown as Black Wednesday, the bank announced a 2% rise in interest rates (from\n10% to 12%) in an attempt to boost the pound’s appeal. A few hours later, it\npromised to raise rates again to 15%, but international investors such as Soros could\nnot be swayed, knowing that huge proﬁts were right around the corner. Traders\nkept selling pounds in huge volumes, and the BoE kept buying them until, ﬁnally, at\n7:00 pm that same day, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced that Britain would\nleave the ERM and that rates would return to their initial level of 10%. The chaotic\nBlack Wednesday marked the beginning of a steep depreciation in the pound’s\neffective value.\nWhether the return to a ﬂoating currency was due to the Soros-led attack on\nthe pound or because of simple fundamental analysis is still debated today. What\nis certain, however, is that the pound’s depreciation of almost 15% against the\ndeutschemark and 25% against the dollar over the next ﬁve weeks as seen in Figure 2.2\nand Figure 2.3 resulted in tremendous proﬁts for Soros and others traders (the pound\nalso weakened by a similar proportion to the dollar). Within a month, the quantum\nfund cashed in on approximately $2 billion by selling the now more expensive\nDMs and buying back the now cheaper pounds. ‘‘The man who broke the Bank of\nEngland’’ showed how central banks can still be vulnerable to speculative attacks.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS243.00British Pound vs. Deutschemark (GBPDEM)\n2.90\n2.80\n2.70\n2.60\n2.50\n2.40\n2.30\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.2 GBPDEM after Soros\n2.10\n2.00\n1 .90\n1 .80\n1 .70\n1 .60\n1 .50\n1 .40British Pound Against US Dollar GBPUSD\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.3 GBPUSD after Soros\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS25■Asian Financial Crisis (1997–1998)\nFalling like a set of dominos on July 2, 1997, the relatively nascent Asian tiger\neconomies provide the perfect example of the interdependence in global capital\nmarkets and their subsequent effects throughout international currency forums.\nBased on several fundamental breakdowns, the cause of the ‘‘contagion’’ stemmed\nlargely from shrouded lending practices, inﬂated trade deﬁcits, and immature capital\nmarkets. Compiled, these factors contributed to a perfect storm that left major\nregional markets incapacitated and once-prized currencies devalued to signiﬁcantly\nlower levels. With adverse effects easily seen in the equities markets, currency\nmarket ﬂuctuations were negatively impacted in much the same manner during this\ntime period.\nThe Bubble\nLeading up to 1997, investors had become increasingly attracted to Asian investment\nprospects, focusing on real estate development and domestic equities. As a result,\nforeign investment capital ﬂowed into the region as economic growth rates climbed\non improved production in countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and\nKorea. Thailand, home of the baht, experienced a 6.5% growth rate in 1996, falling\nfrom 13% in 1988. Lending additional support for a stronger economy was the\nenactment of a ﬁxed currency peg to the U.S. dollar. With a ﬁxed valuation to\nthe greenback, countries like Thailand could ensure ﬁnancial stability in their own\nmarkets and a constant rate for export trading purposes with the world’s largest\neconomy. Ultimately, the region’s national currencies appreciated, as underlying\nfundamentals were justiﬁed and increased speculative positions of further climbs in\nprice mounted.\nBallooning Current Account Deﬁcits and Nonperforming Loans\nHowever, in early 1997, a shift in sentiment began to occur as international account\ndeﬁcits became increasingly difﬁcult for respective governments to handle and\nlending practices were revealed to be detrimental to the economic infrastructure. In\nparticular, economists were alerted to the fact that Thailand’s current account deﬁcit\nballooned in 1996 to $14.7 billion and had been climbing since 1992. Although\ncomparatively smaller than the U.S. deﬁcit, the gap represented 8% of the country’s\ngross domestic product. Shrouded lending practices also contributed heavily to\nthese breakdowns, as close personal relationships with high-ranking banking ofﬁcials\nwere well rewarded and surprisingly common throughout the region. In particular\nthis affected many of South Korea’s highly leveraged conglomerates as total\nnonperforming loan values skyrocketed to 7.5 percent of gross domestic product.\nAdditional evidence of these practices could be observed in ﬁnancial institutions\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS26throughout Japan. First announcing questionable and nonperforming loans of\n$136 billion in 1994, Japanese authorities admitted to an alarming $400 billion\ntotal a year later. Coupled with a then-crippled stock market, cooling real estate\nvalues, and dramatic slowdowns in the economy, investors saw opportunity in\na depreciating yen, subsequently adding selling pressure to neighbor currencies.\nWhen their own asset bubble collapsed, asset prices fell by $10 trillion, with\nthe fall in real estate prices accounting for nearly 65% of the total decline—the\nlosses were worth two years of national output. This fall in asset prices sparked\nthe banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early 1990s and then developed into a\nfull-blown, systemic crisis in 1997, following the failure of a number of high-proﬁle\nﬁnancial institutions. In response, Japanese monetary authorities issued rhetoric on\npotentially increasing benchmark interest rates in hopes of defending the domestic\ncurrency valuation. Unfortunately, these considerations never materialized and a\nshortfall ensued. Sparked mainly by an announcement of a managed ﬂoat of the Thai\nbaht, the slide snowballed as central bank reserves evaporated and currency price\nlevels became unsustainable in light of downside selling pressure.\nCurrency Crisis\nFollowing mass short speculation and attempted intervention, the aforementioned\nAsian economies were left ruined and momentarily incapacitated. The Thailand baht,\na once-prized possession, was devalued by as much as 48 percent, even slumping\ncloser to a 100% fall at the turn of the new year.

Additionally, it\nshowed the inability of central banks to successfully intervene in currency valuations\nwith the absence of secure economic fundamentals and overwhelming market forces.\nToday, with the assistance of IMF reparation packages and the implementation of\nstricter requirements, Asia’s four little dragons are healthy once again. With inﬂa-\ntionary benchmarks and a revived exporting market, Southeast Asia is building back\nits once prominent stature among the world’s industrialized economic regions. With\nthe experience of evaporating currency reserves under their belt, the Asian tigers\nnow take active initiatives to ensure that there is large pot of reserves on hand in\ncase speculators attempt to attack their currencies once again.\n■Introduction of the Euro (1999)\nThe introduction of the euro was a monumental achievement, marking the largest\nmonetary changeover ever. The euro was ofﬁcially launched as an electronic trading\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS28currency on January 1, 1999. Euro notes and coins were put into circulation in 2002.\nThe 11 initial member states were: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy,\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, and Finland. As of 2015, there\nare 17 countries in the Eurozone. Each country ﬁxed its currency to a speciﬁc\nconversion rate against the euro, and a common monetary policy governed by the\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) was adopted. To many economists, the system would\nideally include all of the original 15 EU nations, but the United Kingdom, Sweden,\nand Denmark decided to keep their own currencies. In deciding whether to adopt\nthe euro, EU members have many important factors to consider.\nThe 1993 Maastricht Treaty sets out ﬁve main convergence criteria for member\nstates to participate in the European Monetary Union (EMU):\nMaastricht Treaty: C onvergence Criteria\n■The country’s government budget deﬁcit could not be greater than 3% of GDP.\n■The country’s government debt could not be larger than 60% of GDP.\n■The country’s exchange rate had to be maintained within ERM bands without any\nrealignment for two years prior to joining.\n■The country’s inﬂation rate could not be higher than 1.5% above the average\ninﬂation rate of the three EU countries with the lowest inﬂation rates.\n■The country’s long-term interest rate on government bonds could not be higher\nthan 2% above the average of the comparable rates in the three countries with the\nlowest inﬂation.\nAlthough the ease of traveling is one of the most attractive reasons to join the\neuro, being part of the monetary union provides other beneﬁts:\n■It eliminates exchange rate ﬂuctuations, providing a more stable environment to\ntrade within the euro area.\n■The purging of all exchange rate risk within the zone allows businesses to plan\ninvestment decisions with greater certainty.\n■Transaction costs also diminish, mainly those relating to foreign exchange\noperations, hedging operations, cross-border payments, and the management of\nseveral currency accounts.\n■Prices become more transparent as consumers and businesses can compare prices\nacross countries more easily, which, in turn, increases competition.\n■A huge single currency market becomes more attractive for foreign investors.\n■The economy’s magnitude and stability allow the ECB to control inﬂation with\nlower interest rates, thanks to increased credibility.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS\nk\nk29\nk\nk\nFIGURE 2.6 EURUSD Price Since Launch\nSource: eSignal\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS30Yet the euro is not without its limitations. Leaving aside political sovereignty\nissues, the main problem is that, by adopting the euro, a nation essentially forfeits\nany independent monetary policy. Since each country’s economy is not perfectly\ncorrelated to the EMU’s economy, a nation might ﬁnd the ECB hiking interest\nrates during a domestic recession. This can be particularly true for many of the\nsmaller nations. As a result, countries try to rely more heavily on ﬁscal policy, but\nthe efﬁciency of ﬁscal policy is limited when it is not effectively combined with\nmonetary policy. This inefﬁciency is further exacerbated by the 3% of GDP limit on\nbudget deﬁcits, as stipulated by the Stability and Growth Pact.\nSome concerns also subsist regarding the ECB’s effectiveness as a central bank.\nThe central bank strives for a 2% inﬂation target, but in the past 15 years, it strayed\naway from this level often. Also, from 1999 to late 2002, a lack of conﬁdence\nin the union’s currency (and in the union itself) led to a 24% depreciation, from\napproximately $1.15 to the euro in January 1999 to $0.88 in May 2000, forcing\nthe ECB to intervene in foreign exchange markets in the last few months of 2000.\nFigure 2.6 shows a daily chart of the euro since it was launched in 1999.\nSince 2000, things have greatly changed, with the euro trading at a premium to\nthe dollar, but quantitative easing in 2014 put the currency back in a downtrend\nversus the dollar. Some analysts claim that the euro will one day replace the dollar\nas the world’s dominant international currency, and while we believe it will have a\ngreater share in reserve portfolios, we doubt that this will be likely.\n31CHAPTER 3\nWhat Moves the\nCurrency Market?\nNow that we know a little bit about the history of the forex market, let’s take a\nlook at what moves currencies. There are two primary ways to analyze ﬁnancial\nmarkets: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis is rooted\nin understanding underlying economic conditions, while technical analysis uses\nhistorical prices to predict future movements. For as long as technical analysis\nhas been around, there has been an ongoing debate as to which methodology\nis more successful. Short-term traders prefer to use technical analysis, focusing\ntheir strategies primarily on price action, while medium-term traders tend to use\nfundamental analysis to determine a currency’s current and future valuation.\nBefore implementing successful trading strategies, it is important to understand\nwhat drives the movements of currencies in the foreign exchange market. The\nbest strategies tend to be the ones that combine both fundamental and technical\nanalysis. Textbook perfect technical formations have failed too often because of\nmajor fundamental news and events like U.S. nonfarm payrolls. But trading on\nfundamentals alone can also be risky. There will oftentimes be sharp gyrations in\nthe price of currency on a day when there are no news or economic reports. This\nsuggests that the price action is driven by nothing more than ﬂows, sentiment, and\npattern formations. Therefore, it is very important for technical traders to be aware\nof the key economic data or events that are scheduled for release, and, in turn,\nfor fundamental traders to be aware of important technical levels that the general\nmarket may be focusing on.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?32■Fundamental Analysis\nFundamental analysis focuses on the economic, social, and political forces that drive\nsupply and demand. Those using fundamental analysis as a trading tool look at\nvarious macroeconomic indicators such as growth rates, interest rates, inﬂation,\nand unemployment. We outlined some of the most important economic releases\nin the ﬁrst chapter of this book. Fundamental analysts will combine all of this\ninformation to assess current and future performance. This requires a lot of work\nand thorough analysis, as there is no single set of beliefs that guides fundamental\nanalysis. Traders employing fundamental analysis need to continually keep abreast\nof news and announcements, as they can indicate potential changes to the economic,\nsocial, and political environment. All traders should be aware of the broad economic\nconditions before placing trades. This is especially important for day traders who\nare trying to make trading decisions based on news events because even though\nFederal Reserve Monetary Policy decisions are always important, if the rate move is\ncompletely priced into the market, then the actual reaction in the EURUSD could\nbe nominal.\nTaking a step back, currencies move primarily based on supply and demand.\nThat is, on the most fundamental level, a currency rallies because there is demand\nfor that currency. Regardless of whether the demand is for hedging, speculative,\nor conversion purposes, true movements are based on the need for the currency.\nCurrency values decrease when there is excess supply. Supply and demand should be\nthe real determinants for predicting future movements. However, how to predict\nsupply and demand is not as simple as many would think. There are many factors\nthat contribute to the net supply and demand for a currency. This includes capital\nﬂows, trade ﬂows, speculative, and hedging needs.\nFor example, the U.S. dollar was very strong (against the euro) between 1999\nand the end of 2001. This rally was driven primarily by the dot-com boom and the\ndesire by foreign investors to participate in these elevated returns. This demand\nfor U.S. assets required foreign investors to sell their local currencies and purchase\nU.S. dollars. Since the end of 2001, geopolitical uncertainty arose, the United States\nstarted cutting interest rates, and foreign investors started to sell U.S. assets in\nsearch of higher yields elsewhere. This required foreign investors to sell U.S. dollars,\nincreasing supply and lowering the dollar’s value against other major currency pairs.\nThe availability of funding or interest in buying a currency is a major factor that can\nimpact the direction that a currency trades. It was one of the primary drivers of the\nU.S. dollar between 2002 and 2005, making foreign ofﬁcial purchases of U.S. assets\n(also known as the Treasury International Capital Flow, or TIC data) an important\neconomic indicator.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?33Capital and Trade Flows\nCapital ﬂows and trade ﬂows constitute a country’s balance of payments, which\nquantiﬁes the amount of demand for a currency over a given period of time.\nTheoretically, a balance of payments equal to zero is required for a currency to\nmaintain its current valuation. A negative balance of payments number, on the other\nhand, indicates that capital is leaving the economy at a more rapid rate than it is\nentering, and hence, it should fall in value.\nThis is particularly important in current conditions (at the time of this book’s\npublication), where the United States is running a consistently large trade deﬁcit\nwithout sufﬁcient foreign inﬂow to fund that deﬁcit. As a result of this very problem,\nthe trade-weighted dollar index fell 22% in value between 2003 and 2005. The\nJapanese yen is another good example. As one of the world’s largest exporters, Japan\nruns a very high trade surplus. Therefore, despite a zero interest rate policy that\nprevents capital ﬂows from increasing, the yen has a natural tendency to trade lower\nbased on trade ﬂows, which is the other side of the equation. To be more speciﬁc,\nfollowing is a more detailed explanation of what capital and trade ﬂows encompass.\nCapital Flows\nCapital ﬂows measure the net amount of a currency that is being purchased or sold\ndue to capital investments. A positive capital ﬂow balance implies that foreign inﬂows\nof physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed outﬂows. A negative\ncapital ﬂow balance indicates that there are more physical or portfolio investments\nbought by domestic investors than foreign investors. There are generally two types\nof capital ﬂows—physical ﬂows and portfolio ﬂows (which are further segmented\ninto equity markets and ﬁxed-income markets).\nPhysical Flows\nPhysical ﬂows encompass actual foreign direct investments by corporations such as\ninvestments in real estate, manufacturing, and local acquisitions. All of these require\nthat a foreign corporation sell its local currency and buy the foreign currency, which\nleads to movements in the FX market. This is particularly important for global\nmergers and corporate acquisitions that involve more cash than stock.\nPhysical ﬂows are important to watch, as they represent the underlying changes\nin actual physical investment activity. These ﬂows shift in response to changes in\neach country’s ﬁnancial health and growth opportunities. Changes in local laws that\nencourage foreign investment also serve to promote physical ﬂows. For example,\ndue to China’s entry into the WTO, its foreign investment laws have been relaxed.\nAs a result of China’s cheap labor and attractive revenue opportunities (population\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?34of over 1 billion), corporations globally have ﬂooded China with investments. From\nan FX perspective, in order to fund investments in China, foreign corporations need\nto sell their local currency and buy Chinese renminbi (RMB).\nPortfolio Flows in Equity Markets\nAs technology has enabled greater ease with respect to transportation of capital,\ninvesting in global equity markets has become far more feasible. Accordingly, a\nrallying stock market in any part of the world serves as an ideal opportunity for all,\nregardless of geographic location. The result of this has become a strong correlation\nbetween a country’s equity markets and its currency: If the equity market is rising,\ninvestment dollars generally come in to seize the opportunity. Alternatively, falling\nequity markets could prompt domestic investors to sell their shares of local publicly\ntraded ﬁrms to take advantage of investment opportunities abroad.\nThe attraction of equity markets over ﬁxed-income markets has increased across\nthe years. Since the early 1990s, the ratio of foreign transactions in U.S. government\nbonds over U.S. equities has declined from 10 to 1 to 2 to 1. As indicated in\nFigure 3.1, it is evident that the Dow had a high correlation (of approximately 81%)\nwith the U.S. dollar (against the EUR) between 1994 and 1999. In addition, from\n1991–1999, the Dow increased 300%, while the USD index appreciated nearly 30%\nfor the same time period. As a result, currency traders closely followed the global\nequity markets to predict short and intermediate term equity-based capital ﬂows.\nHowever, this relationship shifted after the tech bubble burst in the United States as\n1/31/9412500 1. 15\n1. 10\n1 .05\n1 .00\n0.95\n0.90\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n0.70\n0.6511500\n10500\n9500\n8500\n7500\n6500\n5500\n4500\n3500\n6/30/94 11/30/94 4/28/95 9/29/95 2/29/96 7/31/96 12/31/96Dow Jones and USDEUR\n5/30/97 10/31/97 3/31/98 8/31/98 1/29/99 6/30/99 11/30/99INDU Index Px Last USDEUR Curncy\nFIGURE 3.1 Dow and USDEUR\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?35foreign investors remained relatively risk averse causing a lower correlation between\nthe performance of the U.S. equity market and the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, a\nrelationship still exists, making it important for all traders to keep an eye on global\nmarket performances in search of intermarket opportunities.\nPortfolio Flows in Fixed-Income Markets\nJust as the equity market is correlated to exchange rate movement, so too is the\nﬁxed-income market. In times of global uncertainty, ﬁxed-income investments can\nbecome particularly appealing, due to the inherent safety they possess. As a result,\neconomies boasting the most valuable ﬁxed-income opportunities will be capable of\nattracting foreign investment—which will naturally ﬁrst require the purchasing of\nthe country’s respective currency.\nA good gauge of ﬁxed-income capital ﬂows are the short- and long-term yields of\ninternational government bonds. It is important to monitor the spread differential\nbetween the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the yield on foreign bonds because\ninternational investors tend to move money from one country to another in search\nof the highest yielding assets. When U.S. assets have one of the highest yields,\nthis encourages more investments in U.S. ﬁnancial instruments, hence beneﬁting\nthe U.S. dollar. When the United States has the lowest yields, this discourages\ninvestments. Investors can also use short-term yields, such as the spreads on 2-year\ngovernment bonds, to gauge the short-term ﬂow of international funds. Aside from\ngovernment bond yields, Fed fund futures can also be used to estimate movement\nof U.S. funds, as they price in the expectation of future Fed interest rate policy.\nEuribor futures are a barometer for the Euro region’s expected future interest rates\nand can give an indication of EU future policy movements. We will discuss how to\nuse ﬁxed-income products to trade FX further in our strategy section.\nTrade Flows: Measuring Exports versus Imports\nTrade ﬂows are the basis of all international transactions. Just as the investment\nenvironment of a given economy is a key driver of its currency valuation, trade ﬂows\nrepresent a country’s net trade balance. Countries that are net exporters—meaning\nthey sell more goods abroad than they buy—will experience a net trade surplus.\nCountries that are net exporters are more likely to have their currency rise in value\nbecause from the perspective of international trade, their currency is being bought\nmore than it is sold. This impacts currency ﬂows because international clients buying\nthe exported product/service must ﬁrst buy the currency of the exporting nation.\nCountries who are net importers purchase more goods abroad than they sell,\ncreating a trade deﬁcit. These nations will generally see more downward than\nupward pressure on their currencies because in order to purchase these foreign\ngoods, importers must sell their own currency and purchase the currency of the\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?36country from which they are buying the good or service. This accordingly drives\ndown the value of the currency when all else is equal. This concept is important\nbecause it is one of primary reasons why many economists say that certain currencies\nneed to fall to reverse burgeoning trade deﬁcits.\nTo understand this further, let’s imagine that the UK economy is booming,\nand its stock market is performing well. Meanwhile, in the United States, a\nlackluster economy is creating a shortage of investment opportunities. In this type\nof environment U.S. investors will feel more inclined to sell their U.S. dollars and\nbuy British pounds to participate in the outperformance of the UK economy. When\nthey elect to do so, it results in the outﬂow of capital from the United States and\nthe inﬂow of capital into the United Kingdom. From an exchange rate perspective,\nthis would induce a fall in the USD coupled with a rise in the GBP, as demand for\nUSD declines and the demand for GBP increases, translating into strength for the\nGBP/USD currency pair.\nEven day and swing traders will ﬁnd it valuable to keep up with incoming\neconomic reports from the major economies.\nTrading Tip: Charting Economic Surprises\nOne way for traders to stay on top of economic trends is to chart economic data\nsurprises against price action. Figure 3.2 illustrates how this can be done. The chart\ngraphs how much an economic indicator has deviated from its consensus forecast,\nor the ‘‘surprise,’’ and stacks them on the same side and graphs price (blue line)\naction when the data was release against the surprise, with a simple regression line\n(white line). This can be done for all of the major currency pairs and provides a\nvisual guide to understanding whether price action has been in line with economic\nfundamentals and can be used as a guide to future price action. Economic data can\nbe found on the calendars of any major forex website, and price action can generally\nbe downloaded from your trading platforms.\nAccording to Figure 3.2, in November of 2004, there were 14 out of 15 positive\neconomic surprises and yet the dollar sold off against the euro during the month\nof December, which was the month in which the economic data were released.\nAlthough this methodology is not exact, the analysis is simple and past charts\nhave yielded some extremely useful clues to future price action. Figure 3.3 shows\nhow the EURUSD moved the following month. As you can see, the EURUSD\nquickly corrected itself during the month of January, indicating that the fundamental\ndivergence from price action that occurred in December proved to be quite useful\nto dollar longs, which harvested almost 600 pips as the euro quickly retracted a large\npart of its gains in January. This method of analysis, called variant perception, was ﬁrst\ninvented by the legendary hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, who produced\n24% average rates return for 30 consecutive years.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?37US Dollar Data and EURUSD\n1 .3700\n1 .3600\n1 .3500\n1 .3400\n1 .3300\n1 .3200\n1. 3 10 0\n1 .3000\n–100%–26.11%0.00%0.00%1.41%1.46%2.56%2.81%3.55%4.18%14.29%16.67%33.33%43.48%50.25%140.00%\n–50% 0% 50%Durable Goods\nEmpire State Manufacturing\nPhilly Fed\nLeading Economic Indicators\nPersonal Income\nIndustrial Production\nISM Non-Manufacturing\nCurrent Account\nExisting Home Sales\nGDP Annualized\nU.

Large positive and negative\nsurprises in economic data can often yield clues to future price action. If you go back\nand look at the EURUSD charts, you will see that the record current account deﬁcits\nin October 2004 were the catalyst that sent the dollar plunging over the next two\nmonths. In many ways, economic fundamentals matter more in the foreign exchange\nmarket than in any other market, and charts such as these could provide valuable\nclues to price direction. Generally, the 15 most important economic indices are\nchosen from each region, and then a price regression line is superimposed over the\npast 20 days of price data.\n■Technical Analysis\nPrior to the mid-1980s, fundamental traders dominated the FX market. However,\nwith the rising popularity of technical analysis and the advent of new technologies,\nthe inﬂuence of technical trading on the FX market has increased signiﬁcantly. The\navailability of high leverage also led to an increased number of high frequency and\nmomentum. They have become active participants in the FX market, with the acute\nability to inﬂuence currency prices.\nUnlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses on the study of price\nmovements. Technical analysts use historical currency data to forecast the direction\nof future prices. The underlying belief behind technical analysis is that all current\nmarket information is already reﬂected in the price of that currency; therefore,\nstudying price action is all that is required to make informed trading decisions. In a\nnutshell, technical analysis assumes that history will repeat itself.\nTechnical analysis is an extremely popular tool used by short- and medium-term\ntraders for analyzing the forex market. It works especially well in the currency\nmarkets because short-term currency price ﬂuctuations are primarily driven by\nhuman emotions or market perceptions. The primary tool in technical analysis\nis price and charts. Traders will look for trends and patterns to identify trading\nopportunities. The most basic concept of technical analysis is that markets have a\ntendency to trend. Being able to identify trends in their earliest stage of development\nis the key to technical analysis. Range trading is also very popular, and similar tools\ncan be used to identify these setups. Technical analysis integrates price action and\nmomentum to construct a pictorial representation of past currency price action and\nto use this information to predict future performance. Technical analysis tools such\nas Fibonacci retracement levels, moving averages, oscillators, candlestick charts, and\nBollinger bands provide further information on the value of the emotional extremes\nof buyers and sellers. It also helps to gauge when greed and fear are the strongest.\nThere are basically two types of markets, trending or range bound, and in the trade\nparameters section, we outline some rules that can help traders determine the type\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?39of market they trading in right now and the sort of trading opportunities they should\nbe looking for.\nIs Technical Analysis or Fundamental Analysis Better?\nNo one will ever win the age-long battle between technical and fundamental analysis.\nHowever, most individual traders will start trading with technical analysis because\nit is easier to understand and does not require hours of study. Technical analysts can\nalso follow many currencies and markets at one time, whereas fundamental analysts\ntend to focus on a few pairs due to the overwhelming amount of data in the market.\nNonetheless, technical analysis works well because the currency market tends to\ndevelop strong trends. Once technical analysis is mastered, it can be applied with\nequal ease to any time frame or currency traded.\nHowever, it is important to take both strategies into consideration, as fundamental\nanalysis can trigger technical movements such as breakouts or reversal in trends.\nTechnical analysis, on the other hand, can also explain moves that fundamentals\ncannot, especially in quiet markets, causing resistance in trends or unexplainable\nmovements. For example, as shown in Figure 3.4, in the days leading up to\nSeptember 11, USDJPY had just broken out of a triangle formation and looked\npoised to head higher. However, as the chart indicates, instead of breaking higher as\ntechnicians may have anticipated, USDJPY broke down following the September 11,\n2001, terrorist attacks and ended up hitting a low of 115.81 from a high of 121.88\non September 10.\n■Currency Forecasting—What Bookworms\nand Economists Look At\nFor more avid students of foreign exchange who want to learn more about\nfundamental analysis and valuing currencies, this section examines the different\nmodels of currency forecasting used by analysts of the major investment banks.\nThere are seven major models for forecasting currencies, which include the balance\nof payments theory, purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, the monetary\nmodel, the real interest rate differential model, the asset market model, and the\ncurrency substitution model.\nBalance of Payments Theory\nThe balance of payments theory states that exchange rates should be at their\nequilibrium level, which is the rate that produces a stable current account balance.\nCountries with trade deﬁcits experience a run on their foreign exchange reserves\ndue to the fact that exporters to that nation must sell that nation’s currency in order\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?k\nk40k\nk\nFIGURE 3.4 USDJPY September 11th Chart\nSource: eSignal\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?41to receive payment. The cheaper currency makes the nation’s exports less expensive\nabroad, which in turn fuels exports and brings the currency into balance.\nWhat Is the Balance of Payments (BOP)?\nThe balance of payments account is divided into two parts: the current account and\nthe capital account. The current account measures trade in tangible, visible items\nsuch as cars and manufactured goods; the trade balance is the surplus or deﬁcit\nbetween exports and imports. The capital account measures ﬂows of money, such\nas investments for stocks or bonds. Balance of payments data can be found on the\nwebsite of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nTrade Flows\nThe trade balance of a country shows the net difference over a period of time\nbetween a nation’s exports and imports. When a country imports more than it\nexports, the trade balance is negative or is in a deﬁcit. If the country exports more\nthan it imports, the trade balance is positive or is in a surplus. The trade balance\nreﬂects the redistribution of wealth among countries and is a major channel through\nwhich the macroeconomic policies of a country may affect another.\nIn general, if a country has a trade deﬁcit, it is considered to be unfavorable, since\nit negatively impacts the value of the nation’s currency. For example, if U.S. trade\nﬁgures show greater imports than exports, more dollars ﬂow out of the United\nStates and the value of the U.S. currency depreciates. A positive trade balance,\nin comparison, will affect the dollar by causing it to appreciate against the other\ncurrencies.\nCapital Flows\nIn addition to trade ﬂows, there are also capital ﬂows that occur among countries.\nThey record a nation’s incoming and outgoing investment ﬂows, such as payments\nfor entire or parts of companies, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, real estate, and\nfactories. Capital ﬂows are inﬂuenced by many factors, including the ﬁnancial and\neconomic climate of other countries, and can be in the form of physical or portfolio\ninvestments. In general, in developing countries, the composition of capital ﬂows\ntends to be skewed toward foreign direct investment (FDI) and bank loans. For\ndeveloped countries, due to the strength of the equity and ﬁxed-income markets,\nstocks and bonds appear to be more important than bank loans and FDI.\nEquity Markets\nEquity markets have a signiﬁcant impact on exchange rate movements because\nthey are a major place for high-volume currency movements. Their importance is\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?42considerable for the currencies of countries with developed capital markets, where\na great amount of capital inﬂows and outﬂows occur, and where foreign investors\nare major participants. The amount of the foreign investment ﬂows in the equity\nmarkets is dependent on the general health and growth of the market, reﬂecting\nthe well-being of companies and particular sectors. Movements of currencies occur\nwhen foreign investors move their money to a particular equity market. Thus,\nthey convert their capital in a domestic currency and push the demand for it\nhigher, making the currency appreciate. When the equity markets are experiencing\nrecessions, however, foreign investors tend to ﬂee, thus converting back to their\nhome currency and pushing the domestic currency down.\nFixed-Income (Bond) Markets\nThe effect that ﬁxed-income markets have on currencies is similar to that of the\nequity markets and is a result of capital movements. An investor’s interest in the\nﬁxed-income market depends on the company’s speciﬁcs and credit rating, as well as\non the general health of the economy and the country’s interest rates. The movement\nof foreign capital into and out of ﬁxed-income markets leads to change in the demand\nand supply for currencies, hence impacting the currencies’ exchange rates.\nSummary of Trade and Capital Flows\nDetermining and understanding a country’s balance of payments is perhaps the\nmost important and useful tool for those interested in fundamental analysis. Any\ninternational transaction gives rise to two offsetting entries: trade ﬂow balance\n(current account) and capital ﬂow balance (capital account). If the trade ﬂow balance\nis a negative outﬂow, the country is buying more from foreigners than it sells\n(imports exceed exports). When it is a positive inﬂow, the country is selling more\nthan it buys (exports exceed imports). The capital ﬂow balance is positive when\nforeign inﬂows of physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed that\ncountry’s outﬂows. A capital ﬂow is negative when a country buys more physical or\nportfolio investments than are sold to foreign investors.\nThese two entries, trade and capital ﬂow, when added together signify a country’s\nbalance of payments. In theory, the two entries should balance and add up to zero\nin order to provide for the maintenance of the status quo in a nation’s economy and\ncurrency rates.\nIn general, countries might experience positive or negative trade, as well as\npositive or negative capital ﬂow balances. In order to minimize the net effect of\nthe two on the exchange rates, a country should try to maintain a balance between\nthe two. For example, in the United States, there is a substantial trade deﬁcit, as\nmore is imported than is exported. When the trade balance is negative, the country\nis buying more from foreigners than it sells, and therefore it needs to ﬁnance its\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?43deﬁcit. This negative trade ﬂow might be offset by a positive capital ﬂow into the\ncountry, as foreigners buy either physical or portfolio investments. Therefore, the\nUnited States seeks to minimize its trade deﬁcit and maximize its capital inﬂows,\nwith hopes that the two will balance out.\nA change in this balance is extremely signiﬁcant and carries ramiﬁcations that\nrun deep into economic policy and currency exchange levels. The net result of the\ndifference between the trade and capital ﬂows, positive or negative, will impact the\ndirection in which the nation’s currency will move. If the overall trade and capital\nbalance is negative, it will result in a depreciation of the nation’s currency, and if\npositive, it will lead to an appreciation of the currency.\nClearly, a change in the balance of payments carries a direct effect for currency\nlevels. It is therefore possible for any investor to observe economic data relating to\nthis balance and interpret the results that will occur. Data relating to capital and\ntrade ﬂows should be followed most closely. For instance, if an analyst observes\nan increase in the U.S. trade deﬁcit and a decrease in the capital ﬂows, a balance\nof payments deﬁcit would occur, and as a result, an investor may anticipate a\ndepreciation of the dollar.\nLimitations of BOP Model\nThe BOP model mainly focuses on traded goods and services, while ignoring\ninternational capital ﬂows. Indeed, international capital ﬂows often dwarfed trade\nﬂows in the currency markets toward the end of the 1990s, and this oftentimes\nbalanced out the current account of debtor nations like the United States.\nFor example, in 1999, 2000, and 2001, the United States maintained a large\ncurrent account deﬁcit while the Japanese ran a large current account surplus.\nHowever, during this same period in time the U.S. dollar rose against the yen even\nthough trade ﬂows were running against the dollar. The reason was that capital ﬂows\nbalanced out trade ﬂows, thus defying the BOP’s forecasting model for a period of\ntime. Indeed, the increase in capital ﬂows has given rise to the asset market model .\nNote: It is probably a misnomer to call this theory the balance of payments theory\nsince it only takes into account the current account balance, not the actual balance\nof payments. However, until the 1990s capital ﬂows played a very small role in the\nworld economy, so the main statistic viewed was the trade balance, which made up\nthe bulk of the balance of payments for most nations.\nPurchasing Power Parity\nThepurchasing power parity (PPP) theory is based on the belief that foreign exchange\nrates should be determined by the relative prices of a similar basket of goods between\ntwo countries. Any change in a nation’s inﬂation rate should be balanced by an\nopposite change in that nation’s exchange rate. Therefore, according to this theory,\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?44when a country’s prices are rising due to inﬂation, that country’s exchange rate\nshould depreciate in order to return to parity.\nPPP’s Basket of Goods\nThe basket of goods and services priced for the PPP exercise is a sample of all goods\nand services covered by GDP. It includes consumer goods and services, government\nservices, equipment goods, and construction projects. More speciﬁcally, consumer\nitems include food, beverages, tobacco, clothing, footwear, rents, water supply,\ngas, electricity, medical goods and services, furniture and furnishings, household\nappliances, personal transport equipment, fuel, transport services, recreational\nequipment, recreational and cultural services, telephone services, education services,\ngoods and services for personal care and household operation, and repair and\nmaintenance services.\nBig Mac Index\nOne of the most well-known examples of PPP is The Economist ’s Big Mac Index. The\nBig Mac PPP calculates the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the\nsame in America as elsewhere. Comparing these with actual rates helps to signal if\na currency is under- or overvalued. As described by The Economist, the index is a\nlightheartedly guide to currency valuation. It was never intended as a precise gauge\nof currency misalignment, but merely a tool to make exchange-rate theory more\ndigestible.\nFor example, in January 2015, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and\nChinese yuan was approximately 6.20. At the time, a Big Mac cost $4.79 in the\nUnited States. In China, the same burger cost 17.15 yuan, or approximately $2.77\nat market exchange. This means that based on the comparison between the two\nburger prices, the Chinese yuan was undervalued by 42%.\nOECD Purchasing Power Parity Index\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) releases a\nmore formal index. Under a joint OECD-Eurostat PPP Program, the OECD and\nEurostat share the responsibility for calculating PPPs. Their latest information on\nwhich currencies are under- or overvalued against the U.S. dollar can be found\non the OECD website at www.oecd.org. The OECD publishes a table that shows\nthe price levels for the major industrialized countries. Each column shows the\nnumber of speciﬁed monetary units needed in each of the countries listed to buy\nthe same representative basket of consumer goods and services. In each case,\nthe representative basket costs a hundred units in the country whose currency is\nspeciﬁed. The chart that is then created compares the PPP of a currency with its\nactual exchange rate. The chart is updated weekly to reﬂect the current exchange\nrate. It is also updated about twice a year to reﬂect new estimates of PPP. The\nPPP estimates are taken from studies carried out by the OECD; however, it should\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?45not be taken as deﬁnitive. Different methods of calculation will arrive at different\nPPP rates.\nAccording to the OECD’s data as of April 17, 2015, the PPP value of the\nAustralian dollar versus the U.S. dollar based on GDP is 0.6712. At the time, the\nAUD/USD exchange rate was 0.7812. Using this model of valuation, this indicates\nthat the Australian dollar was 14% overvalued.\nLimitations to Using Purchasing Power Parity\nPPP theory should only be used for long-term fundamental analysis. While the\neconomic forces behind PPP will eventually equalize the purchasing power of\ncurrencies, this can take many years. A time horizon of 5–10 years is typical.\nPPP’s major weakness is that it assumes goods can be traded easily, without regard\nto such things as tariffs, quotas, or taxes. For example, when the U.S. government\nannounces new tariffs on imported steel, the cost of domestic manufactured goods\ngoes up; but those increases will not be reﬂected in the U.S. PPP tables.\nThere are other factors that must also be considered when weighing PPP: inﬂation,\ninterest rate differentials, economic releases/reports, asset markets, trade ﬂows,\nand political developments. Indeed, PPP is just one of several theories traders should\nuse when determining exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Parity\nThe interest rate parity theory states that if two different currencies have different\ninterest rates, then that difference should be reﬂected in the premium or discount\nfor the forward exchange rate to prevent riskless arbitrage.\nFor example, if U.S. interest rates are 3% and Japanese interest rates are 1%,\nthen the U.S. dollar should depreciate against the Japanese yen by 2% in order\nto prevent riskless arbitrage. This future exchange rate is reﬂected in the forward\nexchange rate stated today. In our example, the forward exchange rate of the dollar\nis said to be at discount because it buys fewer Japanese yen in the forward rate than\nit does in the spot rate. The yen is said to be at a premium.\nInterest rate parity has shown very little proof of effectiveness in recent years.\nOftentimes, currencies with higher interest rates rise and attract incoming invest-\nment, while currencies with low and falling interest rates decline as outﬂows slow.\nThe Monetary Model\nAccording to the monetary model, exchange rates are determined by a nation’s\nmonetary policy. The premise is that countries that follow a stable monetary policy\nover time should have appreciating currencies. Countries that have erratic monetary\npolicies or excessively expansionist policies should see the value of their currency\ndepreciate.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?46How to Use the Monetary Model\nThree factors inﬂuence exchange rates under this theory:\n1. A nation’s money supply\n2. Expected future levels of a nation’s money supply\n3. The growth rate of a nation’s money supply\nAll of these factors are key to understanding and spotting a monetary trend that\nmay force a change in exchange rates. For example, let’s assume that the Japanese\neconomy has been slipping in and out of recession for over a decade. Interest rates\nare near zero and annual budget deﬁcits prevent the Japanese from spending their\nway out of recession, which leaves only one tool left at the disposal of Japanese\nofﬁcials determined to revive Japan’s economy: printing more money. By buying\nstocks and bonds, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is increasing the nation’s money supply,\nwhich produces inﬂation, and this forces a change in the exchange rate. The example\nin Figure 3.5 illustrates the effect of money supply changes to the Japanese yen using\nthe monetary model.\nIndeed, it is in the area of excessive expansionary monetary policy that the\nmonetary model is most successful. One of the only ways a country can keep\nits currency from sharply devaluing is by pursuing a tight monetary policy. For\nexample, during the Asian Currency Crisis, the Hong Kong dollar came under\nattack from speculators. Hong Kong ofﬁcials raised interest rates to 300% to halt\nthe Hong Kong dollar from being dislodged from its peg to the U.S. dollar. The\ntactic worked perfectly, as speculators were cleared out by such sky-high interest\nrates. The downside was that the Hong Kong economy would slide into recession.\nBut in the end, the peg held and the monetary model worked.\nLimitations of the Monetary Model\nVery few economists rely solely on this model because it does not take into account\ntrade ﬂows and capital ﬂows. For example, throughout 2014 Australia had higher\ninterest rates, growth rates, and inﬂation rates than both the United States and the\nEuropean Union, yet, the AUD appreciated in value against both the dollar and the\neuro. Indeed, the monetary model has greatly struggled since the dawn of freely\nCHANGE IN MONEY\nSUPPL Y\nY en Is Printed Increase in Y en Creates\nInflationY en Depreciates in ValueCHANGE IN EXCHANGE\nRATECHANGE IN PRICE\nLEVEL\nFIGURE 3.5 Monetary Model\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?47ﬂoating currencies. The model holds that high interest rates signal growing inﬂation,\nwhich it often does, followed by a depreciating currency. But this does not take into\naccount the capital inﬂows that would take effect as a result of higher interest yields\nor of an equity market that may be thriving in a booming economy—thus causing\nthe currency to possibly appreciate.\nIn any case, the monetary model is one of several valuation tools that can be\nemployed in tandem with other models to determine the direction an exchange rate\nis heading.\nReal Interest Rate Differential Model\nAccording to the real interest rate differential theory, exchange rate movements are\ndetermined by a country’s interest rate. The idea is that countries with high interest\nrates should see their currency appreciate in value, while countries with low interest\nrates should see their currency depreciate in value.\nBasics of the Model\nThe basic premise of the model is that when a country raises its interest rates,\ninternational investors will buy that currency because they ﬁnd its yield more\nattractive. When a country lowers interest rates, they sell the currency. Figure 3.6\nUK\nUKInterest Rates vs. United States Eurozone\nEurozone2003 Percent.

The Australian dollar had the\nlargest basis point spread and also had the highest return against the U.S. dollar,\nwhich seems to vindicate the model, as investors bought up higher-yielding Aussie.\nThe same can be said for the New Zealand dollar, which also had a higher yield\nthan the U.S. dollar and gained 27% against USD. Yet the model becomes less\nconvincing when comparing the euro, which gained 20% against the dollar (more\nthan every currency except NZD), even though its basis point differential was\nonly 100 points. The model then comes under serious question when comparing\nthe British pound and the Japanese yen. The yen differential is –100, and yet it\nappreciated almost 12% against the dollar. Meanwhile, the British pound gained\nonly 11% against the dollar even though it had a whopping 275 point interest rate\ndifferential.\nThis model also stresses that one of the key factors in determining the severity of\nan exchange rate’s response to a shift in interest rates is the expected persistence of\nthat shift. Simply put, a rise in interest rates that is expected to last for ﬁve years\nwill have a much larger impact on the exchange rate than if that rise were expected\nto last for only one year.\nLimitations to the Interest Rate Model\nThere is a great deal of debate among international economists over whether there\nis a strong and statistically signiﬁcant link between changes in a nation’s interest rate\nand currency price. The main weakness of this model is that it does not take into\naccount a nation’s current account balance, relying on capital ﬂows instead. Indeed,\nthe model tends to overemphasize capital ﬂows at the expense of numerous other\nfactors, such as political stability, inﬂation, and poor economic growth. Absent these\ntypes of factors, the model can be very useful, since it is quite logical to conclude\nthat an investor will naturally gravitate toward the investment vehicle that pays a\nhigher reward.\nThe Asset Market Model\nThe basic premise of the asset market model theory is that the ﬂow of funds into the\nﬁnancial assets of a country such as equities and bonds increases the demand for that\ncountry’s currency (and vice versa). As proof, advocates point out that the amount\nof funds that are placed in investment products such as stocks and bonds now dwarf\nthe amount of funds that is exchanged as a result of the transactions in goods and\nservices for import and export purposes. The asset market theory is basically the\nopposite of the balance of payments theory since it takes into account a nation’s\ncapital account instead of its current account.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?49A Dollar-Driven Theory\nThroughout 1999, many experts argued that the dollar would fall against the euro\non the grounds of the expanding U.S. current account deﬁcit and an overvalued\nWall Street. That was based on the rationale that non-U.S. investors would begin\nwithdrawing their funds from U.S. stocks and bonds into more economically sound\nmarkets, which would weigh signiﬁcantly on the dollar. Yet, such fears have lingered\nsince the early 1980s when the U.S. current account soared to a record high 3.5%\nof GDP.\nIn the two decades that followed, the balance of payments approach in assessing\nthe dollar’s behavior has given way to the asset market approach. This theory\ncontinues to hold the most sway over pundits due to the enormity of U.S. capital\nmarkets. In May and June of 2002, the dollar plummeted over 1000 points versus\nthe yen at the same time equity investors ﬂed U.S. equity markets due to the\naccounting scandals that were plaguing Wall Street. As the scandals subsided toward\nthe end of 2002, the dollar rose 500 points from a low of 115.43 to close at 120.00\nagainst the yen, even though the current account balance remained in massive deﬁcit\nthe entire time.\nLimitations to the Asset Market Theory\nIt is frequently argued that over the long run, there is no relationship between\na nation’s equity market performance and the performance of its currency. See\nFigure 3.7 for a comparison. Between April 2014 and April 2015, the German DAX\nand EURUSD have a very weak correlation.\nAlso, what happens to a nation’s currency when the stock market is trading\nsideways—stuck between bullish and bearish sentiments? That was the scenario in\n6/11/14 7/11/14 8/11/14 9/11/1410/11/14 11/11/14 12/11/141/11/15 2/11/15 3/11/15 4/11/15 5/11/15 6/11/15EURUSD and DAX\n13000\n12500\n12000\n11500\n11000\n10500\n10000\n9500\n9000\n80001.4\n1.35\n1.3\n1.2\n11.051.11.151.25\n8500\nEURUSD BGN Curncy (R1) DAX  INDEX (R2)\nFIGURE 3.7 The DAX Index and the EURUSD\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?50Germany for much of 2014, and currency traders found themselves going back to\nolder money making models, such as interest rate arbitrage, as a result. Only time\nwill tell whether the asset market model will hold up or merely be a short-term blip\non the currency forecasting radar.\nThe Currency Substitution Model\nThe currency substitution model is an enhanced version of the monetary model\nbecause it takes into account investor ﬂows. It posits that the shifting of private\nand public portfolios from one nation to another can have a signiﬁcant effect on\nexchange rates. The ability of individuals to change their assets from domestic and\nforeign currencies is known as currency substitution. When this model is added\nto the monetary model, evidence shows that shifts in expectations of a nation’s\nmoney supply can have a decided impact on that nation’s exchange rates. Simply\nput, investors are looking at monetary model data and coming to the conclusion\nthat a change in money ﬂow is about to occur, thus affecting the exchange rate, so\nthey are investing accordingly, which turns the monetary model into a self-fulﬁlling\nprophecy. Investors who subscribe to this theory are merely jumping on the currency\nsubstitution model bandwagon on the way to the monetary model party.\nThe Yen Example\nIn the monetary model we talked about how the Japanese government was basically\nprinting yen and increasing the money supply when it bought stocks and bonds.\nMonetary model theorists would say that this monetary growth would spark inﬂation\n(more yen chasing fewer products), decrease demand for the yen, and ﬁnally cause\nthe yen to depreciate. A currency substitution theorist would agree with this scenario\nand look to take advantage of this view by shorting the yen, or if they were long\nthe yen promptly getting out of the position. By taking this action, our yen trader\nis helping to drive the market precisely in that direction, thus making the monetary\nmodel theory a fate accompli. The step-by-step process is illustrated in Figure 3.8.\nA. Japan announces new stock and bond buyback plan. Economists are now\npredicting Japan’s money supply will dramatically increase.\nB. Economists are also predicting a rise in inﬂation with the introduction of this\nnew policy. Speculators expect a change in the exchange rate as a result.\nC. Economists expect interest rates to rise and inﬂation takes hold in the economy.\nSpeculators start selling short the yen in anticipation of a change in the exchange\nrate.\nD. Demand for the yen plummets as money ﬂows easily through the Japanese\neconomy and speculators dump yen in the markets.\nE. The exchange rate for the Japanese yen changes dramatically as the yen falls\nin value to foreign currencies, especially those that are easily substituted by\ninvestors (read: liquid yen crosses).\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?51Forecast of\nFuture\nMonetary\nGrowth Forecast of\nFuture InflationChange in\nExchange RateChange in Real\nMoney Demand\nChange in\nExpected\nExchange RateChange in\nDemand for\nForeign Cash\nAB CD EForecast of\nFuture Inflation\nFIGURE 3.8 Currency Substitution Model\nLimitations of the Currency Substitution Model\nAmong the major, actively traded currencies, this model has not yet shown itself\nto be a convincing, single determinant for exchange rate movements. While this\ntheory can be used with more conﬁdence in underdeveloped countries where ‘‘hot\nmoney’’ rushes in and out of emerging markets with enormous effect, there are\nstill too many variables not accounted for by the currency substitution model. For\nexample, using the yen illustration in Figure 3.8, even though Japan may try to spark\ninﬂation with its securities’ buyback plan, it still has an enormous current account\nsurplus that will continually prop up the yen. Also, Japan has numerous political\nlandmines it must avoid in its own neighborhood, and should Japan make it clear\nthat it is trying to devalue its currency, there will be enormous repercussions. These\nare just two of many factors the substitution model does not take into consideration.\nHowever, this model (like numerous other currency models) should be considered\npart of an overall, balanced, FX forecasting diet.",

Traditionally, it is the platform through which governments, businesses,\ninvestors, travelers, and other interested parties convert or ‘‘exchange’’ currency.\nAt its most fundamental level, the foreign exchange market is an over-the-counter\n(OTC) market with no central exchange and clearing house where orders are\nmatched. FX dealers and market makers around the world are linked to each other\naround-the-clock via telephone, computer, and fax, creating one cohesive market.\nThrough the years, this has changed with many institutions offering exchange traded\nFX instruments, but all of the prices are still derived from the underlying or spot\nforex market.\nIn the past two decades, foreign exchange, also known as forex orFX,became\navailable to trade by individual retail investors, and this access caused the market\nto explode in popularity. In the early 2000s, the Bank of International Settlements\nreported a 57% increase in volume between Ap ril 2001 and 2004. At the time more\nthan $1.9 trillion were changing hands on a daily basis. After the ﬁnancial crisis in\n2008, the pace of growth eased to a still- respectable 32% between 2010 and 2013,\nbut the actual volume that changed hands was signiﬁcantly larger at an average of\n$5.3 trillion per day. To put this into perspective, it is 50 times greater than the\ndaily trading volume of the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ combined.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET2While the growth of the retail foreign exchange market contributed to this surge\nin volume, an increase in volatility over the past few years also made investors\nmore aware of how currency movements can impact the equity and bond markets.\nIf stocks, bonds, and commodity traders want to make more educated trading\ndecisions, it is important for them to also follow forex movements. What follows\nare some of the examples of how currency ﬂuctuations impacted stock and bond\nmarket movements in past years.\n■EURUSD and Corporate Proﬁtability\nFor stock market traders, particularly those who invest in European corporations that\nexport a tremendous amount of goods to the United States, monitoring exchange\nrates are essential to predicting earnings and corporate proﬁtability. Throughout 2003\nand 2004, European manufacturers complained extensively about the rapid rise in the\neuro and the weakness in the U.S. dollar. The main culprit for the dollar’s selloff at\nthe time was the country’s rapidly growing trade and budget deﬁcits. This caused the\nEURUSD exchange rate to surge, which took a signiﬁcant toll on the proﬁtability of\nEuropean corporations because a higher exchange rate makes the goods of European\nexporters more expensive to U.S. consumers. In 2003, inadequate hedging shaved\napproximately EUR$1 billion euros from Volkswagen’s proﬁts, while DSM, a Dutch\nchemicals group, warned that a 1% move in the EURUSD rate would reduce proﬁts\nby EUR$7 million to EUR$11 million. Unfortunately, inadequate hedging is still a\nreality in Europe, which makes monitoring the EURUSD exchange rate even more\nimportant in forecasting the earnings and proﬁtability of European exporters.\n■Nikkei and U.S. Dollar\nTraders exposed to Japanese equities also need to be aware of the developments\nthat are occurring in the U.S. dollar and ho w that affects the Nikkei rally. Japan\nrecently came out of 10 years of stagnation. During this time, mutual funds and\nhedge funds were grossly underweight Japanese equities. When the economy began\nto turn around, global macro funds rushed to make changes to their portfolios in fear\nof missing out on a great opportunity to take advantage of Japan’s recovery. Hedge\nfunds borrowed signiﬁcant amount of dollars to pay for increased exposure, but the\nproblem was that their borrowings were very sensitive to U.S. interest rates and the\nFed’s monetary policy tightening cycle. Increased borrowing costs forthe dollar could\nderail the Nikkei’s rally because higher rates will raise the dollar’s ﬁnancing costs. Yet\nwith the huge current account deﬁcit, the Fed might need to continue raising rates\nto increase the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Therefore, continual\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET3rate hikes, coupled with slowing growth in Japan, may make it less proﬁtable for\nfunds to be overleveraged and overly exposed to Japanese stocks. As a result, how\nthe U.S. dollar moves also plays a role on the future direction of the Nikkei.\n■George Soros\nKnown as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England,’’ George Soros is one of\nthe most well-known traders in the FX market. We discuss his adventures in\nmore detail in Chapter 2, but in a nutshell, in 1990, England decided to join\nthe Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) system because it wanted to take part in\nthe stable and low-inﬂation environment created by the Bundesbank, the central\nbank of Germany. This alliance tied the pound to the deutschmark, which meant\nthat the United Kingdom was subject to the monetary policies enforced by the\nBundesbank. In the early 1990s, Germany aggressively increased interest rates to\navoid the inﬂationary effects related to German reuniﬁcation. However, national\npride and the commitment of ﬁxing exchange rates within the ERM prevented\nEngland from devaluing the pound. On Wednesday, September 16, also known as\nBlack Wednesday, George Soros leveraged the entire value of his fund ($1 billion) and\nsold $10 billion worth of pounds to bet against the ERM. This essentially ‘‘broke’’\nthe Bank of England and forced it to devalue the pound. In a matter of 24 hours, the\nBritish pound fell approximately 5%, or 5000 pips. The Bank of England promised\nto raise rates in order to tempt speculators to buy pounds. As a result, this caused\ntremendous volatility in the bond markets, with 1-month UK LIBOR rates rising\n1% and then retracing those gains over the next 24 hours. If bond traders were\ncompleted oblivious to what was going on in the currency markets, they would have\nprobably found themselves dumbstruck in face of such rapid gyration in yields.\n■Chinese Yuan Revaluation and Bonds\nFor Treasury traders, there’s another currency-related issue that is important to\nfollow and that is the gradual revaluation of the Chinese yuan. For most of its history,\nthe yuan or renminbi (RMB) was pegged to the U.S. dollar. In the 1980s, the RMB\nwas devalued to promote growth in C hina’s economy, and between 1997 and 2005\nthe People’s Bank of China artiﬁcially maintained a USDRMB rate of 8.27. At the\ntime, it received signiﬁcant criticism because keeping the peg meant that the Chinese\ngovernment would artiﬁcially weaken its currency to make Chinese goods more\ncompetitive. To maintain the band, the Chinese government had to sell the yuan and\nbuy U.S. dollars each time their currency appreciated above the band’s upper limit.\nThese dollars were then used to purchase U.S. Treasuries, and this practice turned\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET4China into the world’s largest holder of U.S. Treasuries. In 2005, however, China\nended its dollar peg and linked the value of the yuan to a basket of currencies and\nallowed it to ﬂuctuate within a narrow band that was reset every day. While the exact\npercentage of the basket is unknown, it is largely dominated by the U.S. dollar and\nincludes other currencies such as the euro, Japanese yen, South Korean won, British\npound, Thai baht, Russian ruble, and Australian, Canadian, and Singapore dollar.\nThrough the years China has gradually widened the band that the yuan can trade\nin, but if China were to end the ﬂoat and allow the RMB to trade freely on the\nglobal foreign exchange market, the impact on the ﬁxed-income markets would be\nsigniﬁcant because it would reduce the government’s need to purchase Treasuries\nand other ﬁxed-income securities. An announcement of this sort would send yields\nsoaring and prices tumbling. While it could be years before this happens, it will be\nimportant for bond investors to follow these developments if they want to effectively\nmanage the risk.\n■Comparing the FX Market with Futures\nand Equities\nThe foreign exchange market has not always been a popular market to trade because\nfor many decades, it was restricted to hedge funds, commodity trading advisers who\nmanage large amounts of capital, major corporations, and institutional investors\ndue to regulation, capital requirements, and technology. Yet it was the market\nof choice for many of these large players because the risk was fully customizable.\nTrader A could use a 50 times leverage, and Trader B could trade cash on cash.\nWhen the market opened up to retail traders, many brokerage ﬁrms swept in to\nprovide leveraged trading along with free instantaneous execution platforms, charts,\nand real-time news. This access to low-cost information helped foreign exchange\ntrading surge in popularity, increasing its attractiveness as an alternative asset class\nto trade.\nMany equity and futures traders also turned to currencies, adding the asset class\nto their trading portfolios. Before you choose to do so, however, it is important to\nunderstand some of the key difference s between the forex and equity markets.\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs, and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET5Characteristics of Equities Market\n1. There is decent market liquidity, but that can depend on a stock’s daily volume.\n2. The market is only available for trading 9:30am to 5pm NY Time, with limited\nafter-hours trading.\n3. The existence of exchange fees results in higher costs and commissions.\n4. There is an uptick rule to short stocks, which many day traders ﬁnd frustrating.\n5. The number of steps involved in completing a trade can increase slippage and\nerror.\nAs one of the most liquid markets in the world, the volume and liquidity present in\nthe FX markets has allowed traders to access a 24-hour market with low transaction\ncosts, high leverage, the ability to proﬁt in both bull and bear markets, minimized\nerror rates, limited slippage, and no trading curbs or uptick rules. Oftentimes, traders\ncan use the same strategies for analyzing the equity markets in the FX market. Funda-\nmental traders will ﬁnd that countries can be analyzed like stocks. Technical traders\nwill ﬁnd that the FX market is perfect for their style of analysis because of the abun-\ndance of tick data and because it is already one of the most commonly used analysis\ntools by professional traders. Now let’s take a closer look at the individual attributes\nof the FX market to really understand why this is such an attractive market to trade!\n24-Hour Market\nOne of the primary reasons why the FX market is popular is because for active\ntraders, it is the ideal market to trade. It’s 24-hour nature offers traders instant access\nto the markets at all hours of the day for immediate response to global developments.\nThis characteristic also gives traders the added ﬂexibility of determining their own\ntrading day. Active day traders no longer have to wait for the equities market to\nopen at 9:30am NY Time to begin trading. If there is a signiﬁcant announcement or\ndevelopment either domest ically or overseas bet ween 4pm NY Time and 9:30am\nNY Time, most day traders will have to wait for the exchanges to open at 9:30am\nto place trades. In all likelihood, by that time, unless you have access to electronic\ncommunication networks (ECNs) such as Instinet for premarket trading, the market\nwould have gapped up or gapped down against your favor. This is particularly\nfrustrating when important data are released at 8:30am NY Time, such as nonfarm\npayrolls. Professionals would have already priced in the outcome before the average\ntrader can even access to market.\nIn addition, many people who want to trade also have a full-time job during\nthe day. The ability to trade after hours makes the FX market a much more\nconvenient market for all traders. Different times of the day will offer different\ntrading opportunities, as the global ﬁnancial centers around the world are all actively\ninvolved in foreign exchange. With the FX m arket, trading after hours with a large\nonline FX broker provides the same liquidity and spread as any other time of day.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET6As a guideline, at 5pm Sunday NY Time, trading begins as the markets open in\nSydney, Australia. Then, the Tokyo markets open at 7 pm NY Time. Next, Singapore\nand Hong Kong open at 9pm NY Time followed by the European markets in Frankfurt\n(2am) and then London (3am). By 4am the European markets are in full swing, and\nAsia has concluded their trading day. The U.S. markets open ﬁrst in New York around\n8am Monday as Europe winds down. By 5pm, Sydney is set to reopen once again.\nThe majority of trading activity happens when the markets overlap; for example,\nAsia and Europe trading overlaps between 12am to approximately 2am, Europe and\nthe United States overlaps between 8a m to approximately 12pm NY Time, while\nthe United States and Asia overlap be tween 5pm and 9pm. During New York and\nLondon hours, all currency pairs trade actively. During the Asian hours, however,\nthe trading activity for pairs such as the GBPJPY and AUDJPY tend to peak.\nLower Transaction Costs\nLower transaction costs also makes forex an attractive asset class to trade. In the\nequity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission and with online\nequity brokers, commissions can run upwards of $20 per trade. This means that for\npositions of $100,000, average roundtrip commissions could be as high as $120.\nThe over the counter (OTC) structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which, in turn, lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Equity traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade for\nshort-term traders. For an active equity trader who typically places 30 trades a day,\nat $20 commission per trade, you would have to up to pay $600 in daily transaction\ncosts. This is a signiﬁcant amount of money that could take a large cut out of proﬁts\nor deepen losses. The reason why costs are so high is because there are a lot of\npeople involved in an equity transaction. More speciﬁcally, for each trade, there is\na broker, the exchange, and the specialist. All of these parties need to be paid, and\ntheir payment comes in the form of commission and clearing fees. In the FX market,\nbecause it is decentralized with no exchange or clearinghouse (everything is taken\ncare of by the market maker), these fees are not applicable.\nCustomizable Leverage\nEven though many people realize that higher leverage comes with risks, traders are\nhumans, and few of them ﬁnd it easy to turn away the opportunity to trade on\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET7someone else’s money. The FX market caters perfectly to these traders by offering\nthe highest leverage available for any market. Most online currency ﬁrms offer 50\ntimes leverage on regular-sized accounts and up to 200 times leverage on miniature\naccounts (abroad leverage can be as high as 400 times). Compare that to the 2 times\nleverage offered to the average equity investor and the 10 times capital that is\ntypically offered to the professional trader, and you can see why many traders have\nturned to the foreign exchange market. The margin deposit for leverage in the FX\nmarket is not seen as a down payment on a purchase of equity, as many perceive\nmargins to be in the stock markets. Rather, the margin is a performance bond, or\ngood-faith deposit, to ensure against trading losses. This is very useful to short-term\nday traders who need the enhancement in capital to generate quick returns. For the\nmore risk-averse investor, leverage is completely customizable, which means that\nif they only feel comfortable with 10 or 20 times leverage or no leverage at all,\nthey can elect to do so. It is extremely important to understand that leverage is a\ndouble-edged sword—it can magnify proﬁts but also losses.\nProﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nIn the FX market, proﬁt potentials exist in both bull and bear markets. Since\ncurrency trading always involves buying one currency and selling another, there\nis no structural bias to the market. Therefore, if you are long one currency, you\nare at the same time short another. As a result, equal proﬁt potential exists in\nboth upward-trending and downward-trending markets. This is different from the\nequities market, where most traders go long instead of short stocks, so the general\nequity investment community tends to suffer in a bear market.\nNo Trading Curbs or Uptick Rule\nThe FX market is the largest market in the world, forcing market makers to offer\nvery competitive prices. Unlike the equities market, there is never a time in the\nFX markets when trading curbs would take into effect and trading would be halted,\nonly to gap when reopened. This eliminates missed proﬁts due to archaic exchange\nregulations. In the FX market, traders would be able to place trades 24 hours a day\nwith virtually no disruptions.\nOne of the biggest annoyances for day trades in the equity market is the fact\nthat traders are prohibited from shorting a stock in a downtrend unless there is an\nuptick. This can be very frustrating as traders wait to join short sellers, but are only\nleft with continually watching the stock trend down before an uptick occurs. In the\nFX market, there is no such rule. If you want to short a currency pair, you can do\nso immediately; this allows for instant and efﬁcient execution.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET8Online Trading Reducing Error Rates\nA shorter trade process minimizes errors. Online currency trading is typically a\nthree-step process. A trader would place an order on the platform, the FX dealing\ndesk would automatically execute it electronically, and the order conﬁrmation\nwould be posted or logged onto the trader’s trading station. Typically, these three\nsteps would be completed in a matter of seconds. For an equities trade on the other\nhand, there is generally a ﬁve-step process. The client would call his broker to place\nan order, the broker sends the order to the exchange ﬂoor, the specialist on the\nﬂoor tries to match up orders (the broker competes with other brokers to get the\nbest ﬁll for the client), the specialist executes the trade, and the client receives a\nconﬁrmation from the broker. The elimination of a middleman minimizes the error\nrates in currency trades and increases the efﬁciency of each transaction.\nLimited Slippage\nUnlike the equity markets, many online FX market makers provide instantaneous\nexecution from real-time, two-way quotes. These quotes are the prices where the\nﬁrms are willing to buy or sell the quoted currency, rather than vague indications\nof where the market is trading, which may or may not be honored. Orders are\nexecuted and conﬁrmed within seconds. Robust systems would never request the\nsize of a trader’s potential order, or which side of the market he’s trading, before\ngiving him a bid/offer quote. Inefﬁcient dealers determine whether the investor is a\nbuyer or a seller, and shade the price to increase their own proﬁt on the transaction.\nThe equity market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’ system, under\nwhich you may not get executed at the price you wish, but rather at the next best\nprice available. For example, let’s say Microsoft is trading at $52.50. If you enter a\nbuy order at this rate, by the time it reaches the specialist on the exchange ﬂoor, the\nprice may have risen to $53.25. In this case, you will not get executed at $52.50;\nyou will get executed at $53.25, which is essentially a loss of 3∕4of a point. The\nprice transparency provided by the some of the better market makers assures that\ntraders always receive a fair price.\nPerfect Market for Technical Analysis\nFor technical analysts, currencies rarely spend much time in tight trading ranges and\nhave the tendency to develop strong trends. Over 80% of volume is speculative in\nnature and as a result, the market frequently overshoots and then corrects itself.\nHence, technical analysis works well for the FX market, and a technically trained\ntrader can easily identify new trends and breakouts, which provide multiple oppor-\ntunities to enter and exit positions. Charts and indicators are used by all professional\nFX market traders, and candle charts are available on most charting packages. In addi-\ntion, the most commonly used indicators such as Fibonacci retracements, stochastics,\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET9MACD, moving averages, RSI, and support/resistance levels have proven valid in\nmany instances.\nIn the USDJPY chart shown in Figure 1.1, it is clear that Fibonacci retracements,\nmoving averages, and stochastics have at one point or another given successful\ntrading signals. For example, the 61.8% retracement level served as resistance for\nUSDJPY in December 2014, January 2015, and February 2015. The moving-average\ncrossovers of the 10- and 20-day simple moving averages also successfully forecasted\nthe rally in USDJPY in late October, along with the decline in early January. Equity\ntraders who focus on technical analysis have the easiest transition, since they can\nimplement the same technical strategies that they use in the equities market into the\nFX market.\nAnalyze Stocks Like Countries\nTrading currencies is not a big challenge for fundamental traders either, because\ncountries can be analyzed like stocks. For example, if you analyze growth rates of\nstocks, you can use gross domestic product (GDP) to analyze the growth rate of\ncountries. If you analyze inventory and production ratios, you can follow industrial\nproduction (IP) or durable goods data. If you follow sales ﬁgures, you can analyze\nretail sales data. As with a stock investme n t ,i ti sb e t t e rt oi n v e s ti nt h ec u r r e n c yo fa\ncountry that is growing faster and fund it with a currency of a country that is growing\nslower. Currency prices reﬂect the balance of supply and demand for currencies.\nTwo of the primary factors affecting supply and demand of currencies are interest\nrates and the overall strength of the economy. Economic indicators such as GDP,\nforeign investment, and the trade balance reﬂect the general health of an economy\nand are therefore responsible for the underlying shifts in supply and demand for\nthat currency. There is a tremendous amount of data released at regular intervals,\nsome of which are more important than others. Data related to interest rates and\ninternational trade is the most closely followed.\nIf there is uncertainty regarding the direction of interest rates, any bit of news\non monetary policy can directly affect how the currency trades. Traditionally,\nif a country raises its interest rate, the currency of that country will strengthen\nin relation to other countries as investors shift assets to that country to gain a\nhigher return. In contrast, an interest rates hike is generally bad news for stocks\nbecause it means that borrowing costs have risen. In response, some investors will\ntransfer money out of a country’s stock market when interest rates are increased,\ncausing the country’s currency to weaken. Determining which effect dominates can\nbe tricky, but generally there is an advance consensus on how interest rates will\nmove. Indicators that have the biggest impact on interest rates are producer prices,\nconsumer prices, employment, spending, and GDP. Most of the time monetary\npolicy announcements are known in advance with meeting dates by the Bank of\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET10\nFIGURE 1.1 USDJPY Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET11England (BoE), the Federal Reserve (FED), European Central Bank (ECB), Bank\nof Japan (BoJ), and other central banks posted on their respective websites.\nAnother piece of data that can impact how currencies move is the trade balance,\nwhich shows the net differ ence over a period of time b etween a nation’s exports and\nimports. When a country imports more than it exports, the trade balance will show\na deﬁcit, which is generally considered unfavorable. For example, if U.S. dollars are\nsold for other domestic national currencies (to pay for imports), the ﬂow of dollars\noutside the country will depreciate the value of the dollar. Similarly, if trade ﬁgures\nshow an increase in exports, dollars will ﬂow into the United States and appreciate\nthe value of the dollar. From the standpoint of a national economy, a deﬁcit in and of\nitself is not necessarily a bad thing. If the deﬁcit is greater than market expectations\nhowever, it can trigger a negative price movement.\n■FX versus Futures\nTrading spot forex is also different from trading futures, and like equity traders,\nmany futures traders have also added currency spot trading into their portfolios. We\nknow that the spot forex market has the following attributes:\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nCharacteristics of Futures Markets\n1. There is limited market liquidity depending on the month of contract trades.\n2. The presence of exchange fees results in more costs and commissions.\n3. Market hours for futures trading are much shorter than spot and are dependent\non the product traded; each product may have different open and closing hours,\nand there is limited after-hours trading.\n4. Futures leverage is higher than equities, but still only a fraction of the leverage\noffered in FX.\n5. There tends to be prolonged bear markets.\n6. Pit trading structure increases error and slippage.\nLike in the equities market, traders can implement the same strategies they use\nin analyzing the futures markets in the FX m arket. Most future tr aders are technical\ntraders, and the FX market is perfect for technical analysis. In fact, it is the most\npopular analysis technique used by professional FX traders. Taking a closer look at\nhow the futures market stacks up, we see the following.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET12Comparing Market Hours and Liquidity\nThe volume traded in the FX market is estimated to be over ﬁve times that of the\nfutures market. The FX market is open for trading 24 hours a day, but the futures\nmarket has confusing market hours which vary based on the product traded. For\nexample, if you traded gold futures, it is only open for trading between 7:20am\nand 1:30pm on the COMEX. If you traded crude oil futures on the New York\nMercantile Exchange, t rading would only be ope n between 8:30am. and 2:10pm.\nThese varying hours not only create confusion but also makes it difﬁcult to act on\nbreakthrough announcements throughout the reminder of the day.\nIn addition, if you have a day job and can only trade after hours, futures would be\na very inconvenient market product to trade. You would basically be placing orders\nbased on past prices that are not current market prices. This lack of transparency\nmakes trading very cumbersome. In addition, each time zone has its own unique\nnews and developments that could move speciﬁc currency pairs, and with futures it\ncan difﬁcult to act on breaking overnight news.\nLow to Zero Transaction Costs\nIn the equity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission. With future\nbrokers, average commissions can run close to $160 per trade on positions of\n$100,000 or greater. The OTC structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which can in turn lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight,\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Futures traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow to zero transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade\nfor short-term traders. If you are an active futures trader who typically places 20\ntrades a day, at $100 commission per trade, you would have to pay $2,000 in daily\ntransaction costs. A typical futures trade involves a broker, a future commissions\nmerchant (FCM) order desk, a clerk on the exchange ﬂoor, a runner, and a pit\ntrader. All of these parties need to be paid, and their payment comes in the form of\ncommission and clearing fees, whereas the electronic nature of the market minimizes\nthese costs.\nNo Limit Up or Down Rules/Proﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nUnlike the tight restriction on the futures market, there is no limit down or limit\nup rule in the FX market. For example, on the S&P index futures, if the contract\nvalue falls more than 5% from the previous day’s close, limit down rules will come\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET13in effect, whereby on a 5% move, the index would only be allowed to trade at\nor above this level for the next 10 minutes. For a 20% decline, trading would be\ncompletely halted. Due to the decentralized nature of the FX market, there are no\nexchange-enforced restrictions on daily activity, which can help eliminate missed\nopportunities caused by archaic exchange regulations.\nExecution Quality and Speed/Low Error Rates\nThe futures market is also known for inconsistent execution, both in terms of pricing\nand execution time. Every futures trader has, at some point in time, experienced\na half hour or so wait for a market order to be ﬁlled, only to ﬁnd that the order\nhas been executed at a price far away from where the market was trading when\nthe initial order was placed. Even with electronic trading and limited guarantees of\nexecution speed, the price for ﬁlls on market orders is far from certain. The reason\nfor this inefﬁciency is the number of steps that are involved in placing a futures\ntrade. A futures trade is typically a seven-step process:\n1. The client calls his broker and places his trade (or places it online).\n2. The trading desk receives the order, processes it, and routes it to the FCM\norder desk on the exchange ﬂoor.\n3. The FCM order desk passes the order to the order clerk.\n4. The order clerk hands the order to a runner or signals it to the pit.\n5. The trading clerk goes to the pit to execute the trade.\n6. The trade conﬁrmation goes to the runner or is signaled to the order clerk and\nprocessed by the FCM order desk.\n7. The broker receives the trade conﬁrmation and passes it on to the client.\nAn FX trade in comparison is typically only a three-step process. A trader would\nplace an order on the platform, the FX dealing desk would automatically execute\nit electronically, and the order conﬁrmation would be posted or logged on the\ntrader’s trading station. The elimination of the involvement of these additional\nparties increases the speed of the trade execution and decreases errors.\nIn addition, the futures market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’\nsystem, under which your trades frequently do not get executed at the initial market\norder price, but rather, at the next best price available. For example, let’s say a\nclient is long 5 March Dow Jones futures contracts at 8800. If the client enters a\nstop order at 8700, when the rate reaches this level, the client will most likely be\nexecuted at 8690. This 10-point difference would be attributed to slippage, which\nis very common in the futures market.\nOn most FX trading stations, traders execute directly off of real-time streaming\nprices. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, there is generally no discrepancy\nbetween the displayed price and the execution price. This holds true even during\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET14volatile times and fast-moving markets. In the futures market, execution is uncertain\nbecause all orders must be done on the exchange. This creates a situation where\nliquidity is limited by the number of participants, which, in turn, limits quantities\nthat can be traded at a given price. Real-time streaming prices ensure that market\norders, stops, and limits are executed with minimal slippage and no partial ﬁlls.\n■W h oA r et h eP l a y e r si nt h eF XM a r k e t ?\nSince the foreign exchange market is an OTC market without a centralized exchange,\ncompetition between market makers prohibits monopolisti c pricing strategies. If\none market maker attempts to drastically skew the price, then traders simply have\nthe option to ﬁnd another market maker. Moreover, spreads are closely watched to\nensure market makers are not whimsically altering the cost of the trade. Many equity\nmarkets, on the other hand, operate in a completely different fashion; the New York\nStock Exchange, for instance, is the sole place where companies listed on the NYSE\ncan have their stocks traded. Centralized markets are operated by what are referred\nto as specialists. Market makers, on the other hand, is the term used in reference to\ndecentralized marketplaces. Since the NYSE is a centralized market, a stock traded\non the NYSE can only have one bid–ask quote at all times. Decentralized markets,\nsuch as foreign exchange, can have multiple market makers—all of whom have the\nright to quote different prices. Here is an illustration of how both centralized and\ndecentralized markets operate.\nCentralized Markets\nBy their very nature, centralized markets tend to be monopolistic: With a single\nspecialist controlling th e market, prices can easil y be skewed to a ccommodate the\ninterests of the specialist, not those of the traders (see Figure 1.2). If, for example,\nthe market is ﬁlled with sellers that the specialists must buy from but no prospective\nbuyers on the other side, the specialist may simply widen the spread, thereby\nBuyers\nCan buy only\nfrom one\nspecialistSpecialist\nUnites buyers and\nsellers; maintains\nsole control over\nthe spreadSellers\nCan sell only to\none specialist\nFIGURE 1.2 Centralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET15increasing the cost of the trade and preventing additional participants from entering\nthe market. Or, specialists can drastically alter the quotes they are offering, thus\nmanipulating the price to accommodate their own risk tolerance.\nHierarchy of Participants\nWhile the foreign exchange market is decentralized, and hence employs multiple\nmarket makers rather than a single specialist, participants in the FX market are\norganized into a hierarchy; those with superior credit access, volume transacted,\nand sophistication receive priority pricing in the market (see Figure 1.3). At the\ntop of the food chain is the interbank market, which trades the highest volume per\nday in relatively few currencies. In the interbank market, the largest banks can deal\nwith each other directly, via interbank brokers, or through electronic brokering\nsystems like EBS or Reuters. The interbank market is a credit-approved system,\nwhere banks trade based solely on the credit relationships they have established\nwith one another. The banks can see the rates everyone is dealing at, but each bank\nmust have a speciﬁc credit relationship with that bank in order to trade at the rates\nbeing offered. Other institutions such as online FX market makers, hedge funds,\nand corporations must trade FX through these banks, although some have created\ntheir own liquidity pools through the years. Many banks (e.g., small community\nbanks or banks in emerging markets), corporations, and institutional investors do\nnot have access to these rates because they have no established credit lines with\nbig banks. This forces smaller participants to deal through just one bank for their\nRetail Clients\nTrader\nTrader\nTrader\nTraderOnline TradingInterbank Market\nBank Bank\nBank BankEBS and\nReutersOnline FX\nMarket\nMakers\nFIGURE 1.3 Decentralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET16foreign exchange needs, and oftentimes this means much less competitive rates for\nthe participants further down the participant hierarchy. Those receiving the least\ncompetitive rates are customers of banks and physical currency exchange companies.\nRecently, technology has broken down the barriers that used to stand between the\nend-users of foreign exchange services and the interbank market. The online trading\nrevolution opened its doors to retail clientele by connecting market makers and\nmarket participants in an efﬁcient, low-cost manner. In essence, online trading\nplatforms serve as a gateway to the liquid FX market. Average traders can now\ntrade alongside the biggest banks in the world, with virtually similar pricing and\nexecution. What used to be a game dominated and controlled by the ‘‘big boys’’ is\nslowly becoming a level playing ﬁeld where individuals can proﬁt and take advantage\nof the same opportunities as big banks. FX is no longer an old boys club, which\nmeans opportunities abound for aspiring online currency traders.\nDealing Stations— Interbank Market\nFor serious traders who want to know more about the interbank market, the\nmajority of FX volume is actually transacted primarily through the interbank\nmarket. The leading banks of the world trade with each other electronically\nover two platforms—the EBS and Reuters, dealing 3000-spot matching. Both\nplatforms offer trading in the major currency pairs; however, certain currency\npairs are more liquid and generally more frequently traded over one versus the\nother. Some cross-currency pairs are traded over these platforms as well, but\nothers are calculated from the rates of the major currency pairs and are then offset\nusing the ‘‘legs.’’ For example, if an interbank trader had a client who wanted to\ngo long NZDCAD, the trader would most likely buy NZDUSD and USDCAD\nseparately. The trader would then multiply these rates and provide the client with\nthe respective NZDCAD rate, creating a synthetic quote and trade.\n17CHAPTER 2\nHistorical Events in\nthe FX Markets\nBefore learning how to trade currencies, it is important for every new and\nseasoned market participant to have some understanding about the most\nimportant historical events that have shaped the currency market. To this day, these\nevents are often referenced by professional traders.\n■Bretton Woods: Anointing the Dollar as the World\nCurrency (1944)\nIn July 1944, representatives of 44 nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire,\nto create a new institutional arrangement for governing the international economy\nin the years following World War II. Most agreed that international economic\ninstability was one of the principle causes of the war, and that such instability needed\nto be prevented in the future. The agreement, which was developed by renowned\neconomists John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White, was initially proposed\nto Great Britain as a part of the Lend Lease Act—an American act designed to assist\nGreat Britain in postwar redevelopment efforts. After various negotiations, the ﬁnal\nform of the Bretton Woods Agreement consisted of three key items:\n1. The formation of key international authorities designed to promote fair trade\nand international economic harmony\n2. The ﬁxation of exchange rates between currencies\n3. The convertibility between gold and t he U.S. dollar, thus empowering the U.S.\ndollar as the reserve currency of choice for the world\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS18Of these three parameters, only the ﬁrst is still in existence today, but the\norganizations formed as a direct result of Bretton Woods include the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT); and they all play a crucial role in modern day development and regulation\nof international economies. Since the demise of Bretton Woods, the IMF has\nworked closely with the World Bank. Toge ther, the two institutions now regularly\nlend funds to developing nations, assisting them in the development of a public\ninfrastructure capable of supporting a sound mercantile economy that can contribute\nin the international arena. In order to ensure that these nations can actually enjoy\nequal and legitimate access to trade with their industrialized counterparts, the World\nBank and IMF must work closely with GATT. While GATT was initially meant to\nbe a temporary organization, it now operates to encourage the dismantling of trade\nbarriers—namely, tariffs and quotas.\nThe Bretton Woods Agreement existed from 1944 to 1971, after which it\nwas replaced by the Smithsonian Agreement, an international contract pioneered\nby U.S. President Richard Nixon out the necessity to accommodate for Bretton\nWoods’ shortcomings. Unfortunately, the Smithsonian Agreement possessed the\nsame critical weakness: While it did not include gold/U.S. dollar convertibility,\nit maintained ﬁxed exchange rates—a facet that did not accommodate the United\nStates’ ongoing trade deﬁcit and the international need for a weaker U.S. dollar. As\na result, the Smithsonian Agreement was short-lived.\nUltimately, the exchange rates of t he world evolved into a free market,\nwhere supply and demand were the sole criteria that determined the value of a\ncurrency. While this did and still does result in a number of currency crises and\ngreater volatility between currencies, it also allowed the market to become self-\nregulating, and thus could dictate the appropriate value of a currency without any\nhindrances.\nAs for Bretton Woods, perhaps its most memorable contribution to the interna-\ntional economic arena was its role in changing the international perception about the\nU.S. dollar. While the euro is a revolutionary currency blazing new frontiers in both\nsocial behavior and international trade, the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve\ncurrency of choice. This is due, in large part, to the Bretton Woods Agreement:\nBy establishing dollar/gold convertibility, the dollar’s role as the world’s most\naccessible and reliable currency was ﬁrmly cemented. So while Bretton Woods\nmight be a doctrine of yesteryear, its impact on the U.S. dollar and international\neconomics still resonates today.\n■The End of Bretton Woods: Free Market\nCapitalism Is Born (1971)\nOn August 15, 1971, it became ofﬁcial: The Bretton-Woods system was abandoned\nonce and for all. While it had been exorcised before—only to subsequently emerge\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS19in a new form—this ﬁnal eradication of the Bretton Woods system was truly its\nlast stand: No longer would currencies be ﬁxed in value to gold, allowed only to\nﬂuctuate in a 1% range, but instead, their fair valuation could be determined by\nfree-market behavior such as trade ﬂows and foreign direct investment.\nAlthough U.S. President Nixon was conﬁdent that the end of the Bretton Woods\nsystem would bring about better times for the international economy, he was\nnot a believer that the free market could dictate a currency’s true valuation in a\nfair and catastrophe-free manner. Nixon and many well-respected economists at\nthe time reasoned that an entirely unstructured foreign exchange market would\nresult in competing devaluations, which, in turn, would lead to the breakdown of\ninternational trade and investment. The end result, Nixon and his board of economic\nadvisors argued, would be global depression.\nIn response, the Smithsonian Agreement was introduced a few months later.\nHailed by President Nixon as the ‘‘greatest monetary agreement in the history of\nthe world,’’ the Smithsonian Agreement strived to maintain ﬁxed exchange rates\nwithout the backing of gold. Its key difference from the Bretton Woods system was\nthat the value of the dollar could ﬂoat in a range of 2.25%, compared to just 1%\nunder Bretton Woods.\nUltimately, the Smithsonian Agreement proved to be unfeasible as well. Without\nexchange rates ﬁxed to gold, the free market gold price shot up to $215 per\nounce. Moreover, the U.S. trade deﬁcit continued to grow, and from a fundamental\nstandpoint, the U.S. dollar needed to be devalued beyond the 2.25% parameters\nestablished by the Smithsonian Agreement. In light of these problems, the foreign\nexchange markets were forced to close in February 1972.\nThe markets reopened in March 1973, and this time, they were not bound by a\nSmithsonian Agreement: The value of the US dollar was to be determined entirely\nby the market, as its value was not ﬁxed to any commodity, nor was its exchange rate\nﬂuctuation conﬁned to certain parameters. While this did provide the U.S. dollar,\nand other currencies by default, the agility required to adapt to a new and rapidly\nevolving international trading environment, it also set the stage for unprecedented\ninﬂation. The end of Bretton Woods and the Smithsonian Agreement, as well as\nconﬂicts in the Middle East, resulted in substantially higher oil prices and helped\nto create stagﬂation—the synthesis of unemployment and inﬂation—in the U.S.\neconomy. It would not be until later in the decade, when Federal Reserve Chairman\nPaul Volcker initiated new economic policies and President Reagan introduced a new\nﬁscal agenda, that the U.S. dollar would return to ‘‘normal’’ valuations. By then,\nthe foreign exchange markets had thoroughly developed and were capable of serving\na multitude of purposes. In addition to employing a laissez-faire style of regulation\non international trade, they also were beginning to attract speculators seeking to\nparticipate in a market with unrivaled liquidity and continued growth. Ultimately,\nthe death of Bretton Woods in 1971 marked the beginning of a new economic era, one\nthat liberated international trading while also proliferating speculative opportunities.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS20■Plaza Accord—Devaluation\nof the U.S. Dollar (1985)\nAfter the demise of all the various exchange rate regulatory mechanisms that\ncharacterized the twentieth century—t hat is, the Gold Standard, the Bretton\nWoods Standard, and the Smithsonian Agreement—the currency market was left\nwith virtually no regulation other than the mythical ‘‘invisible hand’’ of free\nmarket capitalism, one that supposedly strived to create economic balance through\nsupply and demand. Unfortunately, due to a number of unforeseen economic\nevents—such as the OPEC oil crises, stagﬂation throughout the 1970s, and drastic\nchanges in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ﬁscal policy—supply and demand, in and\nof themselves, became insufﬁcient means by which the currency markets could be\nregulated. A system of sorts was needed, but not one that was inﬂexible: Fixation of\ncurrency values to a commodity, such as gold, proved to be too rigid for economic\ndevelopment, as was also the notion of ﬁxing maximum exchange rate ﬂuctuations.\nThe balance between structure and rigidity was one that had plagued the currency\nmarkets throughout the twentieth century, and while advancements had been made,\na deﬁnitive solution was still greatly needed.\nHence, in 1985, the respective ministers of ﬁnance and central bank governors\nof the world’s leading economies—France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom,\nand the United States—convened in New York City, with the hopes of arranging a\ndiplomatic agreement that would work to optimize the economic effectiveness of\nthe foreign exchange markets. Meeting at the Plaza Hotel, the international leaders\ncame to the following agreements regarding speciﬁc economies and the international\neconomy as a whole:\n■Across the world, inﬂation was at very low levels. Contrary to the stagﬂation of\nthe 1970s—where inﬂation was high and real economic growth was low—the\nglobal economy in 1985 had done a complete 180, as inﬂation was now low and\ngrowth was strong.\n■While low inﬂation, even when coupled with robust economic growth, still\nallowed for low interest rates—a caveat that developing countries particularly\nenjoyed—there was an imminent danger of protectionist policies such as tariffs\nentering the economy. The United States was experiencing a large and growing\ncurrent account deﬁcit, while Japan and Germany were facing large and growing\nsurpluses. An imbalance so fundamental in nature could create serious economic\ndisequilibrium, which, in turn, would result in a distortion of the foreign exchange\nmarkets, and thus, the international economy as a whole.\n■The results of current account imbalances, and the protectionist policies that\nensued, required action. Ultimately, it was believed that the rapid acceleration\nin the value of the U.S. dollar, which appreciated more than 80% against the\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS21currencies of its major trading partners, was the primary culprit. The rising\nvalue of the U.S. dollar created enormous trade deﬁcits, hurting many different\neconomies.\nAt the meeting in the Plaza Hotel, the Uni ted States persuad ed other attending\ncountries to coordinate a multilateral intervention, and on September 22, 1985,\nthe Plaza Accord was implemented. This agreement was designed to allow for\na controlled decline of the dollar and the appreciation of the main anti-dollar\ncurrencies. Each country agreed to changes to their economic policies and to\nintervene in currency markets as necessary to weaken the value of the dollar. The\nUnited States agreed to cut its budget deﬁcit and lower interest rates. France, the\nUnited Kingdom, Germany, and Japan agreed to raise interest rates. Germany also\nagreed to tax cuts, while Japan agreed to let the value of the yen ‘‘fully reﬂect\nthe underlying strength of the Japanese economy.’’ However, one major problem\nwas that not every country adhered to their pledges made under the Plaza Accord.\nThe United States, in particular, did not follow through with its initial promise to\ncut the budget deﬁcit. Japan was severely hurt by the sharp rise in the yen, as its\nexporters were unable to remain competitive overseas, and it is argued that this\neventually triggered a 10-year recession in Japan. The United S tates, on the other\nhand, enjoyed considerable growth and price stability as a result of the agreement.\nThe effects of the multilateral intervention were seen immediately, and within\nless than two years, the dollar fell 46% and 50% against the German deutschemark\nand the Japanese yen, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.1.

This gradually resolved\nthe current account deﬁcits for the time being, and also ensured that protectionist\npolicies were minimal and nonthreatening. But perhaps most importantly, the\nPlaza Accord cemented the role of the central banks in regulating exchange rate\nmovement—yes, the rates would not be ﬁxed, and hence would be determined\nprimarily by supply and demand; but ultimately, such an invisible hand is insufﬁcient,\nand it was the right and responsibility of the world’s central banks to intervene on\nbehalf of the international economy when necessary.\n■George Soros—The Man Who Broke the Bank\nof England\nWhen George Soros placed a $10 billion speculative bet on the UK pound and\nwon, he became universally known as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England.’’\nWhether you love him or hate him, Soros led the charge in one of the most\nfascinating events in currency trading history. Here are the details.\nThe UK Joins the Exchange Rate Mechanism\nIn 1979, a Franco-German initiative set up the European Monetary System (EMS) to\nstabilize exchange rates, reduce inﬂation, and prepare for monetary integration. The\nExchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), one of the EMS’s main components, gave each\nparticipatory currency a central exchange rate against a basket of currencies, the\nEuropean Currency Unit (ECU). Participants (initially France, Germany, Italy, the\nNetherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and Luxemburg) were then required to\nmaintain their exchange rates within a 2.25% ﬂuctuation band above or below each\nbilateral central rate. The ERM was an adjustable-peg system, and nine realignments\nwould occur between 1979 and 1987. Whil e the United Kingdom was not one of\nthe original members, it would eventually join in 1990 at a rate of DM2.95 to the\npound and with a ﬂuctuation band of +/–6%.\nUntil mid-1992, the ERM appeared to be a success, as a disciplinary effect\nhad reduced inﬂation throughout Europe under the leadership of the German\nBundesbank. The stability wouldn’t last, however, as international investors started\nworrying that the exchange rate values of several currencies within the ERM\nwere inappropriate. Following German reuniﬁcation in 1989 government spending\nsurged, forcing the Bundesbank to print more money. This led to high inﬂation\nand left the German central bank with little choice but to increase interest rates.\nHowever, the rate hike came with consequences as it placed upward pressure on\nthe German mark. This forced other central banks to raise their interest rates as\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS23well as to maintain their pegged currency exchange rates (a direct application of\nIrving Fischer’s interest parity theory). Realizing that the UK’s weak economy and\nhigh unemployment rate would not permit the British government to maintain this\npolicy for long, George Soros stepped into action.\nSoros Bets Against the Success of UK Involvement in the ERM\nThe quantum hedge fund manager essentially wanted to bet that the pound would\ndepreciate because the United Kingdom would either devalue the pound or leave the\nERM. Thanks to the progressive removal of capital controls during the EMS years,\ninternational investors at the time had more freedom than ever to take advantage\nof perceived disequilibria, so Soros established short positions in pounds and long\npositions in marks by borrowing pounds and investing in mark-denominated assets.\nHe also made great use of options and futures. In all, his positions accounted for\na gargantuan $10 billion. Soros was not the only one; many other investors soon\nfollowed suit. Everyone was selling pounds, placing tremendous downward pressure\non the currency.\nAt ﬁrst, the Bank of England (BoE) tried to defend the pegged rates by buying\n15 billion pounds with its large reserve assets, but its sterilized interventions\n(whereby the monetary base is held constant thanks to open market interventions)\nwere limited in their effectiveness. The pound was trading dangerously close to the\nlower levels of its ﬁxed band. On September 16, 1992, a day that would later be\nknown as Black Wednesday, the bank announced a 2% rise in interest rates (from\n10% to 12%) in an attempt to boost the pound’s appeal. A few hours later, it\npromised to raise rates again to 15%, but international investors such as Soros could\nnot be swayed, knowing that huge proﬁts were right around the corner. Traders\nkept selling pounds in huge volumes, and the BoE kept buying them until, ﬁnally, at\n7:00 pm that same day, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced that Britain would\nleave the ERM and that rates would return to their initial level of 10%. The chaotic\nBlack Wednesday marked the beginning of a steep depreciation in the pound’s\neffective value.\nWhether the return to a ﬂoating currency was due to the Soros-led attack on\nthe pound or because of simple fundamental analysis is still debated today. What\nis certain, however, is that the pound’s depreciation of almost 15% against the\ndeutschemark and 25% against the dollar over the next ﬁve weeks as seen in Figure 2.2\nand Figure 2.3 resulted in tremendous proﬁts for Soros and others traders (the pound\nalso weakened by a similar proportion to the dollar). Within a month, the quantum\nfund cashed in on approximately $2 billion by selling the now more expensive\nDMs and buying back the now cheaper pounds. ‘‘The man who broke the Bank of\nEngland’’ showed how central banks can still be vulnerable to speculative attacks.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS243.00British Pound vs. Deutschemark (GBPDEM)\n2.90\n2.80\n2.70\n2.60\n2.50\n2.40\n2.30\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.2 GBPDEM after Soros\n2.10\n2.00\n1 .90\n1 .80\n1 .70\n1 .60\n1 .50\n1 .40British Pound Against US Dollar GBPUSD\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.3 GBPUSD after Soros\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS25■Asian Financial Crisis (1997–1998)\nFalling like a set of dominos on July 2, 1997, the relatively nascent Asian tiger\neconomies provide the perfect example of the interdependence in global capital\nmarkets and their subsequent effects throughout international currency forums.\nBased on several fundamental breakdowns, the cause of the ‘‘contagion’’ stemmed\nlargely from shrouded lending practices, inﬂated trade deﬁcits, and immature capital\nmarkets. Compiled, these factors contributed to a perfect storm that left major\nregional markets incapacitated and once-prized currencies devalued to signiﬁcantly\nlower levels. With adverse effects easily seen in the equities markets, currency\nmarket ﬂuctuations were negatively impacted in much the same manner during this\ntime period.\nThe Bubble\nLeading up to 1997, investors had become increasingly attracted to Asian investment\nprospects, focusing on real estate development and domestic equities. As a result,\nforeign investment capital ﬂowed into the region as economic growth rates climbed\non improved production in countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and\nKorea. Thailand, home of the baht, experienced a 6.5% growth rate in 1996, falling\nfrom 13% in 1988. Lending additional support for a stronger economy was the\nenactment of a ﬁxed currency peg to the U.S. dollar. With a ﬁxed valuation to\nthe greenback, countries like Thailand could ensure ﬁnancial stability in their own\nmarkets and a constant rate for export trading purposes with the world’s largest\neconomy. Ultimately, the region’s national currencies appreciated, as underlying\nfundamentals were justiﬁed and increased speculative positions of further climbs in\nprice mounted.\nBallooning Current Account Deﬁcits and Nonperforming Loans\nHowever, in early 1997, a shift in sentiment began to occur as international account\ndeﬁcits became increasingly difﬁcult for respective governments to handle and\nlending practices were revealed to be detrimental to the economic infrastructure. In\nparticular, economists were alerted to the fact that Thailand’s current account deﬁcit\nballooned in 1996 to $14.7 billion and had been climbing since 1992. Although\ncomparatively smaller than the U.S. deﬁcit, the gap represented 8% of the country’s\ngross domestic product. Shrouded lending practices also contributed heavily to\nthese breakdowns, as close personal relationships with high-ranking banking ofﬁcials\nwere well rewarded and surprisingly common throughout the region. In particular\nthis affected many of South Korea’s highly leveraged conglomerates as total\nnonperforming loan values skyrocketed to 7.5 percent of gross domestic product.\nAdditional evidence of these practices could be observed in ﬁnancial institutions\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS26throughout Japan. First announcing questionable and nonperforming loans of\n$136 billion in 1994, Japanese authorities admitted to an alarming $400 billion\ntotal a year later. Coupled with a then-crippled stock market, cooling real estate\nvalues, and dramatic slowdowns in the economy, investors saw opportunity in\na depreciating yen, subsequently adding selling pressure to neighbor currencies.\nWhen their own asset bubble collapsed, asset prices fell by $10 trillion, with\nthe fall in real estate prices accounting for nearly 65% of the total decline—the\nlosses were worth two years of national output. This fall in asset prices sparked\nthe banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early 1990s and then developed into a\nfull-blown, systemic crisis in 1997, following the failure of a number of high-proﬁle\nﬁnancial institutions. In response, Japanese monetary authorities issued rhetoric on\npotentially increasing benchmark interest rates in hopes of defending the domestic\ncurrency valuation. Unfortunately, these considerations never materialized and a\nshortfall ensued. Sparked mainly by an announcement of a managed ﬂoat of the Thai\nbaht, the slide snowballed as central bank reserves evaporated and currency price\nlevels became unsustainable in light of downside selling pressure.\nCurrency Crisis\nFollowing mass short speculation and attempted intervention, the aforementioned\nAsian economies were left ruined and momentarily incapacitated. The Thailand baht,\na once-prized possession, was devalued by as much as 48 percent, even slumping\ncloser to a 100% fall at the turn of the new year. The most adversely affected was\n01/01/97 02/01/97 03/01/97 04/01/97 05/01/97 06/01/97 07/01/97 08/01/97 09/01/97 10/01/97 11/01/97 12/01/97 01/01/98 02/01/98 03/01/98 04/01/9860\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0140001997–98 Asian Currency Fluctuations\n12000\n10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0Thailand Baht Indonesia Rupiah\nFIGURE 2.4 Asian Crisis Price Action\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS27150USDJPY During Asian Crisis\n145\n140\n135\n130\n125\n120\n115\n110\n105\n100\n5/3/19966/3/19967/3/19968/3/19969/3/199610/3/199611/3/199612/3/19961/3/19972/3/19973/3/19974/3/19975/3/19976/3/19977/3/19978/3/19979/3/199710/3/199711/3/199712/3/19971/3/19982/3/19983/3/19984/3/19985/3/19986/3/1998\nFIGURE 2.5 USDJPY Asian Crisis Price Action\nthe Indonesian rupiah. Also relatively stable prior to the onset of a ‘‘crawling peg’’\nwith the Thai baht, the rupiah fell a whopping 228%, worsening previously to a\nhigh of 12,950 to the ﬁxed U.S. dollar. These particularly volatile price actions are\nshown in Figure 2.4. Among the majors, the Japanese yen fell approximately 23%\nfrom its high to low against the U.S. do llar between 1997 and 1998, and after having\nretraced a signiﬁcant portion of its losses, ended the 8-month debacle down 15%,\na ss h o w ni nF i g u r e2 . 5 .\nLasting for less than a year, the ﬁnancial crisis of 1997 revealed the interconnec-\ntivity of economies and their effects in the global currency markets. Additionally, it\nshowed the inability of central banks to successfully intervene in currency valuations\nwith the absence of secure economic fundamentals and overwhelming market forces.\nToday, with the assistance of IMF reparation packages and the implementation of\nstricter requirements, Asia’s four little dragons are healthy once again. With inﬂa-\ntionary benchmarks and a revived exporting market, Southeast Asia is building back\nits once prominent stature among the world’s industrialized economic regions. With\nthe experience of evaporating currency reserves under their belt, the Asian tigers\nnow take active initiatives to ensure that there is large pot of reserves on hand in\ncase speculators attempt to attack their currencies once again.\n■Introduction of the Euro (1999)\nThe introduction of the euro was a monumental achievement, marking the largest\nmonetary changeover ever. The euro was ofﬁcially launched as an electronic trading\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS28currency on January 1, 1999. Euro notes and coins were put into circulation in 2002.\nThe 11 initial member states were: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy,\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, and Finland. As of 2015, there\nare 17 countries in the Eurozone. Each country ﬁxed its currency to a speciﬁc\nconversion rate against the euro, and a common monetary policy governed by the\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) was adopted. To many economists, the system would\nideally include all of the original 15 EU nations, but the United Kingdom, Sweden,\nand Denmark decided to keep their own currencies. In deciding whether to adopt\nthe euro, EU members have many important factors to consider.\nThe 1993 Maastricht Treaty sets out ﬁve main convergence criteria for member\nstates to participate in the European Monetary Union (EMU):\nMaastricht Treaty: C onvergence Criteria\n■The country’s government budget deﬁcit could not be greater than 3% of GDP.\n■The country’s government debt could not be larger than 60% of GDP.\n■The country’s exchange rate had to be maintained within ERM bands without any\nrealignment for two years prior to joining.\n■The country’s inﬂation rate could not be higher than 1.5% above the average\ninﬂation rate of the three EU countries with the lowest inﬂation rates.\n■The country’s long-term interest rate on government bonds could not be higher\nthan 2% above the average of the comparable rates in the three countries with the\nlowest inﬂation.\nAlthough the ease of traveling is one of the most attractive reasons to join the\neuro, being part of the monetary union provides other beneﬁts:\n■It eliminates exchange rate ﬂuctuations, providing a more stable environment to\ntrade within the euro area.\n■The purging of all exchange rate risk within the zone allows businesses to plan\ninvestment decisions with greater certainty.\n■Transaction costs also diminish, mainly those relating to foreign exchange\noperations, hedging operations, cross-border payments, and the management of\nseveral currency accounts.\n■Prices become more transparent as consumers and businesses can compare prices\nacross countries more easily, which, in turn, increases competition.\n■A huge single currency market becomes more attractive for foreign investors.\n■The economy’s magnitude and stability allow the ECB to control inﬂation with\nlower interest rates, thanks to increased credibility.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS\nk\nk29\nk\nk\nFIGURE 2.6 EURUSD Price Since Launch\nSource: eSignal\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS30Yet the euro is not without its limitations. Leaving aside political sovereignty\nissues, the main problem is that, by adopting the euro, a nation essentially forfeits\nany independent monetary policy. Since each country’s economy is not perfectly\ncorrelated to the EMU’s economy, a nation might ﬁnd the ECB hiking interest\nrates during a domestic recession. This can be particularly true for many of the\nsmaller nations. As a result, countries try to rely more heavily on ﬁscal policy, but\nthe efﬁciency of ﬁscal policy is limited when it is not effectively combined with\nmonetary policy. This inefﬁciency is further exacerbated by the 3% of GDP limit on\nbudget deﬁcits, as stipulated by the Stability and Growth Pact.\nSome concerns also subsist regarding the ECB’s effectiveness as a central bank.\nThe central bank strives for a 2% inﬂation target, but in the past 15 years, it strayed\naway from this level often. Also, from 1999 to late 2002, a lack of conﬁdence\nin the union’s currency (and in the union itself) led to a 24% depreciation, from\napproximately $1.15 to the euro in January 1999 to $0.88 in May 2000, forcing\nthe ECB to intervene in foreign exchange markets in the last few months of 2000.\nFigure 2.6 shows a daily chart of the euro since it was launched in 1999.\nSince 2000, things have greatly changed, with the euro trading at a premium to\nthe dollar, but quantitative easing in 2014 put the currency back in a downtrend\nversus the dollar. Some analysts claim that the euro will one day replace the dollar\nas the world’s dominant international currency, and while we believe it will have a\ngreater share in reserve portfolios, we doubt that this will be likely.\n31CHAPTER 3\nWhat Moves the\nCurrency Market?\nNow that we know a little bit about the history of the forex market, let’s take a\nlook at what moves currencies. There are two primary ways to analyze ﬁnancial\nmarkets: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis is rooted\nin understanding underlying economic conditions, while technical analysis uses\nhistorical prices to predict future movements. For as long as technical analysis\nhas been around, there has been an ongoing debate as to which methodology\nis more successful. Short-term traders prefer to use technical analysis, focusing\ntheir strategies primarily on price action, while medium-term traders tend to use\nfundamental analysis to determine a currency’s current and future valuation.\nBefore implementing successful trading strategies, it is important to understand\nwhat drives the movements of currencies in the foreign exchange market. The\nbest strategies tend to be the ones that combine both fundamental and technical\nanalysis. Textbook perfect technical formations have failed too often because of\nmajor fundamental news and events like U.S. nonfarm payrolls. But trading on\nfundamentals alone can also be risky. There will oftentimes be sharp gyrations in\nthe price of currency on a day when there are no news or economic reports. This\nsuggests that the price action is driven by nothing more than ﬂows, sentiment, and\npattern formations. Therefore, it is very important for technical traders to be aware\nof the key economic data or events that are scheduled for release, and, in turn,\nfor fundamental traders to be aware of important technical levels that the general\nmarket may be focusing on.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?32■Fundamental Analysis\nFundamental analysis focuses on the economic, social, and political forces that drive\nsupply and demand. Those using fundamental analysis as a trading tool look at\nvarious macroeconomic indicators such as growth rates, interest rates, inﬂation,\nand unemployment. We outlined some of the most important economic releases\nin the ﬁrst chapter of this book. Fundamental analysts will combine all of this\ninformation to assess current and future performance. This requires a lot of work\nand thorough analysis, as there is no single set of beliefs that guides fundamental\nanalysis. Traders employing fundamental analysis need to continually keep abreast\nof news and announcements, as they can indicate potential changes to the economic,\nsocial, and political environment. All traders should be aware of the broad economic\nconditions before placing trades. This is especially important for day traders who\nare trying to make trading decisions based on news events because even though\nFederal Reserve Monetary Policy decisions are always important, if the rate move is\ncompletely priced into the market, then the actual reaction in the EURUSD could\nbe nominal.\nTaking a step back, currencies move primarily based on supply and demand.\nThat is, on the most fundamental level, a currency rallies because there is demand\nfor that currency. Regardless of whether the demand is for hedging, speculative,\nor conversion purposes, true movements are based on the need for the currency.\nCurrency values decrease when there is excess supply. Supply and demand should be\nthe real determinants for predicting future movements. However, how to predict\nsupply and demand is not as simple as many would think. There are many factors\nthat contribute to the net supply and demand for a currency. This includes capital\nﬂows, trade ﬂows, speculative, and hedging needs.\nFor example, the U.S. dollar was very strong (against the euro) between 1999\nand the end of 2001. This rally was driven primarily by the dot-com boom and the\ndesire by foreign investors to participate in these elevated returns. This demand\nfor U.S. assets required foreign investors to sell their local currencies and purchase\nU.S. dollars. Since the end of 2001, geopolitical uncertainty arose, the United States\nstarted cutting interest rates, and foreign investors started to sell U.S. assets in\nsearch of higher yields elsewhere. This required foreign investors to sell U.S. dollars,\nincreasing supply and lowering the dollar’s value against other major currency pairs.\nThe availability of funding or interest in buying a currency is a major factor that can\nimpact the direction that a currency trades. It was one of the primary drivers of the\nU.S. dollar between 2002 and 2005, making foreign ofﬁcial purchases of U.S. assets\n(also known as the Treasury International Capital Flow, or TIC data) an important\neconomic indicator.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?33Capital and Trade Flows\nCapital ﬂows and trade ﬂows constitute a country’s balance of payments, which\nquantiﬁes the amount of demand for a currency over a given period of time.\nTheoretically, a balance of payments equal to zero is required for a currency to\nmaintain its current valuation. A negative balance of payments number, on the other\nhand, indicates that capital is leaving the economy at a more rapid rate than it is\nentering, and hence, it should fall in value.\nThis is particularly important in current conditions (at the time of this book’s\npublication), where the United States is running a consistently large trade deﬁcit\nwithout sufﬁcient foreign inﬂow to fund that deﬁcit. As a result of this very problem,\nthe trade-weighted dollar index fell 22% in value between 2003 and 2005. The\nJapanese yen is another good example. As one of the world’s largest exporters, Japan\nruns a very high trade surplus. Therefore, despite a zero interest rate policy that\nprevents capital ﬂows from increasing, the yen has a natural tendency to trade lower\nbased on trade ﬂows, which is the other side of the equation. To be more speciﬁc,\nfollowing is a more detailed explanation of what capital and trade ﬂows encompass.\nCapital Flows\nCapital ﬂows measure the net amount of a currency that is being purchased or sold\ndue to capital investments. A positive capital ﬂow balance implies that foreign inﬂows\nof physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed outﬂows. A negative\ncapital ﬂow balance indicates that there are more physical or portfolio investments\nbought by domestic investors than foreign investors. There are generally two types\nof capital ﬂows—physical ﬂows and portfolio ﬂows (which are further segmented\ninto equity markets and ﬁxed-income markets).\nPhysical Flows\nPhysical ﬂows encompass actual foreign direct investments by corporations such as\ninvestments in real estate, manufacturing, and local acquisitions. All of these require\nthat a foreign corporation sell its local currency and buy the foreign currency, which\nleads to movements in the FX market. This is particularly important for global\nmergers and corporate acquisitions that involve more cash than stock.\nPhysical ﬂows are important to watch, as they represent the underlying changes\nin actual physical investment activity. These ﬂows shift in response to changes in\neach country’s ﬁnancial health and growth opportunities. Changes in local laws that\nencourage foreign investment also serve to promote physical ﬂows. For example,\ndue to China’s entry into the WTO, its foreign investment laws have been relaxed.\nAs a result of China’s cheap labor and attractive revenue opportunities (population\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?34of over 1 billion), corporations globally have ﬂooded China with investments. From\nan FX perspective, in order to fund investments in China, foreign corporations need\nto sell their local currency and buy Chinese renminbi (RMB).\nPortfolio Flows in Equity Markets\nAs technology has enabled greater ease with respect to transportation of capital,\ninvesting in global equity markets has become far more feasible. Accordingly, a\nrallying stock market in any part of the world serves as an ideal opportunity for all,\nregardless of geographic location. The result of this has become a strong correlation\nbetween a country’s equity markets and its currency: If the equity market is rising,\ninvestment dollars generally come in to seize the opportunity. Alternatively, falling\nequity markets could prompt domestic investors to sell their shares of local publicly\ntraded ﬁrms to take advantage of investment opportunities abroad.\nThe attraction of equity markets over ﬁxed-income markets has increased across\nthe years. Since the early 1990s, the ratio of foreign transactions in U.S. government\nbonds over U.S. equities has declined from 10 to 1 to 2 to 1. As indicated in\nFigure 3.1, it is evident that the Dow had a high correlation (of approximately 81%)\nwith the U.S. dollar (against the EUR) between 1994 and 1999. In addition, from\n1991–1999, the Dow increased 300%, while the USD index appreciated nearly 30%\nfor the same time period. As a result, currency traders closely followed the global\nequity markets to predict short and intermediate term equity-based capital ﬂows.\nHowever, this relationship shifted after the tech bubble burst in the United States as\n1/31/9412500 1. 15\n1. 10\n1 .05\n1 .00\n0.95\n0.90\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n0.70\n0.6511500\n10500\n9500\n8500\n7500\n6500\n5500\n4500\n3500\n6/30/94 11/30/94 4/28/95 9/29/95 2/29/96 7/31/96 12/31/96Dow Jones and USDEUR\n5/30/97 10/31/97 3/31/98 8/31/98 1/29/99 6/30/99 11/30/99INDU Index Px Last USDEUR Curncy\nFIGURE 3.1 Dow and USDEUR\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?35foreign investors remained relatively risk averse causing a lower correlation between\nthe performance of the U.S. equity market and the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, a\nrelationship still exists, making it important for all traders to keep an eye on global\nmarket performances in search of intermarket opportunities.\nPortfolio Flows in Fixed-Income Markets\nJust as the equity market is correlated to exchange rate movement, so too is the\nﬁxed-income market. In times of global uncertainty, ﬁxed-income investments can\nbecome particularly appealing, due to the inherent safety they possess. As a result,\neconomies boasting the most valuable ﬁxed-income opportunities will be capable of\nattracting foreign investment—which will naturally ﬁrst require the purchasing of\nthe country’s respective currency.\nA good gauge of ﬁxed-income capital ﬂows are the short- and long-term yields of\ninternational government bonds. It is important to monitor the spread differential\nbetween the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the yield on foreign bonds because\ninternational investors tend to move money from one country to another in search\nof the highest yielding assets. When U.S. assets have one of the highest yields,\nthis encourages more investments in U.S. ﬁnancial instruments, hence beneﬁting\nthe U.S. dollar. When the United States has the lowest yields, this discourages\ninvestments. Investors can also use short-term yields, such as the spreads on 2-year\ngovernment bonds, to gauge the short-term ﬂow of international funds. Aside from\ngovernment bond yields, Fed fund futures can also be used to estimate movement\nof U.S. funds, as they price in the expectation of future Fed interest rate policy.\nEuribor futures are a barometer for the Euro region’s expected future interest rates\nand can give an indication of EU future policy movements. We will discuss how to\nuse ﬁxed-income products to trade FX further in our strategy section.\nTrade Flows: Measuring Exports versus Imports\nTrade ﬂows are the basis of all international transactions. Just as the investment\nenvironment of a given economy is a key driver of its currency valuation, trade ﬂows\nrepresent a country’s net trade balance. Countries that are net exporters—meaning\nthey sell more goods abroad than they buy—will experience a net trade surplus.\nCountries that are net exporters are more likely to have their currency rise in value\nbecause from the perspective of international trade, their currency is being bought\nmore than it is sold. This impacts currency ﬂows because international clients buying\nthe exported product/service must ﬁrst buy the currency of the exporting nation.\nCountries who are net importers purchase more goods abroad than they sell,\ncreating a trade deﬁcit. These nations will generally see more downward than\nupward pressure on their currencies because in order to purchase these foreign\ngoods, importers must sell their own currency and purchase the currency of the\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?36country from which they are buying the good or service. This accordingly drives\ndown the value of the currency when all else is equal. This concept is important\nbecause it is one of primary reasons why many economists say that certain currencies\nneed to fall to reverse burgeoning trade deﬁcits.\nTo understand this further, let’s imagine that the UK economy is booming,\nand its stock market is performing well. Meanwhile, in the United States, a\nlackluster economy is creating a shortage of investment opportunities. In this type\nof environment U.S. investors will feel more inclined to sell their U.S. dollars and\nbuy British pounds to participate in the outperformance of the UK economy. When\nthey elect to do so, it results in the outﬂow of capital from the United States and\nthe inﬂow of capital into the United Kingdom. From an exchange rate perspective,\nthis would induce a fall in the USD coupled with a rise in the GBP, as demand for\nUSD declines and the demand for GBP increases, translating into strength for the\nGBP/USD currency pair.\nEven day and swing traders will ﬁnd it valuable to keep up with incoming\neconomic reports from the major economies.\nTrading Tip: Charting Economic Surprises\nOne way for traders to stay on top of economic trends is to chart economic data\nsurprises against price action. Figure 3.2 illustrates how this can be done. The chart\ngraphs how much an economic indicator has deviated from its consensus forecast,\nor the ‘‘surprise,’’ and stacks them on the same side and graphs price (blue line)\naction when the data was release against the surprise, with a simple regression line\n(white line). This can be done for all of the major currency pairs and provides a\nvisual guide to understanding whether price action has been in line with economic\nfundamentals and can be used as a guide to future price action. Economic data can\nbe found on the calendars of any major forex website, and price action can generally\nbe downloaded from your trading platforms.\nAccording to Figure 3.2, in November of 2004, there were 14 out of 15 positive\neconomic surprises and yet the dollar sold off against the euro during the month\nof December, which was the month in which the economic data were released.\nAlthough this methodology is not exact, the analysis is simple and past charts\nhave yielded some extremely useful clues to future price action. Figure 3.3 shows\nhow the EURUSD moved the following month. As you can see, the EURUSD\nquickly corrected itself during the month of January, indicating that the fundamental\ndivergence from price action that occurred in December proved to be quite useful\nto dollar longs, which harvested almost 600 pips as the euro quickly retracted a large\npart of its gains in January. This method of analysis, called variant perception, was ﬁrst\ninvented by the legendary hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, who produced\n24% average rates return for 30 consecutive years.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?37US Dollar Data and EURUSD\n1 .3700\n1 .3600\n1 .3500\n1 .3400\n1 .3300\n1 .3200\n1. 3 10 0\n1 .3000\n–100%–26.11%0.00%0.00%1.41%1.46%2.56%2.81%3.55%4.18%14.29%16.67%33.33%43.48%50.25%140.00%\n–50% 0% 50%Durable Goods\nEmpire State Manufacturing\nPhilly Fed\nLeading Economic Indicators\nPersonal Income\nIndustrial Production\nISM Non-Manufacturing\nCurrent Account\nExisting Home Sales\nGDP Annualized\nU.

Large positive and negative\nsurprises in economic data can often yield clues to future price action. If you go back\nand look at the EURUSD charts, you will see that the record current account deﬁcits\nin October 2004 were the catalyst that sent the dollar plunging over the next two\nmonths. In many ways, economic fundamentals matter more in the foreign exchange\nmarket than in any other market, and charts such as these could provide valuable\nclues to price direction. Generally, the 15 most important economic indices are\nchosen from each region, and then a price regression line is superimposed over the\npast 20 days of price data.\n■Technical Analysis\nPrior to the mid-1980s, fundamental traders dominated the FX market. However,\nwith the rising popularity of technical analysis and the advent of new technologies,\nthe inﬂuence of technical trading on the FX market has increased signiﬁcantly. The\navailability of high leverage also led to an increased number of high frequency and\nmomentum. They have become active participants in the FX market, with the acute\nability to inﬂuence currency prices.\nUnlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses on the study of price\nmovements. Technical analysts use historical currency data to forecast the direction\nof future prices. The underlying belief behind technical analysis is that all current\nmarket information is already reﬂected in the price of that currency; therefore,\nstudying price action is all that is required to make informed trading decisions. In a\nnutshell, technical analysis assumes that history will repeat itself.\nTechnical analysis is an extremely popular tool used by short- and medium-term\ntraders for analyzing the forex market. It works especially well in the currency\nmarkets because short-term currency price ﬂuctuations are primarily driven by\nhuman emotions or market perceptions. The primary tool in technical analysis\nis price and charts. Traders will look for trends and patterns to identify trading\nopportunities. The most basic concept of technical analysis is that markets have a\ntendency to trend. Being able to identify trends in their earliest stage of development\nis the key to technical analysis. Range trading is also very popular, and similar tools\ncan be used to identify these setups. Technical analysis integrates price action and\nmomentum to construct a pictorial representation of past currency price action and\nto use this information to predict future performance. Technical analysis tools such\nas Fibonacci retracement levels, moving averages, oscillators, candlestick charts, and\nBollinger bands provide further information on the value of the emotional extremes\nof buyers and sellers. It also helps to gauge when greed and fear are the strongest.\nThere are basically two types of markets, trending or range bound, and in the trade\nparameters section, we outline some rules that can help traders determine the type\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?39of market they trading in right now and the sort of trading opportunities they should\nbe looking for.\nIs Technical Analysis or Fundamental Analysis Better?\nNo one will ever win the age-long battle between technical and fundamental analysis.\nHowever, most individual traders will start trading with technical analysis because\nit is easier to understand and does not require hours of study. Technical analysts can\nalso follow many currencies and markets at one time, whereas fundamental analysts\ntend to focus on a few pairs due to the overwhelming amount of data in the market.\nNonetheless, technical analysis works well because the currency market tends to\ndevelop strong trends. Once technical analysis is mastered, it can be applied with\nequal ease to any time frame or currency traded.\nHowever, it is important to take both strategies into consideration, as fundamental\nanalysis can trigger technical movements such as breakouts or reversal in trends.\nTechnical analysis, on the other hand, can also explain moves that fundamentals\ncannot, especially in quiet markets, causing resistance in trends or unexplainable\nmovements. For example, as shown in Figure 3.4, in the days leading up to\nSeptember 11, USDJPY had just broken out of a triangle formation and looked\npoised to head higher. However, as the chart indicates, instead of breaking higher as\ntechnicians may have anticipated, USDJPY broke down following the September 11,\n2001, terrorist attacks and ended up hitting a low of 115.81 from a high of 121.88\non September 10.\n■Currency Forecasting—What Bookworms\nand Economists Look At\nFor more avid students of foreign exchange who want to learn more about\nfundamental analysis and valuing currencies, this section examines the different\nmodels of currency forecasting used by analysts of the major investment banks.\nThere are seven major models for forecasting currencies, which include the balance\nof payments theory, purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, the monetary\nmodel, the real interest rate differential model, the asset market model, and the\ncurrency substitution model.\nBalance of Payments Theory\nThe balance of payments theory states that exchange rates should be at their\nequilibrium level, which is the rate that produces a stable current account balance.\nCountries with trade deﬁcits experience a run on their foreign exchange reserves\ndue to the fact that exporters to that nation must sell that nation’s currency in order\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?k\nk40k\nk\nFIGURE 3.4 USDJPY September 11th Chart\nSource: eSignal\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?41to receive payment. The cheaper currency makes the nation’s exports less expensive\nabroad, which in turn fuels exports and brings the currency into balance.\nWhat Is the Balance of Payments (BOP)?\nThe balance of payments account is divided into two parts: the current account and\nthe capital account. The current account measures trade in tangible, visible items\nsuch as cars and manufactured goods; the trade balance is the surplus or deﬁcit\nbetween exports and imports. The capital account measures ﬂows of money, such\nas investments for stocks or bonds. Balance of payments data can be found on the\nwebsite of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nTrade Flows\nThe trade balance of a country shows the net difference over a period of time\nbetween a nation’s exports and imports. When a country imports more than it\nexports, the trade balance is negative or is in a deﬁcit. If the country exports more\nthan it imports, the trade balance is positive or is in a surplus. The trade balance\nreﬂects the redistribution of wealth among countries and is a major channel through\nwhich the macroeconomic policies of a country may affect another.\nIn general, if a country has a trade deﬁcit, it is considered to be unfavorable, since\nit negatively impacts the value of the nation’s currency. For example, if U.S. trade\nﬁgures show greater imports than exports, more dollars ﬂow out of the United\nStates and the value of the U.S. currency depreciates. A positive trade balance,\nin comparison, will affect the dollar by causing it to appreciate against the other\ncurrencies.\nCapital Flows\nIn addition to trade ﬂows, there are also capital ﬂows that occur among countries.\nThey record a nation’s incoming and outgoing investment ﬂows, such as payments\nfor entire or parts of companies, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, real estate, and\nfactories. Capital ﬂows are inﬂuenced by many factors, including the ﬁnancial and\neconomic climate of other countries, and can be in the form of physical or portfolio\ninvestments. In general, in developing countries, the composition of capital ﬂows\ntends to be skewed toward foreign direct investment (FDI) and bank loans. For\ndeveloped countries, due to the strength of the equity and ﬁxed-income markets,\nstocks and bonds appear to be more important than bank loans and FDI.\nEquity Markets\nEquity markets have a signiﬁcant impact on exchange rate movements because\nthey are a major place for high-volume currency movements. Their importance is\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?42considerable for the currencies of countries with developed capital markets, where\na great amount of capital inﬂows and outﬂows occur, and where foreign investors\nare major participants. The amount of the foreign investment ﬂows in the equity\nmarkets is dependent on the general health and growth of the market, reﬂecting\nthe well-being of companies and particular sectors. Movements of currencies occur\nwhen foreign investors move their money to a particular equity market. Thus,\nthey convert their capital in a domestic currency and push the demand for it\nhigher, making the currency appreciate. When the equity markets are experiencing\nrecessions, however, foreign investors tend to ﬂee, thus converting back to their\nhome currency and pushing the domestic currency down.\nFixed-Income (Bond) Markets\nThe effect that ﬁxed-income markets have on currencies is similar to that of the\nequity markets and is a result of capital movements. An investor’s interest in the\nﬁxed-income market depends on the company’s speciﬁcs and credit rating, as well as\non the general health of the economy and the country’s interest rates. The movement\nof foreign capital into and out of ﬁxed-income markets leads to change in the demand\nand supply for currencies, hence impacting the currencies’ exchange rates.\nSummary of Trade and Capital Flows\nDetermining and understanding a country’s balance of payments is perhaps the\nmost important and useful tool for those interested in fundamental analysis. Any\ninternational transaction gives rise to two offsetting entries: trade ﬂow balance\n(current account) and capital ﬂow balance (capital account). If the trade ﬂow balance\nis a negative outﬂow, the country is buying more from foreigners than it sells\n(imports exceed exports). When it is a positive inﬂow, the country is selling more\nthan it buys (exports exceed imports). The capital ﬂow balance is positive when\nforeign inﬂows of physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed that\ncountry’s outﬂows. A capital ﬂow is negative when a country buys more physical or\nportfolio investments than are sold to foreign investors.\nThese two entries, trade and capital ﬂow, when added together signify a country’s\nbalance of payments. In theory, the two entries should balance and add up to zero\nin order to provide for the maintenance of the status quo in a nation’s economy and\ncurrency rates.\nIn general, countries might experience positive or negative trade, as well as\npositive or negative capital ﬂow balances. In order to minimize the net effect of\nthe two on the exchange rates, a country should try to maintain a balance between\nthe two. For example, in the United States, there is a substantial trade deﬁcit, as\nmore is imported than is exported. When the trade balance is negative, the country\nis buying more from foreigners than it sells, and therefore it needs to ﬁnance its\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?43deﬁcit. This negative trade ﬂow might be offset by a positive capital ﬂow into the\ncountry, as foreigners buy either physical or portfolio investments. Therefore, the\nUnited States seeks to minimize its trade deﬁcit and maximize its capital inﬂows,\nwith hopes that the two will balance out.\nA change in this balance is extremely signiﬁcant and carries ramiﬁcations that\nrun deep into economic policy and currency exchange levels. The net result of the\ndifference between the trade and capital ﬂows, positive or negative, will impact the\ndirection in which the nation’s currency will move. If the overall trade and capital\nbalance is negative, it will result in a depreciation of the nation’s currency, and if\npositive, it will lead to an appreciation of the currency.\nClearly, a change in the balance of payments carries a direct effect for currency\nlevels. It is therefore possible for any investor to observe economic data relating to\nthis balance and interpret the results that will occur. Data relating to capital and\ntrade ﬂows should be followed most closely. For instance, if an analyst observes\nan increase in the U.S. trade deﬁcit and a decrease in the capital ﬂows, a balance\nof payments deﬁcit would occur, and as a result, an investor may anticipate a\ndepreciation of the dollar.\nLimitations of BOP Model\nThe BOP model mainly focuses on traded goods and services, while ignoring\ninternational capital ﬂows. Indeed, international capital ﬂows often dwarfed trade\nﬂows in the currency markets toward the end of the 1990s, and this oftentimes\nbalanced out the current account of debtor nations like the United States.\nFor example, in 1999, 2000, and 2001, the United States maintained a large\ncurrent account deﬁcit while the Japanese ran a large current account surplus.\nHowever, during this same period in time the U.S. dollar rose against the yen even\nthough trade ﬂows were running against the dollar. The reason was that capital ﬂows\nbalanced out trade ﬂows, thus defying the BOP’s forecasting model for a period of\ntime. Indeed, the increase in capital ﬂows has given rise to the asset market model .\nNote: It is probably a misnomer to call this theory the balance of payments theory\nsince it only takes into account the current account balance, not the actual balance\nof payments. However, until the 1990s capital ﬂows played a very small role in the\nworld economy, so the main statistic viewed was the trade balance, which made up\nthe bulk of the balance of payments for most nations.\nPurchasing Power Parity\nThepurchasing power parity (PPP) theory is based on the belief that foreign exchange\nrates should be determined by the relative prices of a similar basket of goods between\ntwo countries. Any change in a nation’s inﬂation rate should be balanced by an\nopposite change in that nation’s exchange rate. Therefore, according to this theory,\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?44when a country’s prices are rising due to inﬂation, that country’s exchange rate\nshould depreciate in order to return to parity.\nPPP’s Basket of Goods\nThe basket of goods and services priced for the PPP exercise is a sample of all goods\nand services covered by GDP. It includes consumer goods and services, government\nservices, equipment goods, and construction projects. More speciﬁcally, consumer\nitems include food, beverages, tobacco, clothing, footwear, rents, water supply,\ngas, electricity, medical goods and services, furniture and furnishings, household\nappliances, personal transport equipment, fuel, transport services, recreational\nequipment, recreational and cultural services, telephone services, education services,\ngoods and services for personal care and household operation, and repair and\nmaintenance services.\nBig Mac Index\nOne of the most well-known examples of PPP is The Economist ’s Big Mac Index. The\nBig Mac PPP calculates the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the\nsame in America as elsewhere. Comparing these with actual rates helps to signal if\na currency is under- or overvalued. As described by The Economist, the index is a\nlightheartedly guide to currency valuation. It was never intended as a precise gauge\nof currency misalignment, but merely a tool to make exchange-rate theory more\ndigestible.\nFor example, in January 2015, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and\nChinese yuan was approximately 6.20. At the time, a Big Mac cost $4.79 in the\nUnited States. In China, the same burger cost 17.15 yuan, or approximately $2.77\nat market exchange. This means that based on the comparison between the two\nburger prices, the Chinese yuan was undervalued by 42%.\nOECD Purchasing Power Parity Index\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) releases a\nmore formal index. Under a joint OECD-Eurostat PPP Program, the OECD and\nEurostat share the responsibility for calculating PPPs. Their latest information on\nwhich currencies are under- or overvalued against the U.S. dollar can be found\non the OECD website at www.oecd.org. The OECD publishes a table that shows\nthe price levels for the major industrialized countries. Each column shows the\nnumber of speciﬁed monetary units needed in each of the countries listed to buy\nthe same representative basket of consumer goods and services. In each case,\nthe representative basket costs a hundred units in the country whose currency is\nspeciﬁed. The chart that is then created compares the PPP of a currency with its\nactual exchange rate. The chart is updated weekly to reﬂect the current exchange\nrate. It is also updated about twice a year to reﬂect new estimates of PPP. The\nPPP estimates are taken from studies carried out by the OECD; however, it should\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?45not be taken as deﬁnitive. Different methods of calculation will arrive at different\nPPP rates.\nAccording to the OECD’s data as of April 17, 2015, the PPP value of the\nAustralian dollar versus the U.S. dollar based on GDP is 0.6712. At the time, the\nAUD/USD exchange rate was 0.7812. Using this model of valuation, this indicates\nthat the Australian dollar was 14% overvalued.\nLimitations to Using Purchasing Power Parity\nPPP theory should only be used for long-term fundamental analysis. While the\neconomic forces behind PPP will eventually equalize the purchasing power of\ncurrencies, this can take many years. A time horizon of 5–10 years is typical.\nPPP’s major weakness is that it assumes goods can be traded easily, without regard\nto such things as tariffs, quotas, or taxes. For example, when the U.S. government\nannounces new tariffs on imported steel, the cost of domestic manufactured goods\ngoes up; but those increases will not be reﬂected in the U.S. PPP tables.\nThere are other factors that must also be considered when weighing PPP: inﬂation,\ninterest rate differentials, economic releases/reports, asset markets, trade ﬂows,\nand political developments. Indeed, PPP is just one of several theories traders should\nuse when determining exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Parity\nThe interest rate parity theory states that if two different currencies have different\ninterest rates, then that difference should be reﬂected in the premium or discount\nfor the forward exchange rate to prevent riskless arbitrage.\nFor example, if U.S. interest rates are 3% and Japanese interest rates are 1%,\nthen the U.S. dollar should depreciate against the Japanese yen by 2% in order\nto prevent riskless arbitrage. This future exchange rate is reﬂected in the forward\nexchange rate stated today. In our example, the forward exchange rate of the dollar\nis said to be at discount because it buys fewer Japanese yen in the forward rate than\nit does in the spot rate. The yen is said to be at a premium.\nInterest rate parity has shown very little proof of effectiveness in recent years.\nOftentimes, currencies with higher interest rates rise and attract incoming invest-\nment, while currencies with low and falling interest rates decline as outﬂows slow.\nThe Monetary Model\nAccording to the monetary model, exchange rates are determined by a nation’s\nmonetary policy. The premise is that countries that follow a stable monetary policy\nover time should have appreciating currencies. Countries that have erratic monetary\npolicies or excessively expansionist policies should see the value of their currency\ndepreciate.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?46How to Use the Monetary Model\nThree factors inﬂuence exchange rates under this theory:\n1. A nation’s money supply\n2. Expected future levels of a nation’s money supply\n3. The growth rate of a nation’s money supply\nAll of these factors are key to understanding and spotting a monetary trend that\nmay force a change in exchange rates. For example, let’s assume that the Japanese\neconomy has been slipping in and out of recession for over a decade. Interest rates\nare near zero and annual budget deﬁcits prevent the Japanese from spending their\nway out of recession, which leaves only one tool left at the disposal of Japanese\nofﬁcials determined to revive Japan’s economy: printing more money. By buying\nstocks and bonds, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is increasing the nation’s money supply,\nwhich produces inﬂation, and this forces a change in the exchange rate. The example\nin Figure 3.5 illustrates the effect of money supply changes to the Japanese yen using\nthe monetary model.\nIndeed, it is in the area of excessive expansionary monetary policy that the\nmonetary model is most successful. One of the only ways a country can keep\nits currency from sharply devaluing is by pursuing a tight monetary policy. For\nexample, during the Asian Currency Crisis, the Hong Kong dollar came under\nattack from speculators. Hong Kong ofﬁcials raised interest rates to 300% to halt\nthe Hong Kong dollar from being dislodged from its peg to the U.S. dollar. The\ntactic worked perfectly, as speculators were cleared out by such sky-high interest\nrates. The downside was that the Hong Kong economy would slide into recession.\nBut in the end, the peg held and the monetary model worked.\nLimitations of the Monetary Model\nVery few economists rely solely on this model because it does not take into account\ntrade ﬂows and capital ﬂows. For example, throughout 2014 Australia had higher\ninterest rates, growth rates, and inﬂation rates than both the United States and the\nEuropean Union, yet, the AUD appreciated in value against both the dollar and the\neuro. Indeed, the monetary model has greatly struggled since the dawn of freely\nCHANGE IN MONEY\nSUPPL Y\nY en Is Printed Increase in Y en Creates\nInflationY en Depreciates in ValueCHANGE IN EXCHANGE\nRATECHANGE IN PRICE\nLEVEL\nFIGURE 3.5 Monetary Model\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?47ﬂoating currencies. The model holds that high interest rates signal growing inﬂation,\nwhich it often does, followed by a depreciating currency. But this does not take into\naccount the capital inﬂows that would take effect as a result of higher interest yields\nor of an equity market that may be thriving in a booming economy—thus causing\nthe currency to possibly appreciate.\nIn any case, the monetary model is one of several valuation tools that can be\nemployed in tandem with other models to determine the direction an exchange rate\nis heading.\nReal Interest Rate Differential Model\nAccording to the real interest rate differential theory, exchange rate movements are\ndetermined by a country’s interest rate. The idea is that countries with high interest\nrates should see their currency appreciate in value, while countries with low interest\nrates should see their currency depreciate in value.\nBasics of the Model\nThe basic premise of the model is that when a country raises its interest rates,\ninternational investors will buy that currency because they ﬁnd its yield more\nattractive. When a country lowers interest rates, they sell the currency. Figure 3.6\nUK\nUKInterest Rates vs. United States Eurozone\nEurozone2003 Percent.

The Australian dollar had the\nlargest basis point spread and also had the highest return against the U.S. dollar,\nwhich seems to vindicate the model, as investors bought up higher-yielding Aussie.\nThe same can be said for the New Zealand dollar, which also had a higher yield\nthan the U.S. dollar and gained 27% against USD. Yet the model becomes less\nconvincing when comparing the euro, which gained 20% against the dollar (more\nthan every currency except NZD), even though its basis point differential was\nonly 100 points. The model then comes under serious question when comparing\nthe British pound and the Japanese yen. The yen differential is –100, and yet it\nappreciated almost 12% against the dollar. Meanwhile, the British pound gained\nonly 11% against the dollar even though it had a whopping 275 point interest rate\ndifferential.\nThis model also stresses that one of the key factors in determining the severity of\nan exchange rate’s response to a shift in interest rates is the expected persistence of\nthat shift. Simply put, a rise in interest rates that is expected to last for ﬁve years\nwill have a much larger impact on the exchange rate than if that rise were expected\nto last for only one year.\nLimitations to the Interest Rate Model\nThere is a great deal of debate among international economists over whether there\nis a strong and statistically signiﬁcant link between changes in a nation’s interest rate\nand currency price. The main weakness of this model is that it does not take into\naccount a nation’s current account balance, relying on capital ﬂows instead. Indeed,\nthe model tends to overemphasize capital ﬂows at the expense of numerous other\nfactors, such as political stability, inﬂation, and poor economic growth. Absent these\ntypes of factors, the model can be very useful, since it is quite logical to conclude\nthat an investor will naturally gravitate toward the investment vehicle that pays a\nhigher reward.\nThe Asset Market Model\nThe basic premise of the asset market model theory is that the ﬂow of funds into the\nﬁnancial assets of a country such as equities and bonds increases the demand for that\ncountry’s currency (and vice versa). As proof, advocates point out that the amount\nof funds that are placed in investment products such as stocks and bonds now dwarf\nthe amount of funds that is exchanged as a result of the transactions in goods and\nservices for import and export purposes. The asset market theory is basically the\nopposite of the balance of payments theory since it takes into account a nation’s\ncapital account instead of its current account.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?49A Dollar-Driven Theory\nThroughout 1999, many experts argued that the dollar would fall against the euro\non the grounds of the expanding U.S. current account deﬁcit and an overvalued\nWall Street. That was based on the rationale that non-U.S. investors would begin\nwithdrawing their funds from U.S. stocks and bonds into more economically sound\nmarkets, which would weigh signiﬁcantly on the dollar. Yet, such fears have lingered\nsince the early 1980s when the U.S. current account soared to a record high 3.5%\nof GDP.\nIn the two decades that followed, the balance of payments approach in assessing\nthe dollar’s behavior has given way to the asset market approach. This theory\ncontinues to hold the most sway over pundits due to the enormity of U.S. capital\nmarkets. In May and June of 2002, the dollar plummeted over 1000 points versus\nthe yen at the same time equity investors ﬂed U.S. equity markets due to the\naccounting scandals that were plaguing Wall Street. As the scandals subsided toward\nthe end of 2002, the dollar rose 500 points from a low of 115.43 to close at 120.00\nagainst the yen, even though the current account balance remained in massive deﬁcit\nthe entire time.\nLimitations to the Asset Market Theory\nIt is frequently argued that over the long run, there is no relationship between\na nation’s equity market performance and the performance of its currency. See\nFigure 3.7 for a comparison. Between April 2014 and April 2015, the German DAX\nand EURUSD have a very weak correlation.\nAlso, what happens to a nation’s currency when the stock market is trading\nsideways—stuck between bullish and bearish sentiments? That was the scenario in\n6/11/14 7/11/14 8/11/14 9/11/1410/11/14 11/11/14 12/11/141/11/15 2/11/15 3/11/15 4/11/15 5/11/15 6/11/15EURUSD and DAX\n13000\n12500\n12000\n11500\n11000\n10500\n10000\n9500\n9000\n80001.4\n1.35\n1.3\n1.2\n11.051.11.151.25\n8500\nEURUSD BGN Curncy (R1) DAX  INDEX (R2)\nFIGURE 3.7 The DAX Index and the EURUSD\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?50Germany for much of 2014, and currency traders found themselves going back to\nolder money making models, such as interest rate arbitrage, as a result. Only time\nwill tell whether the asset market model will hold up or merely be a short-term blip\non the currency forecasting radar.\nThe Currency Substitution Model\nThe currency substitution model is an enhanced version of the monetary model\nbecause it takes into account investor ﬂows. It posits that the shifting of private\nand public portfolios from one nation to another can have a signiﬁcant effect on\nexchange rates. The ability of individuals to change their assets from domestic and\nforeign currencies is known as currency substitution. When this model is added\nto the monetary model, evidence shows that shifts in expectations of a nation’s\nmoney supply can have a decided impact on that nation’s exchange rates. Simply\nput, investors are looking at monetary model data and coming to the conclusion\nthat a change in money ﬂow is about to occur, thus affecting the exchange rate, so\nthey are investing accordingly, which turns the monetary model into a self-fulﬁlling\nprophecy. Investors who subscribe to this theory are merely jumping on the currency\nsubstitution model bandwagon on the way to the monetary model party.\nThe Yen Example\nIn the monetary model we talked about how the Japanese government was basically\nprinting yen and increasing the money supply when it bought stocks and bonds.\nMonetary model theorists would say that this monetary growth would spark inﬂation\n(more yen chasing fewer products), decrease demand for the yen, and ﬁnally cause\nthe yen to depreciate. A currency substitution theorist would agree with this scenario\nand look to take advantage of this view by shorting the yen, or if they were long\nthe yen promptly getting out of the position. By taking this action, our yen trader\nis helping to drive the market precisely in that direction, thus making the monetary\nmodel theory a fate accompli. The step-by-step process is illustrated in Figure 3.8.\nA. Japan announces new stock and bond buyback plan. Economists are now\npredicting Japan’s money supply will dramatically increase.\nB. Economists are also predicting a rise in inﬂation with the introduction of this\nnew policy. Speculators expect a change in the exchange rate as a result.\nC. Economists expect interest rates to rise and inﬂation takes hold in the economy.\nSpeculators start selling short the yen in anticipation of a change in the exchange\nrate.\nD. Demand for the yen plummets as money ﬂows easily through the Japanese\neconomy and speculators dump yen in the markets.\nE. The exchange rate for the Japanese yen changes dramatically as the yen falls\nin value to foreign currencies, especially those that are easily substituted by\ninvestors (read: liquid yen crosses).\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?51Forecast of\nFuture\nMonetary\nGrowth Forecast of\nFuture InflationChange in\nExchange RateChange in Real\nMoney Demand\nChange in\nExpected\nExchange RateChange in\nDemand for\nForeign Cash\nAB CD EForecast of\nFuture Inflation\nFIGURE 3.8 Currency Substitution Model\nLimitations of the Currency Substitution Model\nAmong the major, actively traded currencies, this model has not yet shown itself\nto be a convincing, single determinant for exchange rate movements. While this\ntheory can be used with more conﬁdence in underdeveloped countries where ‘‘hot\nmoney’’ rushes in and out of emerging markets with enormous effect, there are\nstill too many variables not accounted for by the currency substitution model. For\nexample, using the yen illustration in Figure 3.8, even though Japan may try to spark\ninﬂation with its securities’ buyback plan, it still has an enormous current account\nsurplus that will continually prop up the yen. Also, Japan has numerous political\nlandmines it must avoid in its own neighborhood, and should Japan make it clear\nthat it is trying to devalue its currency, there will be enormous repercussions. These\nare just two of many factors the substitution model does not take into consideration.\nHowever, this model (like numerous other currency models) should be considered\npart of an overall, balanced, FX forecasting diet."

Traditionally, it is the platform through which governments, businesses,\ninvestors, travelers, and other interested parties convert or ‘‘exchange’’ currency.\nAt its most fundamental level, the foreign exchange market is an over-the-counter\n(OTC) market with no central exchange and clearing house where orders are\nmatched. FX dealers and market makers around the world are linked to each other\naround-the-clock via telephone, computer, and fax, creating one cohesive market.\nThrough the years, this has changed with many institutions offering exchange traded\nFX instruments, but all of the prices are still derived from the underlying or spot\nforex market.\nIn the past two decades, foreign exchange, also known as forex orFX,became\navailable to trade by individual retail investors, and this access caused the market\nto explode in popularity. In the early 2000s, the Bank of International Settlements\nreported a 57% increase in volume between Ap ril 2001 and 2004. At the time more\nthan $1.9 trillion were changing hands on a daily basis. After the ﬁnancial crisis in\n2008, the pace of growth eased to a still- respectable 32% between 2010 and 2013,\nbut the actual volume that changed hands was signiﬁcantly larger at an average of\n$5.3 trillion per day. To put this into perspective, it is 50 times greater than the\ndaily trading volume of the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ combined.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET2While the growth of the retail foreign exchange market contributed to this surge\nin volume, an increase in volatility over the past few years also made investors\nmore aware of how currency movements can impact the equity and bond markets.\nIf stocks, bonds, and commodity traders want to make more educated trading\ndecisions, it is important for them to also follow forex movements. What follows\nare some of the examples of how currency ﬂuctuations impacted stock and bond\nmarket movements in past years.\n■EURUSD and Corporate Proﬁtability\nFor stock market traders, particularly those who invest in European corporations that\nexport a tremendous amount of goods to the United States, monitoring exchange\nrates are essential to predicting earnings and corporate proﬁtability. Throughout 2003\nand 2004, European manufacturers complained extensively about the rapid rise in the\neuro and the weakness in the U.S. dollar. The main culprit for the dollar’s selloff at\nthe time was the country’s rapidly growing trade and budget deﬁcits. This caused the\nEURUSD exchange rate to surge, which took a signiﬁcant toll on the proﬁtability of\nEuropean corporations because a higher exchange rate makes the goods of European\nexporters more expensive to U.S. consumers. In 2003, inadequate hedging shaved\napproximately EUR$1 billion euros from Volkswagen’s proﬁts, while DSM, a Dutch\nchemicals group, warned that a 1% move in the EURUSD rate would reduce proﬁts\nby EUR$7 million to EUR$11 million. Unfortunately, inadequate hedging is still a\nreality in Europe, which makes monitoring the EURUSD exchange rate even more\nimportant in forecasting the earnings and proﬁtability of European exporters.\n■Nikkei and U.S. Dollar\nTraders exposed to Japanese equities also need to be aware of the developments\nthat are occurring in the U.S. dollar and ho w that affects the Nikkei rally. Japan\nrecently came out of 10 years of stagnation. During this time, mutual funds and\nhedge funds were grossly underweight Japanese equities. When the economy began\nto turn around, global macro funds rushed to make changes to their portfolios in fear\nof missing out on a great opportunity to take advantage of Japan’s recovery. Hedge\nfunds borrowed signiﬁcant amount of dollars to pay for increased exposure, but the\nproblem was that their borrowings were very sensitive to U.S. interest rates and the\nFed’s monetary policy tightening cycle. Increased borrowing costs forthe dollar could\nderail the Nikkei’s rally because higher rates will raise the dollar’s ﬁnancing costs. Yet\nwith the huge current account deﬁcit, the Fed might need to continue raising rates\nto increase the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Therefore, continual\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET3rate hikes, coupled with slowing growth in Japan, may make it less proﬁtable for\nfunds to be overleveraged and overly exposed to Japanese stocks. As a result, how\nthe U.S. dollar moves also plays a role on the future direction of the Nikkei.\n■George Soros\nKnown as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England,’’ George Soros is one of\nthe most well-known traders in the FX market. We discuss his adventures in\nmore detail in Chapter 2, but in a nutshell, in 1990, England decided to join\nthe Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) system because it wanted to take part in\nthe stable and low-inﬂation environment created by the Bundesbank, the central\nbank of Germany. This alliance tied the pound to the deutschmark, which meant\nthat the United Kingdom was subject to the monetary policies enforced by the\nBundesbank. In the early 1990s, Germany aggressively increased interest rates to\navoid the inﬂationary effects related to German reuniﬁcation. However, national\npride and the commitment of ﬁxing exchange rates within the ERM prevented\nEngland from devaluing the pound. On Wednesday, September 16, also known as\nBlack Wednesday, George Soros leveraged the entire value of his fund ($1 billion) and\nsold $10 billion worth of pounds to bet against the ERM. This essentially ‘‘broke’’\nthe Bank of England and forced it to devalue the pound. In a matter of 24 hours, the\nBritish pound fell approximately 5%, or 5000 pips. The Bank of England promised\nto raise rates in order to tempt speculators to buy pounds. As a result, this caused\ntremendous volatility in the bond markets, with 1-month UK LIBOR rates rising\n1% and then retracing those gains over the next 24 hours. If bond traders were\ncompleted oblivious to what was going on in the currency markets, they would have\nprobably found themselves dumbstruck in face of such rapid gyration in yields.\n■Chinese Yuan Revaluation and Bonds\nFor Treasury traders, there’s another currency-related issue that is important to\nfollow and that is the gradual revaluation of the Chinese yuan. For most of its history,\nthe yuan or renminbi (RMB) was pegged to the U.S. dollar. In the 1980s, the RMB\nwas devalued to promote growth in C hina’s economy, and between 1997 and 2005\nthe People’s Bank of China artiﬁcially maintained a USDRMB rate of 8.27. At the\ntime, it received signiﬁcant criticism because keeping the peg meant that the Chinese\ngovernment would artiﬁcially weaken its currency to make Chinese goods more\ncompetitive. To maintain the band, the Chinese government had to sell the yuan and\nbuy U.S. dollars each time their currency appreciated above the band’s upper limit.\nThese dollars were then used to purchase U.S. Treasuries, and this practice turned\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET4China into the world’s largest holder of U.S. Treasuries. In 2005, however, China\nended its dollar peg and linked the value of the yuan to a basket of currencies and\nallowed it to ﬂuctuate within a narrow band that was reset every day. While the exact\npercentage of the basket is unknown, it is largely dominated by the U.S. dollar and\nincludes other currencies such as the euro, Japanese yen, South Korean won, British\npound, Thai baht, Russian ruble, and Australian, Canadian, and Singapore dollar.\nThrough the years China has gradually widened the band that the yuan can trade\nin, but if China were to end the ﬂoat and allow the RMB to trade freely on the\nglobal foreign exchange market, the impact on the ﬁxed-income markets would be\nsigniﬁcant because it would reduce the government’s need to purchase Treasuries\nand other ﬁxed-income securities. An announcement of this sort would send yields\nsoaring and prices tumbling. While it could be years before this happens, it will be\nimportant for bond investors to follow these developments if they want to effectively\nmanage the risk.\n■Comparing the FX Market with Futures\nand Equities\nThe foreign exchange market has not always been a popular market to trade because\nfor many decades, it was restricted to hedge funds, commodity trading advisers who\nmanage large amounts of capital, major corporations, and institutional investors\ndue to regulation, capital requirements, and technology. Yet it was the market\nof choice for many of these large players because the risk was fully customizable.\nTrader A could use a 50 times leverage, and Trader B could trade cash on cash.\nWhen the market opened up to retail traders, many brokerage ﬁrms swept in to\nprovide leveraged trading along with free instantaneous execution platforms, charts,\nand real-time news. This access to low-cost information helped foreign exchange\ntrading surge in popularity, increasing its attractiveness as an alternative asset class\nto trade.\nMany equity and futures traders also turned to currencies, adding the asset class\nto their trading portfolios. Before you choose to do so, however, it is important to\nunderstand some of the key difference s between the forex and equity markets.\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs, and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET5Characteristics of Equities Market\n1. There is decent market liquidity, but that can depend on a stock’s daily volume.\n2. The market is only available for trading 9:30am to 5pm NY Time, with limited\nafter-hours trading.\n3. The existence of exchange fees results in higher costs and commissions.\n4. There is an uptick rule to short stocks, which many day traders ﬁnd frustrating.\n5. The number of steps involved in completing a trade can increase slippage and\nerror.\nAs one of the most liquid markets in the world, the volume and liquidity present in\nthe FX markets has allowed traders to access a 24-hour market with low transaction\ncosts, high leverage, the ability to proﬁt in both bull and bear markets, minimized\nerror rates, limited slippage, and no trading curbs or uptick rules. Oftentimes, traders\ncan use the same strategies for analyzing the equity markets in the FX market. Funda-\nmental traders will ﬁnd that countries can be analyzed like stocks. Technical traders\nwill ﬁnd that the FX market is perfect for their style of analysis because of the abun-\ndance of tick data and because it is already one of the most commonly used analysis\ntools by professional traders. Now let’s take a closer look at the individual attributes\nof the FX market to really understand why this is such an attractive market to trade!\n24-Hour Market\nOne of the primary reasons why the FX market is popular is because for active\ntraders, it is the ideal market to trade. It’s 24-hour nature offers traders instant access\nto the markets at all hours of the day for immediate response to global developments.\nThis characteristic also gives traders the added ﬂexibility of determining their own\ntrading day. Active day traders no longer have to wait for the equities market to\nopen at 9:30am NY Time to begin trading. If there is a signiﬁcant announcement or\ndevelopment either domest ically or overseas bet ween 4pm NY Time and 9:30am\nNY Time, most day traders will have to wait for the exchanges to open at 9:30am\nto place trades. In all likelihood, by that time, unless you have access to electronic\ncommunication networks (ECNs) such as Instinet for premarket trading, the market\nwould have gapped up or gapped down against your favor. This is particularly\nfrustrating when important data are released at 8:30am NY Time, such as nonfarm\npayrolls. Professionals would have already priced in the outcome before the average\ntrader can even access to market.\nIn addition, many people who want to trade also have a full-time job during\nthe day. The ability to trade after hours makes the FX market a much more\nconvenient market for all traders. Different times of the day will offer different\ntrading opportunities, as the global ﬁnancial centers around the world are all actively\ninvolved in foreign exchange. With the FX m arket, trading after hours with a large\nonline FX broker provides the same liquidity and spread as any other time of day.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET6As a guideline, at 5pm Sunday NY Time, trading begins as the markets open in\nSydney, Australia. Then, the Tokyo markets open at 7 pm NY Time. Next, Singapore\nand Hong Kong open at 9pm NY Time followed by the European markets in Frankfurt\n(2am) and then London (3am). By 4am the European markets are in full swing, and\nAsia has concluded their trading day. The U.S. markets open ﬁrst in New York around\n8am Monday as Europe winds down. By 5pm, Sydney is set to reopen once again.\nThe majority of trading activity happens when the markets overlap; for example,\nAsia and Europe trading overlaps between 12am to approximately 2am, Europe and\nthe United States overlaps between 8a m to approximately 12pm NY Time, while\nthe United States and Asia overlap be tween 5pm and 9pm. During New York and\nLondon hours, all currency pairs trade actively. During the Asian hours, however,\nthe trading activity for pairs such as the GBPJPY and AUDJPY tend to peak.\nLower Transaction Costs\nLower transaction costs also makes forex an attractive asset class to trade. In the\nequity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission and with online\nequity brokers, commissions can run upwards of $20 per trade. This means that for\npositions of $100,000, average roundtrip commissions could be as high as $120.\nThe over the counter (OTC) structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which, in turn, lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Equity traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade for\nshort-term traders. For an active equity trader who typically places 30 trades a day,\nat $20 commission per trade, you would have to up to pay $600 in daily transaction\ncosts. This is a signiﬁcant amount of money that could take a large cut out of proﬁts\nor deepen losses. The reason why costs are so high is because there are a lot of\npeople involved in an equity transaction. More speciﬁcally, for each trade, there is\na broker, the exchange, and the specialist. All of these parties need to be paid, and\ntheir payment comes in the form of commission and clearing fees. In the FX market,\nbecause it is decentralized with no exchange or clearinghouse (everything is taken\ncare of by the market maker), these fees are not applicable.\nCustomizable Leverage\nEven though many people realize that higher leverage comes with risks, traders are\nhumans, and few of them ﬁnd it easy to turn away the opportunity to trade on\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET7someone else’s money. The FX market caters perfectly to these traders by offering\nthe highest leverage available for any market. Most online currency ﬁrms offer 50\ntimes leverage on regular-sized accounts and up to 200 times leverage on miniature\naccounts (abroad leverage can be as high as 400 times). Compare that to the 2 times\nleverage offered to the average equity investor and the 10 times capital that is\ntypically offered to the professional trader, and you can see why many traders have\nturned to the foreign exchange market. The margin deposit for leverage in the FX\nmarket is not seen as a down payment on a purchase of equity, as many perceive\nmargins to be in the stock markets. Rather, the margin is a performance bond, or\ngood-faith deposit, to ensure against trading losses. This is very useful to short-term\nday traders who need the enhancement in capital to generate quick returns. For the\nmore risk-averse investor, leverage is completely customizable, which means that\nif they only feel comfortable with 10 or 20 times leverage or no leverage at all,\nthey can elect to do so. It is extremely important to understand that leverage is a\ndouble-edged sword—it can magnify proﬁts but also losses.\nProﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nIn the FX market, proﬁt potentials exist in both bull and bear markets. Since\ncurrency trading always involves buying one currency and selling another, there\nis no structural bias to the market. Therefore, if you are long one currency, you\nare at the same time short another. As a result, equal proﬁt potential exists in\nboth upward-trending and downward-trending markets. This is different from the\nequities market, where most traders go long instead of short stocks, so the general\nequity investment community tends to suffer in a bear market.\nNo Trading Curbs or Uptick Rule\nThe FX market is the largest market in the world, forcing market makers to offer\nvery competitive prices. Unlike the equities market, there is never a time in the\nFX markets when trading curbs would take into effect and trading would be halted,\nonly to gap when reopened. This eliminates missed proﬁts due to archaic exchange\nregulations. In the FX market, traders would be able to place trades 24 hours a day\nwith virtually no disruptions.\nOne of the biggest annoyances for day trades in the equity market is the fact\nthat traders are prohibited from shorting a stock in a downtrend unless there is an\nuptick. This can be very frustrating as traders wait to join short sellers, but are only\nleft with continually watching the stock trend down before an uptick occurs. In the\nFX market, there is no such rule. If you want to short a currency pair, you can do\nso immediately; this allows for instant and efﬁcient execution.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET8Online Trading Reducing Error Rates\nA shorter trade process minimizes errors. Online currency trading is typically a\nthree-step process. A trader would place an order on the platform, the FX dealing\ndesk would automatically execute it electronically, and the order conﬁrmation\nwould be posted or logged onto the trader’s trading station. Typically, these three\nsteps would be completed in a matter of seconds. For an equities trade on the other\nhand, there is generally a ﬁve-step process. The client would call his broker to place\nan order, the broker sends the order to the exchange ﬂoor, the specialist on the\nﬂoor tries to match up orders (the broker competes with other brokers to get the\nbest ﬁll for the client), the specialist executes the trade, and the client receives a\nconﬁrmation from the broker. The elimination of a middleman minimizes the error\nrates in currency trades and increases the efﬁciency of each transaction.\nLimited Slippage\nUnlike the equity markets, many online FX market makers provide instantaneous\nexecution from real-time, two-way quotes. These quotes are the prices where the\nﬁrms are willing to buy or sell the quoted currency, rather than vague indications\nof where the market is trading, which may or may not be honored. Orders are\nexecuted and conﬁrmed within seconds. Robust systems would never request the\nsize of a trader’s potential order, or which side of the market he’s trading, before\ngiving him a bid/offer quote. Inefﬁcient dealers determine whether the investor is a\nbuyer or a seller, and shade the price to increase their own proﬁt on the transaction.\nThe equity market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’ system, under\nwhich you may not get executed at the price you wish, but rather at the next best\nprice available. For example, let’s say Microsoft is trading at $52.50. If you enter a\nbuy order at this rate, by the time it reaches the specialist on the exchange ﬂoor, the\nprice may have risen to $53.25. In this case, you will not get executed at $52.50;\nyou will get executed at $53.25, which is essentially a loss of 3∕4of a point. The\nprice transparency provided by the some of the better market makers assures that\ntraders always receive a fair price.\nPerfect Market for Technical Analysis\nFor technical analysts, currencies rarely spend much time in tight trading ranges and\nhave the tendency to develop strong trends. Over 80% of volume is speculative in\nnature and as a result, the market frequently overshoots and then corrects itself.\nHence, technical analysis works well for the FX market, and a technically trained\ntrader can easily identify new trends and breakouts, which provide multiple oppor-\ntunities to enter and exit positions. Charts and indicators are used by all professional\nFX market traders, and candle charts are available on most charting packages. In addi-\ntion, the most commonly used indicators such as Fibonacci retracements, stochastics,\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET9MACD, moving averages, RSI, and support/resistance levels have proven valid in\nmany instances.\nIn the USDJPY chart shown in Figure 1.1, it is clear that Fibonacci retracements,\nmoving averages, and stochastics have at one point or another given successful\ntrading signals. For example, the 61.8% retracement level served as resistance for\nUSDJPY in December 2014, January 2015, and February 2015. The moving-average\ncrossovers of the 10- and 20-day simple moving averages also successfully forecasted\nthe rally in USDJPY in late October, along with the decline in early January. Equity\ntraders who focus on technical analysis have the easiest transition, since they can\nimplement the same technical strategies that they use in the equities market into the\nFX market.\nAnalyze Stocks Like Countries\nTrading currencies is not a big challenge for fundamental traders either, because\ncountries can be analyzed like stocks. For example, if you analyze growth rates of\nstocks, you can use gross domestic product (GDP) to analyze the growth rate of\ncountries. If you analyze inventory and production ratios, you can follow industrial\nproduction (IP) or durable goods data. If you follow sales ﬁgures, you can analyze\nretail sales data. As with a stock investme n t ,i ti sb e t t e rt oi n v e s ti nt h ec u r r e n c yo fa\ncountry that is growing faster and fund it with a currency of a country that is growing\nslower. Currency prices reﬂect the balance of supply and demand for currencies.\nTwo of the primary factors affecting supply and demand of currencies are interest\nrates and the overall strength of the economy. Economic indicators such as GDP,\nforeign investment, and the trade balance reﬂect the general health of an economy\nand are therefore responsible for the underlying shifts in supply and demand for\nthat currency. There is a tremendous amount of data released at regular intervals,\nsome of which are more important than others. Data related to interest rates and\ninternational trade is the most closely followed.\nIf there is uncertainty regarding the direction of interest rates, any bit of news\non monetary policy can directly affect how the currency trades. Traditionally,\nif a country raises its interest rate, the currency of that country will strengthen\nin relation to other countries as investors shift assets to that country to gain a\nhigher return. In contrast, an interest rates hike is generally bad news for stocks\nbecause it means that borrowing costs have risen. In response, some investors will\ntransfer money out of a country’s stock market when interest rates are increased,\ncausing the country’s currency to weaken. Determining which effect dominates can\nbe tricky, but generally there is an advance consensus on how interest rates will\nmove. Indicators that have the biggest impact on interest rates are producer prices,\nconsumer prices, employment, spending, and GDP. Most of the time monetary\npolicy announcements are known in advance with meeting dates by the Bank of\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET10\nFIGURE 1.1 USDJPY Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET11England (BoE), the Federal Reserve (FED), European Central Bank (ECB), Bank\nof Japan (BoJ), and other central banks posted on their respective websites.\nAnother piece of data that can impact how currencies move is the trade balance,\nwhich shows the net differ ence over a period of time b etween a nation’s exports and\nimports. When a country imports more than it exports, the trade balance will show\na deﬁcit, which is generally considered unfavorable. For example, if U.S. dollars are\nsold for other domestic national currencies (to pay for imports), the ﬂow of dollars\noutside the country will depreciate the value of the dollar. Similarly, if trade ﬁgures\nshow an increase in exports, dollars will ﬂow into the United States and appreciate\nthe value of the dollar. From the standpoint of a national economy, a deﬁcit in and of\nitself is not necessarily a bad thing. If the deﬁcit is greater than market expectations\nhowever, it can trigger a negative price movement.\n■FX versus Futures\nTrading spot forex is also different from trading futures, and like equity traders,\nmany futures traders have also added currency spot trading into their portfolios. We\nknow that the spot forex market has the following attributes:\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nCharacteristics of Futures Markets\n1. There is limited market liquidity depending on the month of contract trades.\n2. The presence of exchange fees results in more costs and commissions.\n3. Market hours for futures trading are much shorter than spot and are dependent\non the product traded; each product may have different open and closing hours,\nand there is limited after-hours trading.\n4. Futures leverage is higher than equities, but still only a fraction of the leverage\noffered in FX.\n5. There tends to be prolonged bear markets.\n6. Pit trading structure increases error and slippage.\nLike in the equities market, traders can implement the same strategies they use\nin analyzing the futures markets in the FX m arket. Most future tr aders are technical\ntraders, and the FX market is perfect for technical analysis. In fact, it is the most\npopular analysis technique used by professional FX traders. Taking a closer look at\nhow the futures market stacks up, we see the following.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET12Comparing Market Hours and Liquidity\nThe volume traded in the FX market is estimated to be over ﬁve times that of the\nfutures market. The FX market is open for trading 24 hours a day, but the futures\nmarket has confusing market hours which vary based on the product traded. For\nexample, if you traded gold futures, it is only open for trading between 7:20am\nand 1:30pm on the COMEX. If you traded crude oil futures on the New York\nMercantile Exchange, t rading would only be ope n between 8:30am. and 2:10pm.\nThese varying hours not only create confusion but also makes it difﬁcult to act on\nbreakthrough announcements throughout the reminder of the day.\nIn addition, if you have a day job and can only trade after hours, futures would be\na very inconvenient market product to trade. You would basically be placing orders\nbased on past prices that are not current market prices. This lack of transparency\nmakes trading very cumbersome. In addition, each time zone has its own unique\nnews and developments that could move speciﬁc currency pairs, and with futures it\ncan difﬁcult to act on breaking overnight news.\nLow to Zero Transaction Costs\nIn the equity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission. With future\nbrokers, average commissions can run close to $160 per trade on positions of\n$100,000 or greater. The OTC structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which can in turn lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight,\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Futures traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow to zero transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade\nfor short-term traders. If you are an active futures trader who typically places 20\ntrades a day, at $100 commission per trade, you would have to pay $2,000 in daily\ntransaction costs. A typical futures trade involves a broker, a future commissions\nmerchant (FCM) order desk, a clerk on the exchange ﬂoor, a runner, and a pit\ntrader. All of these parties need to be paid, and their payment comes in the form of\ncommission and clearing fees, whereas the electronic nature of the market minimizes\nthese costs.\nNo Limit Up or Down Rules/Proﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nUnlike the tight restriction on the futures market, there is no limit down or limit\nup rule in the FX market. For example, on the S&P index futures, if the contract\nvalue falls more than 5% from the previous day’s close, limit down rules will come\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET13in effect, whereby on a 5% move, the index would only be allowed to trade at\nor above this level for the next 10 minutes. For a 20% decline, trading would be\ncompletely halted. Due to the decentralized nature of the FX market, there are no\nexchange-enforced restrictions on daily activity, which can help eliminate missed\nopportunities caused by archaic exchange regulations.\nExecution Quality and Speed/Low Error Rates\nThe futures market is also known for inconsistent execution, both in terms of pricing\nand execution time. Every futures trader has, at some point in time, experienced\na half hour or so wait for a market order to be ﬁlled, only to ﬁnd that the order\nhas been executed at a price far away from where the market was trading when\nthe initial order was placed. Even with electronic trading and limited guarantees of\nexecution speed, the price for ﬁlls on market orders is far from certain. The reason\nfor this inefﬁciency is the number of steps that are involved in placing a futures\ntrade. A futures trade is typically a seven-step process:\n1. The client calls his broker and places his trade (or places it online).\n2. The trading desk receives the order, processes it, and routes it to the FCM\norder desk on the exchange ﬂoor.\n3. The FCM order desk passes the order to the order clerk.\n4. The order clerk hands the order to a runner or signals it to the pit.\n5. The trading clerk goes to the pit to execute the trade.\n6. The trade conﬁrmation goes to the runner or is signaled to the order clerk and\nprocessed by the FCM order desk.\n7. The broker receives the trade conﬁrmation and passes it on to the client.\nAn FX trade in comparison is typically only a three-step process. A trader would\nplace an order on the platform, the FX dealing desk would automatically execute\nit electronically, and the order conﬁrmation would be posted or logged on the\ntrader’s trading station. The elimination of the involvement of these additional\nparties increases the speed of the trade execution and decreases errors.\nIn addition, the futures market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’\nsystem, under which your trades frequently do not get executed at the initial market\norder price, but rather, at the next best price available. For example, let’s say a\nclient is long 5 March Dow Jones futures contracts at 8800. If the client enters a\nstop order at 8700, when the rate reaches this level, the client will most likely be\nexecuted at 8690. This 10-point difference would be attributed to slippage, which\nis very common in the futures market.\nOn most FX trading stations, traders execute directly off of real-time streaming\nprices. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, there is generally no discrepancy\nbetween the displayed price and the execution price. This holds true even during\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET14volatile times and fast-moving markets. In the futures market, execution is uncertain\nbecause all orders must be done on the exchange. This creates a situation where\nliquidity is limited by the number of participants, which, in turn, limits quantities\nthat can be traded at a given price. Real-time streaming prices ensure that market\norders, stops, and limits are executed with minimal slippage and no partial ﬁlls.\n■W h oA r et h eP l a y e r si nt h eF XM a r k e t ?\nSince the foreign exchange market is an OTC market without a centralized exchange,\ncompetition between market makers prohibits monopolisti c pricing strategies. If\none market maker attempts to drastically skew the price, then traders simply have\nthe option to ﬁnd another market maker. Moreover, spreads are closely watched to\nensure market makers are not whimsically altering the cost of the trade. Many equity\nmarkets, on the other hand, operate in a completely different fashion; the New York\nStock Exchange, for instance, is the sole place where companies listed on the NYSE\ncan have their stocks traded. Centralized markets are operated by what are referred\nto as specialists. Market makers, on the other hand, is the term used in reference to\ndecentralized marketplaces. Since the NYSE is a centralized market, a stock traded\non the NYSE can only have one bid–ask quote at all times. Decentralized markets,\nsuch as foreign exchange, can have multiple market makers—all of whom have the\nright to quote different prices. Here is an illustration of how both centralized and\ndecentralized markets operate.\nCentralized Markets\nBy their very nature, centralized markets tend to be monopolistic: With a single\nspecialist controlling th e market, prices can easil y be skewed to a ccommodate the\ninterests of the specialist, not those of the traders (see Figure 1.2). If, for example,\nthe market is ﬁlled with sellers that the specialists must buy from but no prospective\nbuyers on the other side, the specialist may simply widen the spread, thereby\nBuyers\nCan buy only\nfrom one\nspecialistSpecialist\nUnites buyers and\nsellers; maintains\nsole control over\nthe spreadSellers\nCan sell only to\none specialist\nFIGURE 1.2 Centralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET15increasing the cost of the trade and preventing additional participants from entering\nthe market. Or, specialists can drastically alter the quotes they are offering, thus\nmanipulating the price to accommodate their own risk tolerance.\nHierarchy of Participants\nWhile the foreign exchange market is decentralized, and hence employs multiple\nmarket makers rather than a single specialist, participants in the FX market are\norganized into a hierarchy; those with superior credit access, volume transacted,\nand sophistication receive priority pricing in the market (see Figure 1.3). At the\ntop of the food chain is the interbank market, which trades the highest volume per\nday in relatively few currencies. In the interbank market, the largest banks can deal\nwith each other directly, via interbank brokers, or through electronic brokering\nsystems like EBS or Reuters. The interbank market is a credit-approved system,\nwhere banks trade based solely on the credit relationships they have established\nwith one another. The banks can see the rates everyone is dealing at, but each bank\nmust have a speciﬁc credit relationship with that bank in order to trade at the rates\nbeing offered. Other institutions such as online FX market makers, hedge funds,\nand corporations must trade FX through these banks, although some have created\ntheir own liquidity pools through the years. Many banks (e.g., small community\nbanks or banks in emerging markets), corporations, and institutional investors do\nnot have access to these rates because they have no established credit lines with\nbig banks. This forces smaller participants to deal through just one bank for their\nRetail Clients\nTrader\nTrader\nTrader\nTraderOnline TradingInterbank Market\nBank Bank\nBank BankEBS and\nReutersOnline FX\nMarket\nMakers\nFIGURE 1.3 Decentralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET16foreign exchange needs, and oftentimes this means much less competitive rates for\nthe participants further down the participant hierarchy. Those receiving the least\ncompetitive rates are customers of banks and physical currency exchange companies.\nRecently, technology has broken down the barriers that used to stand between the\nend-users of foreign exchange services and the interbank market. The online trading\nrevolution opened its doors to retail clientele by connecting market makers and\nmarket participants in an efﬁcient, low-cost manner. In essence, online trading\nplatforms serve as a gateway to the liquid FX market. Average traders can now\ntrade alongside the biggest banks in the world, with virtually similar pricing and\nexecution. What used to be a game dominated and controlled by the ‘‘big boys’’ is\nslowly becoming a level playing ﬁeld where individuals can proﬁt and take advantage\nof the same opportunities as big banks. FX is no longer an old boys club, which\nmeans opportunities abound for aspiring online currency traders.\nDealing Stations— Interbank Market\nFor serious traders who want to know more about the interbank market, the\nmajority of FX volume is actually transacted primarily through the interbank\nmarket. The leading banks of the world trade with each other electronically\nover two platforms—the EBS and Reuters, dealing 3000-spot matching. Both\nplatforms offer trading in the major currency pairs; however, certain currency\npairs are more liquid and generally more frequently traded over one versus the\nother. Some cross-currency pairs are traded over these platforms as well, but\nothers are calculated from the rates of the major currency pairs and are then offset\nusing the ‘‘legs.’’ For example, if an interbank trader had a client who wanted to\ngo long NZDCAD, the trader would most likely buy NZDUSD and USDCAD\nseparately. The trader would then multiply these rates and provide the client with\nthe respective NZDCAD rate, creating a synthetic quote and trade.\n17CHAPTER 2\nHistorical Events in\nthe FX Markets\nBefore learning how to trade currencies, it is important for every new and\nseasoned market participant to have some understanding about the most\nimportant historical events that have shaped the currency market. To this day, these\nevents are often referenced by professional traders.\n■Bretton Woods: Anointing the Dollar as the World\nCurrency (1944)\nIn July 1944, representatives of 44 nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire,\nto create a new institutional arrangement for governing the international economy\nin the years following World War II. Most agreed that international economic\ninstability was one of the principle causes of the war, and that such instability needed\nto be prevented in the future. The agreement, which was developed by renowned\neconomists John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White, was initially proposed\nto Great Britain as a part of the Lend Lease Act—an American act designed to assist\nGreat Britain in postwar redevelopment efforts. After various negotiations, the ﬁnal\nform of the Bretton Woods Agreement consisted of three key items:\n1. The formation of key international authorities designed to promote fair trade\nand international economic harmony\n2. The ﬁxation of exchange rates between currencies\n3. The convertibility between gold and t he U.S. dollar, thus empowering the U.S.\ndollar as the reserve currency of choice for the world\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS18Of these three parameters, only the ﬁrst is still in existence today, but the\norganizations formed as a direct result of Bretton Woods include the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT); and they all play a crucial role in modern day development and regulation\nof international economies. Since the demise of Bretton Woods, the IMF has\nworked closely with the World Bank. Toge ther, the two institutions now regularly\nlend funds to developing nations, assisting them in the development of a public\ninfrastructure capable of supporting a sound mercantile economy that can contribute\nin the international arena. In order to ensure that these nations can actually enjoy\nequal and legitimate access to trade with their industrialized counterparts, the World\nBank and IMF must work closely with GATT. While GATT was initially meant to\nbe a temporary organization, it now operates to encourage the dismantling of trade\nbarriers—namely, tariffs and quotas.\nThe Bretton Woods Agreement existed from 1944 to 1971, after which it\nwas replaced by the Smithsonian Agreement, an international contract pioneered\nby U.S. President Richard Nixon out the necessity to accommodate for Bretton\nWoods’ shortcomings. Unfortunately, the Smithsonian Agreement possessed the\nsame critical weakness: While it did not include gold/U.S. dollar convertibility,\nit maintained ﬁxed exchange rates—a facet that did not accommodate the United\nStates’ ongoing trade deﬁcit and the international need for a weaker U.S. dollar. As\na result, the Smithsonian Agreement was short-lived.\nUltimately, the exchange rates of t he world evolved into a free market,\nwhere supply and demand were the sole criteria that determined the value of a\ncurrency. While this did and still does result in a number of currency crises and\ngreater volatility between currencies, it also allowed the market to become self-\nregulating, and thus could dictate the appropriate value of a currency without any\nhindrances.\nAs for Bretton Woods, perhaps its most memorable contribution to the interna-\ntional economic arena was its role in changing the international perception about the\nU.S. dollar. While the euro is a revolutionary currency blazing new frontiers in both\nsocial behavior and international trade, the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve\ncurrency of choice. This is due, in large part, to the Bretton Woods Agreement:\nBy establishing dollar/gold convertibility, the dollar’s role as the world’s most\naccessible and reliable currency was ﬁrmly cemented. So while Bretton Woods\nmight be a doctrine of yesteryear, its impact on the U.S. dollar and international\neconomics still resonates today.\n■The End of Bretton Woods: Free Market\nCapitalism Is Born (1971)\nOn August 15, 1971, it became ofﬁcial: The Bretton-Woods system was abandoned\nonce and for all. While it had been exorcised before—only to subsequently emerge\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS19in a new form—this ﬁnal eradication of the Bretton Woods system was truly its\nlast stand: No longer would currencies be ﬁxed in value to gold, allowed only to\nﬂuctuate in a 1% range, but instead, their fair valuation could be determined by\nfree-market behavior such as trade ﬂows and foreign direct investment.\nAlthough U.S. President Nixon was conﬁdent that the end of the Bretton Woods\nsystem would bring about better times for the international economy, he was\nnot a believer that the free market could dictate a currency’s true valuation in a\nfair and catastrophe-free manner. Nixon and many well-respected economists at\nthe time reasoned that an entirely unstructured foreign exchange market would\nresult in competing devaluations, which, in turn, would lead to the breakdown of\ninternational trade and investment. The end result, Nixon and his board of economic\nadvisors argued, would be global depression.\nIn response, the Smithsonian Agreement was introduced a few months later.\nHailed by President Nixon as the ‘‘greatest monetary agreement in the history of\nthe world,’’ the Smithsonian Agreement strived to maintain ﬁxed exchange rates\nwithout the backing of gold. Its key difference from the Bretton Woods system was\nthat the value of the dollar could ﬂoat in a range of 2.25%, compared to just 1%\nunder Bretton Woods.\nUltimately, the Smithsonian Agreement proved to be unfeasible as well. Without\nexchange rates ﬁxed to gold, the free market gold price shot up to $215 per\nounce. Moreover, the U.S. trade deﬁcit continued to grow, and from a fundamental\nstandpoint, the U.S. dollar needed to be devalued beyond the 2.25% parameters\nestablished by the Smithsonian Agreement. In light of these problems, the foreign\nexchange markets were forced to close in February 1972.\nThe markets reopened in March 1973, and this time, they were not bound by a\nSmithsonian Agreement: The value of the US dollar was to be determined entirely\nby the market, as its value was not ﬁxed to any commodity, nor was its exchange rate\nﬂuctuation conﬁned to certain parameters. While this did provide the U.S. dollar,\nand other currencies by default, the agility required to adapt to a new and rapidly\nevolving international trading environment, it also set the stage for unprecedented\ninﬂation. The end of Bretton Woods and the Smithsonian Agreement, as well as\nconﬂicts in the Middle East, resulted in substantially higher oil prices and helped\nto create stagﬂation—the synthesis of unemployment and inﬂation—in the U.S.\neconomy. It would not be until later in the decade, when Federal Reserve Chairman\nPaul Volcker initiated new economic policies and President Reagan introduced a new\nﬁscal agenda, that the U.S. dollar would return to ‘‘normal’’ valuations. By then,\nthe foreign exchange markets had thoroughly developed and were capable of serving\na multitude of purposes. In addition to employing a laissez-faire style of regulation\non international trade, they also were beginning to attract speculators seeking to\nparticipate in a market with unrivaled liquidity and continued growth. Ultimately,\nthe death of Bretton Woods in 1971 marked the beginning of a new economic era, one\nthat liberated international trading while also proliferating speculative opportunities.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS20■Plaza Accord—Devaluation\nof the U.S. Dollar (1985)\nAfter the demise of all the various exchange rate regulatory mechanisms that\ncharacterized the twentieth century—t hat is, the Gold Standard, the Bretton\nWoods Standard, and the Smithsonian Agreement—the currency market was left\nwith virtually no regulation other than the mythical ‘‘invisible hand’’ of free\nmarket capitalism, one that supposedly strived to create economic balance through\nsupply and demand. Unfortunately, due to a number of unforeseen economic\nevents—such as the OPEC oil crises, stagﬂation throughout the 1970s, and drastic\nchanges in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ﬁscal policy—supply and demand, in and\nof themselves, became insufﬁcient means by which the currency markets could be\nregulated. A system of sorts was needed, but not one that was inﬂexible: Fixation of\ncurrency values to a commodity, such as gold, proved to be too rigid for economic\ndevelopment, as was also the notion of ﬁxing maximum exchange rate ﬂuctuations.\nThe balance between structure and rigidity was one that had plagued the currency\nmarkets throughout the twentieth century, and while advancements had been made,\na deﬁnitive solution was still greatly needed.\nHence, in 1985, the respective ministers of ﬁnance and central bank governors\nof the world’s leading economies—France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom,\nand the United States—convened in New York City, with the hopes of arranging a\ndiplomatic agreement that would work to optimize the economic effectiveness of\nthe foreign exchange markets. Meeting at the Plaza Hotel, the international leaders\ncame to the following agreements regarding speciﬁc economies and the international\neconomy as a whole:\n■Across the world, inﬂation was at very low levels. Contrary to the stagﬂation of\nthe 1970s—where inﬂation was high and real economic growth was low—the\nglobal economy in 1985 had done a complete 180, as inﬂation was now low and\ngrowth was strong.\n■While low inﬂation, even when coupled with robust economic growth, still\nallowed for low interest rates—a caveat that developing countries particularly\nenjoyed—there was an imminent danger of protectionist policies such as tariffs\nentering the economy. The United States was experiencing a large and growing\ncurrent account deﬁcit, while Japan and Germany were facing large and growing\nsurpluses. An imbalance so fundamental in nature could create serious economic\ndisequilibrium, which, in turn, would result in a distortion of the foreign exchange\nmarkets, and thus, the international economy as a whole.\n■The results of current account imbalances, and the protectionist policies that\nensued, required action. Ultimately, it was believed that the rapid acceleration\nin the value of the U.S. dollar, which appreciated more than 80% against the\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS21currencies of its major trading partners, was the primary culprit. The rising\nvalue of the U.S. dollar created enormous trade deﬁcits, hurting many different\neconomies.\nAt the meeting in the Plaza Hotel, the Uni ted States persuad ed other attending\ncountries to coordinate a multilateral intervention, and on September 22, 1985,\nthe Plaza Accord was implemented. This agreement was designed to allow for\na controlled decline of the dollar and the appreciation of the main anti-dollar\ncurrencies. Each country agreed to changes to their economic policies and to\nintervene in currency markets as necessary to weaken the value of the dollar. The\nUnited States agreed to cut its budget deﬁcit and lower interest rates. France, the\nUnited Kingdom, Germany, and Japan agreed to raise interest rates. Germany also\nagreed to tax cuts, while Japan agreed to let the value of the yen ‘‘fully reﬂect\nthe underlying strength of the Japanese economy.’’ However, one major problem\nwas that not every country adhered to their pledges made under the Plaza Accord.\nThe United States, in particular, did not follow through with its initial promise to\ncut the budget deﬁcit. Japan was severely hurt by the sharp rise in the yen, as its\nexporters were unable to remain competitive overseas, and it is argued that this\neventually triggered a 10-year recession in Japan. The United S tates, on the other\nhand, enjoyed considerable growth and price stability as a result of the agreement.\nThe effects of the multilateral intervention were seen immediately, and within\nless than two years, the dollar fell 46% and 50% against the German deutschemark\nand the Japanese yen, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.1.

This gradually resolved\nthe current account deﬁcits for the time being, and also ensured that protectionist\npolicies were minimal and nonthreatening. But perhaps most importantly, the\nPlaza Accord cemented the role of the central banks in regulating exchange rate\nmovement—yes, the rates would not be ﬁxed, and hence would be determined\nprimarily by supply and demand; but ultimately, such an invisible hand is insufﬁcient,\nand it was the right and responsibility of the world’s central banks to intervene on\nbehalf of the international economy when necessary.\n■George Soros—The Man Who Broke the Bank\nof England\nWhen George Soros placed a $10 billion speculative bet on the UK pound and\nwon, he became universally known as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England.’’\nWhether you love him or hate him, Soros led the charge in one of the most\nfascinating events in currency trading history. Here are the details.\nThe UK Joins the Exchange Rate Mechanism\nIn 1979, a Franco-German initiative set up the European Monetary System (EMS) to\nstabilize exchange rates, reduce inﬂation, and prepare for monetary integration. The\nExchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), one of the EMS’s main components, gave each\nparticipatory currency a central exchange rate against a basket of currencies, the\nEuropean Currency Unit (ECU). Participants (initially France, Germany, Italy, the\nNetherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and Luxemburg) were then required to\nmaintain their exchange rates within a 2.25% ﬂuctuation band above or below each\nbilateral central rate. The ERM was an adjustable-peg system, and nine realignments\nwould occur between 1979 and 1987. Whil e the United Kingdom was not one of\nthe original members, it would eventually join in 1990 at a rate of DM2.95 to the\npound and with a ﬂuctuation band of +/–6%.\nUntil mid-1992, the ERM appeared to be a success, as a disciplinary effect\nhad reduced inﬂation throughout Europe under the leadership of the German\nBundesbank. The stability wouldn’t last, however, as international investors started\nworrying that the exchange rate values of several currencies within the ERM\nwere inappropriate. Following German reuniﬁcation in 1989 government spending\nsurged, forcing the Bundesbank to print more money. This led to high inﬂation\nand left the German central bank with little choice but to increase interest rates.\nHowever, the rate hike came with consequences as it placed upward pressure on\nthe German mark. This forced other central banks to raise their interest rates as\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS23well as to maintain their pegged currency exchange rates (a direct application of\nIrving Fischer’s interest parity theory). Realizing that the UK’s weak economy and\nhigh unemployment rate would not permit the British government to maintain this\npolicy for long, George Soros stepped into action.\nSoros Bets Against the Success of UK Involvement in the ERM\nThe quantum hedge fund manager essentially wanted to bet that the pound would\ndepreciate because the United Kingdom would either devalue the pound or leave the\nERM. Thanks to the progressive removal of capital controls during the EMS years,\ninternational investors at the time had more freedom than ever to take advantage\nof perceived disequilibria, so Soros established short positions in pounds and long\npositions in marks by borrowing pounds and investing in mark-denominated assets.\nHe also made great use of options and futures. In all, his positions accounted for\na gargantuan $10 billion. Soros was not the only one; many other investors soon\nfollowed suit. Everyone was selling pounds, placing tremendous downward pressure\non the currency.\nAt ﬁrst, the Bank of England (BoE) tried to defend the pegged rates by buying\n15 billion pounds with its large reserve assets, but its sterilized interventions\n(whereby the monetary base is held constant thanks to open market interventions)\nwere limited in their effectiveness. The pound was trading dangerously close to the\nlower levels of its ﬁxed band. On September 16, 1992, a day that would later be\nknown as Black Wednesday, the bank announced a 2% rise in interest rates (from\n10% to 12%) in an attempt to boost the pound’s appeal. A few hours later, it\npromised to raise rates again to 15%, but international investors such as Soros could\nnot be swayed, knowing that huge proﬁts were right around the corner. Traders\nkept selling pounds in huge volumes, and the BoE kept buying them until, ﬁnally, at\n7:00 pm that same day, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced that Britain would\nleave the ERM and that rates would return to their initial level of 10%. The chaotic\nBlack Wednesday marked the beginning of a steep depreciation in the pound’s\neffective value.\nWhether the return to a ﬂoating currency was due to the Soros-led attack on\nthe pound or because of simple fundamental analysis is still debated today. What\nis certain, however, is that the pound’s depreciation of almost 15% against the\ndeutschemark and 25% against the dollar over the next ﬁve weeks as seen in Figure 2.2\nand Figure 2.3 resulted in tremendous proﬁts for Soros and others traders (the pound\nalso weakened by a similar proportion to the dollar). Within a month, the quantum\nfund cashed in on approximately $2 billion by selling the now more expensive\nDMs and buying back the now cheaper pounds. ‘‘The man who broke the Bank of\nEngland’’ showed how central banks can still be vulnerable to speculative attacks.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS243.00British Pound vs. Deutschemark (GBPDEM)\n2.90\n2.80\n2.70\n2.60\n2.50\n2.40\n2.30\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.2 GBPDEM after Soros\n2.10\n2.00\n1 .90\n1 .80\n1 .70\n1 .60\n1 .50\n1 .40British Pound Against US Dollar GBPUSD\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.3 GBPUSD after Soros\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS25■Asian Financial Crisis (1997–1998)\nFalling like a set of dominos on July 2, 1997, the relatively nascent Asian tiger\neconomies provide the perfect example of the interdependence in global capital\nmarkets and their subsequent effects throughout international currency forums.\nBased on several fundamental breakdowns, the cause of the ‘‘contagion’’ stemmed\nlargely from shrouded lending practices, inﬂated trade deﬁcits, and immature capital\nmarkets. Compiled, these factors contributed to a perfect storm that left major\nregional markets incapacitated and once-prized currencies devalued to signiﬁcantly\nlower levels. With adverse effects easily seen in the equities markets, currency\nmarket ﬂuctuations were negatively impacted in much the same manner during this\ntime period.\nThe Bubble\nLeading up to 1997, investors had become increasingly attracted to Asian investment\nprospects, focusing on real estate development and domestic equities. As a result,\nforeign investment capital ﬂowed into the region as economic growth rates climbed\non improved production in countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and\nKorea. Thailand, home of the baht, experienced a 6.5% growth rate in 1996, falling\nfrom 13% in 1988. Lending additional support for a stronger economy was the\nenactment of a ﬁxed currency peg to the U.S. dollar. With a ﬁxed valuation to\nthe greenback, countries like Thailand could ensure ﬁnancial stability in their own\nmarkets and a constant rate for export trading purposes with the world’s largest\neconomy. Ultimately, the region’s national currencies appreciated, as underlying\nfundamentals were justiﬁed and increased speculative positions of further climbs in\nprice mounted.\nBallooning Current Account Deﬁcits and Nonperforming Loans\nHowever, in early 1997, a shift in sentiment began to occur as international account\ndeﬁcits became increasingly difﬁcult for respective governments to handle and\nlending practices were revealed to be detrimental to the economic infrastructure. In\nparticular, economists were alerted to the fact that Thailand’s current account deﬁcit\nballooned in 1996 to $14.7 billion and had been climbing since 1992. Although\ncomparatively smaller than the U.S. deﬁcit, the gap represented 8% of the country’s\ngross domestic product. Shrouded lending practices also contributed heavily to\nthese breakdowns, as close personal relationships with high-ranking banking ofﬁcials\nwere well rewarded and surprisingly common throughout the region. In particular\nthis affected many of South Korea’s highly leveraged conglomerates as total\nnonperforming loan values skyrocketed to 7.5 percent of gross domestic product.\nAdditional evidence of these practices could be observed in ﬁnancial institutions\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS26throughout Japan. First announcing questionable and nonperforming loans of\n$136 billion in 1994, Japanese authorities admitted to an alarming $400 billion\ntotal a year later. Coupled with a then-crippled stock market, cooling real estate\nvalues, and dramatic slowdowns in the economy, investors saw opportunity in\na depreciating yen, subsequently adding selling pressure to neighbor currencies.\nWhen their own asset bubble collapsed, asset prices fell by $10 trillion, with\nthe fall in real estate prices accounting for nearly 65% of the total decline—the\nlosses were worth two years of national output. This fall in asset prices sparked\nthe banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early 1990s and then developed into a\nfull-blown, systemic crisis in 1997, following the failure of a number of high-proﬁle\nﬁnancial institutions. In response, Japanese monetary authorities issued rhetoric on\npotentially increasing benchmark interest rates in hopes of defending the domestic\ncurrency valuation. Unfortunately, these considerations never materialized and a\nshortfall ensued. Sparked mainly by an announcement of a managed ﬂoat of the Thai\nbaht, the slide snowballed as central bank reserves evaporated and currency price\nlevels became unsustainable in light of downside selling pressure.\nCurrency Crisis\nFollowing mass short speculation and attempted intervention, the aforementioned\nAsian economies were left ruined and momentarily incapacitated. The Thailand baht,\na once-prized possession, was devalued by as much as 48 percent, even slumping\ncloser to a 100% fall at the turn of the new year. The most adversely affected was\n01/01/97 02/01/97 03/01/97 04/01/97 05/01/97 06/01/97 07/01/97 08/01/97 09/01/97 10/01/97 11/01/97 12/01/97 01/01/98 02/01/98 03/01/98 04/01/9860\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0140001997–98 Asian Currency Fluctuations\n12000\n10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0Thailand Baht Indonesia Rupiah\nFIGURE 2.4 Asian Crisis Price Action\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS27150USDJPY During Asian Crisis\n145\n140\n135\n130\n125\n120\n115\n110\n105\n100\n5/3/19966/3/19967/3/19968/3/19969/3/199610/3/199611/3/199612/3/19961/3/19972/3/19973/3/19974/3/19975/3/19976/3/19977/3/19978/3/19979/3/199710/3/199711/3/199712/3/19971/3/19982/3/19983/3/19984/3/19985/3/19986/3/1998\nFIGURE 2.5 USDJPY Asian Crisis Price Action\nthe Indonesian rupiah. Also relatively stable prior to the onset of a ‘‘crawling peg’’\nwith the Thai baht, the rupiah fell a whopping 228%, worsening previously to a\nhigh of 12,950 to the ﬁxed U.S. dollar. These particularly volatile price actions are\nshown in Figure 2.4. Among the majors, the Japanese yen fell approximately 23%\nfrom its high to low against the U.S. do llar between 1997 and 1998, and after having\nretraced a signiﬁcant portion of its losses, ended the 8-month debacle down 15%,\na ss h o w ni nF i g u r e2 . 5 .\nLasting for less than a year, the ﬁnancial crisis of 1997 revealed the interconnec-\ntivity of economies and their effects in the global currency markets. Additionally, it\nshowed the inability of central banks to successfully intervene in currency valuations\nwith the absence of secure economic fundamentals and overwhelming market forces.\nToday, with the assistance of IMF reparation packages and the implementation of\nstricter requirements, Asia’s four little dragons are healthy once again. With inﬂa-\ntionary benchmarks and a revived exporting market, Southeast Asia is building back\nits once prominent stature among the world’s industrialized economic regions. With\nthe experience of evaporating currency reserves under their belt, the Asian tigers\nnow take active initiatives to ensure that there is large pot of reserves on hand in\ncase speculators attempt to attack their currencies once again.\n■Introduction of the Euro (1999)\nThe introduction of the euro was a monumental achievement, marking the largest\nmonetary changeover ever. The euro was ofﬁcially launched as an electronic trading\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS28currency on January 1, 1999. Euro notes and coins were put into circulation in 2002.\nThe 11 initial member states were: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy,\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, and Finland. As of 2015, there\nare 17 countries in the Eurozone. Each country ﬁxed its currency to a speciﬁc\nconversion rate against the euro, and a common monetary policy governed by the\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) was adopted. To many economists, the system would\nideally include all of the original 15 EU nations, but the United Kingdom, Sweden,\nand Denmark decided to keep their own currencies. In deciding whether to adopt\nthe euro, EU members have many important factors to consider.\nThe 1993 Maastricht Treaty sets out ﬁve main convergence criteria for member\nstates to participate in the European Monetary Union (EMU):\nMaastricht Treaty: C onvergence Criteria\n■The country’s government budget deﬁcit could not be greater than 3% of GDP.\n■The country’s government debt could not be larger than 60% of GDP.\n■The country’s exchange rate had to be maintained within ERM bands without any\nrealignment for two years prior to joining.\n■The country’s inﬂation rate could not be higher than 1.5% above the average\ninﬂation rate of the three EU countries with the lowest inﬂation rates.\n■The country’s long-term interest rate on government bonds could not be higher\nthan 2% above the average of the comparable rates in the three countries with the\nlowest inﬂation.\nAlthough the ease of traveling is one of the most attractive reasons to join the\neuro, being part of the monetary union provides other beneﬁts:\n■It eliminates exchange rate ﬂuctuations, providing a more stable environment to\ntrade within the euro area.\n■The purging of all exchange rate risk within the zone allows businesses to plan\ninvestment decisions with greater certainty.\n■Transaction costs also diminish, mainly those relating to foreign exchange\noperations, hedging operations, cross-border payments, and the management of\nseveral currency accounts.\n■Prices become more transparent as consumers and businesses can compare prices\nacross countries more easily, which, in turn, increases competition.\n■A huge single currency market becomes more attractive for foreign investors.\n■The economy’s magnitude and stability allow the ECB to control inﬂation with\nlower interest rates, thanks to increased credibility.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS\nk\nk29\nk\nk\nFIGURE 2.6 EURUSD Price Since Launch\nSource: eSignal\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS30Yet the euro is not without its limitations. Leaving aside political sovereignty\nissues, the main problem is that, by adopting the euro, a nation essentially forfeits\nany independent monetary policy. Since each country’s economy is not perfectly\ncorrelated to the EMU’s economy, a nation might ﬁnd the ECB hiking interest\nrates during a domestic recession. This can be particularly true for many of the\nsmaller nations. As a result, countries try to rely more heavily on ﬁscal policy, but\nthe efﬁciency of ﬁscal policy is limited when it is not effectively combined with\nmonetary policy. This inefﬁciency is further exacerbated by the 3% of GDP limit on\nbudget deﬁcits, as stipulated by the Stability and Growth Pact.\nSome concerns also subsist regarding the ECB’s effectiveness as a central bank.\nThe central bank strives for a 2% inﬂation target, but in the past 15 years, it strayed\naway from this level often. Also, from 1999 to late 2002, a lack of conﬁdence\nin the union’s currency (and in the union itself) led to a 24% depreciation, from\napproximately $1.15 to the euro in January 1999 to $0.88 in May 2000, forcing\nthe ECB to intervene in foreign exchange markets in the last few months of 2000.\nFigure 2.6 shows a daily chart of the euro since it was launched in 1999.\nSince 2000, things have greatly changed, with the euro trading at a premium to\nthe dollar, but quantitative easing in 2014 put the currency back in a downtrend\nversus the dollar. Some analysts claim that the euro will one day replace the dollar\nas the world’s dominant international currency, and while we believe it will have a\ngreater share in reserve portfolios, we doubt that this will be likely.\n31CHAPTER 3\nWhat Moves the\nCurrency Market?\nNow that we know a little bit about the history of the forex market, let’s take a\nlook at what moves currencies. There are two primary ways to analyze ﬁnancial\nmarkets: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis is rooted\nin understanding underlying economic conditions, while technical analysis uses\nhistorical prices to predict future movements. For as long as technical analysis\nhas been around, there has been an ongoing debate as to which methodology\nis more successful. Short-term traders prefer to use technical analysis, focusing\ntheir strategies primarily on price action, while medium-term traders tend to use\nfundamental analysis to determine a currency’s current and future valuation.\nBefore implementing successful trading strategies, it is important to understand\nwhat drives the movements of currencies in the foreign exchange market. The\nbest strategies tend to be the ones that combine both fundamental and technical\nanalysis. Textbook perfect technical formations have failed too often because of\nmajor fundamental news and events like U.S. nonfarm payrolls. But trading on\nfundamentals alone can also be risky. There will oftentimes be sharp gyrations in\nthe price of currency on a day when there are no news or economic reports. This\nsuggests that the price action is driven by nothing more than ﬂows, sentiment, and\npattern formations. Therefore, it is very important for technical traders to be aware\nof the key economic data or events that are scheduled for release, and, in turn,\nfor fundamental traders to be aware of important technical levels that the general\nmarket may be focusing on.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?32■Fundamental Analysis\nFundamental analysis focuses on the economic, social, and political forces that drive\nsupply and demand. Those using fundamental analysis as a trading tool look at\nvarious macroeconomic indicators such as growth rates, interest rates, inﬂation,\nand unemployment. We outlined some of the most important economic releases\nin the ﬁrst chapter of this book. Fundamental analysts will combine all of this\ninformation to assess current and future performance. This requires a lot of work\nand thorough analysis, as there is no single set of beliefs that guides fundamental\nanalysis. Traders employing fundamental analysis need to continually keep abreast\nof news and announcements, as they can indicate potential changes to the economic,\nsocial, and political environment. All traders should be aware of the broad economic\nconditions before placing trades. This is especially important for day traders who\nare trying to make trading decisions based on news events because even though\nFederal Reserve Monetary Policy decisions are always important, if the rate move is\ncompletely priced into the market, then the actual reaction in the EURUSD could\nbe nominal.\nTaking a step back, currencies move primarily based on supply and demand.\nThat is, on the most fundamental level, a currency rallies because there is demand\nfor that currency. Regardless of whether the demand is for hedging, speculative,\nor conversion purposes, true movements are based on the need for the currency.\nCurrency values decrease when there is excess supply. Supply and demand should be\nthe real determinants for predicting future movements. However, how to predict\nsupply and demand is not as simple as many would think. There are many factors\nthat contribute to the net supply and demand for a currency. This includes capital\nﬂows, trade ﬂows, speculative, and hedging needs.\nFor example, the U.S. dollar was very strong (against the euro) between 1999\nand the end of 2001. This rally was driven primarily by the dot-com boom and the\ndesire by foreign investors to participate in these elevated returns. This demand\nfor U.S. assets required foreign investors to sell their local currencies and purchase\nU.S. dollars. Since the end of 2001, geopolitical uncertainty arose, the United States\nstarted cutting interest rates, and foreign investors started to sell U.S. assets in\nsearch of higher yields elsewhere. This required foreign investors to sell U.S. dollars,\nincreasing supply and lowering the dollar’s value against other major currency pairs.\nThe availability of funding or interest in buying a currency is a major factor that can\nimpact the direction that a currency trades. It was one of the primary drivers of the\nU.S. dollar between 2002 and 2005, making foreign ofﬁcial purchases of U.S. assets\n(also known as the Treasury International Capital Flow, or TIC data) an important\neconomic indicator.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?33Capital and Trade Flows\nCapital ﬂows and trade ﬂows constitute a country’s balance of payments, which\nquantiﬁes the amount of demand for a currency over a given period of time.\nTheoretically, a balance of payments equal to zero is required for a currency to\nmaintain its current valuation. A negative balance of payments number, on the other\nhand, indicates that capital is leaving the economy at a more rapid rate than it is\nentering, and hence, it should fall in value.\nThis is particularly important in current conditions (at the time of this book’s\npublication), where the United States is running a consistently large trade deﬁcit\nwithout sufﬁcient foreign inﬂow to fund that deﬁcit. As a result of this very problem,\nthe trade-weighted dollar index fell 22% in value between 2003 and 2005. The\nJapanese yen is another good example. As one of the world’s largest exporters, Japan\nruns a very high trade surplus. Therefore, despite a zero interest rate policy that\nprevents capital ﬂows from increasing, the yen has a natural tendency to trade lower\nbased on trade ﬂows, which is the other side of the equation. To be more speciﬁc,\nfollowing is a more detailed explanation of what capital and trade ﬂows encompass.\nCapital Flows\nCapital ﬂows measure the net amount of a currency that is being purchased or sold\ndue to capital investments. A positive capital ﬂow balance implies that foreign inﬂows\nof physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed outﬂows. A negative\ncapital ﬂow balance indicates that there are more physical or portfolio investments\nbought by domestic investors than foreign investors. There are generally two types\nof capital ﬂows—physical ﬂows and portfolio ﬂows (which are further segmented\ninto equity markets and ﬁxed-income markets).\nPhysical Flows\nPhysical ﬂows encompass actual foreign direct investments by corporations such as\ninvestments in real estate, manufacturing, and local acquisitions. All of these require\nthat a foreign corporation sell its local currency and buy the foreign currency, which\nleads to movements in the FX market. This is particularly important for global\nmergers and corporate acquisitions that involve more cash than stock.\nPhysical ﬂows are important to watch, as they represent the underlying changes\nin actual physical investment activity. These ﬂows shift in response to changes in\neach country’s ﬁnancial health and growth opportunities. Changes in local laws that\nencourage foreign investment also serve to promote physical ﬂows. For example,\ndue to China’s entry into the WTO, its foreign investment laws have been relaxed.\nAs a result of China’s cheap labor and attractive revenue opportunities (population\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?34of over 1 billion), corporations globally have ﬂooded China with investments. From\nan FX perspective, in order to fund investments in China, foreign corporations need\nto sell their local currency and buy Chinese renminbi (RMB).\nPortfolio Flows in Equity Markets\nAs technology has enabled greater ease with respect to transportation of capital,\ninvesting in global equity markets has become far more feasible. Accordingly, a\nrallying stock market in any part of the world serves as an ideal opportunity for all,\nregardless of geographic location. The result of this has become a strong correlation\nbetween a country’s equity markets and its currency: If the equity market is rising,\ninvestment dollars generally come in to seize the opportunity. Alternatively, falling\nequity markets could prompt domestic investors to sell their shares of local publicly\ntraded ﬁrms to take advantage of investment opportunities abroad.\nThe attraction of equity markets over ﬁxed-income markets has increased across\nthe years. Since the early 1990s, the ratio of foreign transactions in U.S. government\nbonds over U.S. equities has declined from 10 to 1 to 2 to 1. As indicated in\nFigure 3.1, it is evident that the Dow had a high correlation (of approximately 81%)\nwith the U.S. dollar (against the EUR) between 1994 and 1999. In addition, from\n1991–1999, the Dow increased 300%, while the USD index appreciated nearly 30%\nfor the same time period. As a result, currency traders closely followed the global\nequity markets to predict short and intermediate term equity-based capital ﬂows.\nHowever, this relationship shifted after the tech bubble burst in the United States as\n1/31/9412500 1. 15\n1. 10\n1 .05\n1 .00\n0.95\n0.90\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n0.70\n0.6511500\n10500\n9500\n8500\n7500\n6500\n5500\n4500\n3500\n6/30/94 11/30/94 4/28/95 9/29/95 2/29/96 7/31/96 12/31/96Dow Jones and USDEUR\n5/30/97 10/31/97 3/31/98 8/31/98 1/29/99 6/30/99 11/30/99INDU Index Px Last USDEUR Curncy\nFIGURE 3.1 Dow and USDEUR\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?35foreign investors remained relatively risk averse causing a lower correlation between\nthe performance of the U.S. equity market and the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, a\nrelationship still exists, making it important for all traders to keep an eye on global\nmarket performances in search of intermarket opportunities.\nPortfolio Flows in Fixed-Income Markets\nJust as the equity market is correlated to exchange rate movement, so too is the\nﬁxed-income market. In times of global uncertainty, ﬁxed-income investments can\nbecome particularly appealing, due to the inherent safety they possess. As a result,\neconomies boasting the most valuable ﬁxed-income opportunities will be capable of\nattracting foreign investment—which will naturally ﬁrst require the purchasing of\nthe country’s respective currency.\nA good gauge of ﬁxed-income capital ﬂows are the short- and long-term yields of\ninternational government bonds. It is important to monitor the spread differential\nbetween the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the yield on foreign bonds because\ninternational investors tend to move money from one country to another in search\nof the highest yielding assets. When U.S. assets have one of the highest yields,\nthis encourages more investments in U.S. ﬁnancial instruments, hence beneﬁting\nthe U.S. dollar. When the United States has the lowest yields, this discourages\ninvestments. Investors can also use short-term yields, such as the spreads on 2-year\ngovernment bonds, to gauge the short-term ﬂow of international funds. Aside from\ngovernment bond yields, Fed fund futures can also be used to estimate movement\nof U.S. funds, as they price in the expectation of future Fed interest rate policy.\nEuribor futures are a barometer for the Euro region’s expected future interest rates\nand can give an indication of EU future policy movements. We will discuss how to\nuse ﬁxed-income products to trade FX further in our strategy section.\nTrade Flows: Measuring Exports versus Imports\nTrade ﬂows are the basis of all international transactions. Just as the investment\nenvironment of a given economy is a key driver of its currency valuation, trade ﬂows\nrepresent a country’s net trade balance. Countries that are net exporters—meaning\nthey sell more goods abroad than they buy—will experience a net trade surplus.\nCountries that are net exporters are more likely to have their currency rise in value\nbecause from the perspective of international trade, their currency is being bought\nmore than it is sold. This impacts currency ﬂows because international clients buying\nthe exported product/service must ﬁrst buy the currency of the exporting nation.\nCountries who are net importers purchase more goods abroad than they sell,\ncreating a trade deﬁcit. These nations will generally see more downward than\nupward pressure on their currencies because in order to purchase these foreign\ngoods, importers must sell their own currency and purchase the currency of the\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?36country from which they are buying the good or service. This accordingly drives\ndown the value of the currency when all else is equal. This concept is important\nbecause it is one of primary reasons why many economists say that certain currencies\nneed to fall to reverse burgeoning trade deﬁcits.\nTo understand this further, let’s imagine that the UK economy is booming,\nand its stock market is performing well. Meanwhile, in the United States, a\nlackluster economy is creating a shortage of investment opportunities. In this type\nof environment U.S. investors will feel more inclined to sell their U.S. dollars and\nbuy British pounds to participate in the outperformance of the UK economy. When\nthey elect to do so, it results in the outﬂow of capital from the United States and\nthe inﬂow of capital into the United Kingdom. From an exchange rate perspective,\nthis would induce a fall in the USD coupled with a rise in the GBP, as demand for\nUSD declines and the demand for GBP increases, translating into strength for the\nGBP/USD currency pair.\nEven day and swing traders will ﬁnd it valuable to keep up with incoming\neconomic reports from the major economies.\nTrading Tip: Charting Economic Surprises\nOne way for traders to stay on top of economic trends is to chart economic data\nsurprises against price action. Figure 3.2 illustrates how this can be done. The chart\ngraphs how much an economic indicator has deviated from its consensus forecast,\nor the ‘‘surprise,’’ and stacks them on the same side and graphs price (blue line)\naction when the data was release against the surprise, with a simple regression line\n(white line). This can be done for all of the major currency pairs and provides a\nvisual guide to understanding whether price action has been in line with economic\nfundamentals and can be used as a guide to future price action. Economic data can\nbe found on the calendars of any major forex website, and price action can generally\nbe downloaded from your trading platforms.\nAccording to Figure 3.2, in November of 2004, there were 14 out of 15 positive\neconomic surprises and yet the dollar sold off against the euro during the month\nof December, which was the month in which the economic data were released.\nAlthough this methodology is not exact, the analysis is simple and past charts\nhave yielded some extremely useful clues to future price action. Figure 3.3 shows\nhow the EURUSD moved the following month. As you can see, the EURUSD\nquickly corrected itself during the month of January, indicating that the fundamental\ndivergence from price action that occurred in December proved to be quite useful\nto dollar longs, which harvested almost 600 pips as the euro quickly retracted a large\npart of its gains in January. This method of analysis, called variant perception, was ﬁrst\ninvented by the legendary hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, who produced\n24% average rates return for 30 consecutive years.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?37US Dollar Data and EURUSD\n1 .3700\n1 .3600\n1 .3500\n1 .3400\n1 .3300\n1 .3200\n1. 3 10 0\n1 .3000\n–100%–26.11%0.00%0.00%1.41%1.46%2.56%2.81%3.55%4.18%14.29%16.67%33.33%43.48%50.25%140.00%\n–50% 0% 50%Durable Goods\nEmpire State Manufacturing\nPhilly Fed\nLeading Economic Indicators\nPersonal Income\nIndustrial Production\nISM Non-Manufacturing\nCurrent Account\nExisting Home Sales\nGDP Annualized\nU.

Large positive and negative\nsurprises in economic data can often yield clues to future price action. If you go back\nand look at the EURUSD charts, you will see that the record current account deﬁcits\nin October 2004 were the catalyst that sent the dollar plunging over the next two\nmonths. In many ways, economic fundamentals matter more in the foreign exchange\nmarket than in any other market, and charts such as these could provide valuable\nclues to price direction. Generally, the 15 most important economic indices are\nchosen from each region, and then a price regression line is superimposed over the\npast 20 days of price data.\n■Technical Analysis\nPrior to the mid-1980s, fundamental traders dominated the FX market. However,\nwith the rising popularity of technical analysis and the advent of new technologies,\nthe inﬂuence of technical trading on the FX market has increased signiﬁcantly. The\navailability of high leverage also led to an increased number of high frequency and\nmomentum. They have become active participants in the FX market, with the acute\nability to inﬂuence currency prices.\nUnlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses on the study of price\nmovements. Technical analysts use historical currency data to forecast the direction\nof future prices. The underlying belief behind technical analysis is that all current\nmarket information is already reﬂected in the price of that currency; therefore,\nstudying price action is all that is required to make informed trading decisions. In a\nnutshell, technical analysis assumes that history will repeat itself.\nTechnical analysis is an extremely popular tool used by short- and medium-term\ntraders for analyzing the forex market. It works especially well in the currency\nmarkets because short-term currency price ﬂuctuations are primarily driven by\nhuman emotions or market perceptions. The primary tool in technical analysis\nis price and charts. Traders will look for trends and patterns to identify trading\nopportunities. The most basic concept of technical analysis is that markets have a\ntendency to trend. Being able to identify trends in their earliest stage of development\nis the key to technical analysis. Range trading is also very popular, and similar tools\ncan be used to identify these setups. Technical analysis integrates price action and\nmomentum to construct a pictorial representation of past currency price action and\nto use this information to predict future performance. Technical analysis tools such\nas Fibonacci retracement levels, moving averages, oscillators, candlestick charts, and\nBollinger bands provide further information on the value of the emotional extremes\nof buyers and sellers. It also helps to gauge when greed and fear are the strongest.\nThere are basically two types of markets, trending or range bound, and in the trade\nparameters section, we outline some rules that can help traders determine the type\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?39of market they trading in right now and the sort of trading opportunities they should\nbe looking for.\nIs Technical Analysis or Fundamental Analysis Better?\nNo one will ever win the age-long battle between technical and fundamental analysis.\nHowever, most individual traders will start trading with technical analysis because\nit is easier to understand and does not require hours of study. Technical analysts can\nalso follow many currencies and markets at one time, whereas fundamental analysts\ntend to focus on a few pairs due to the overwhelming amount of data in the market.\nNonetheless, technical analysis works well because the currency market tends to\ndevelop strong trends. Once technical analysis is mastered, it can be applied with\nequal ease to any time frame or currency traded.\nHowever, it is important to take both strategies into consideration, as fundamental\nanalysis can trigger technical movements such as breakouts or reversal in trends.\nTechnical analysis, on the other hand, can also explain moves that fundamentals\ncannot, especially in quiet markets, causing resistance in trends or unexplainable\nmovements. For example, as shown in Figure 3.4, in the days leading up to\nSeptember 11, USDJPY had just broken out of a triangle formation and looked\npoised to head higher. However, as the chart indicates, instead of breaking higher as\ntechnicians may have anticipated, USDJPY broke down following the September 11,\n2001, terrorist attacks and ended up hitting a low of 115.81 from a high of 121.88\non September 10.\n■Currency Forecasting—What Bookworms\nand Economists Look At\nFor more avid students of foreign exchange who want to learn more about\nfundamental analysis and valuing currencies, this section examines the different\nmodels of currency forecasting used by analysts of the major investment banks.\nThere are seven major models for forecasting currencies, which include the balance\nof payments theory, purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, the monetary\nmodel, the real interest rate differential model, the asset market model, and the\ncurrency substitution model.\nBalance of Payments Theory\nThe balance of payments theory states that exchange rates should be at their\nequilibrium level, which is the rate that produces a stable current account balance.\nCountries with trade deﬁcits experience a run on their foreign exchange reserves\ndue to the fact that exporters to that nation must sell that nation’s currency in order\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?k\nk40k\nk\nFIGURE 3.4 USDJPY September 11th Chart\nSource: eSignal\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?41to receive payment. The cheaper currency makes the nation’s exports less expensive\nabroad, which in turn fuels exports and brings the currency into balance.\nWhat Is the Balance of Payments (BOP)?\nThe balance of payments account is divided into two parts: the current account and\nthe capital account. The current account measures trade in tangible, visible items\nsuch as cars and manufactured goods; the trade balance is the surplus or deﬁcit\nbetween exports and imports. The capital account measures ﬂows of money, such\nas investments for stocks or bonds. Balance of payments data can be found on the\nwebsite of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nTrade Flows\nThe trade balance of a country shows the net difference over a period of time\nbetween a nation’s exports and imports. When a country imports more than it\nexports, the trade balance is negative or is in a deﬁcit. If the country exports more\nthan it imports, the trade balance is positive or is in a surplus. The trade balance\nreﬂects the redistribution of wealth among countries and is a major channel through\nwhich the macroeconomic policies of a country may affect another.\nIn general, if a country has a trade deﬁcit, it is considered to be unfavorable, since\nit negatively impacts the value of the nation’s currency. For example, if U.S. trade\nﬁgures show greater imports than exports, more dollars ﬂow out of the United\nStates and the value of the U.S. currency depreciates. A positive trade balance,\nin comparison, will affect the dollar by causing it to appreciate against the other\ncurrencies.\nCapital Flows\nIn addition to trade ﬂows, there are also capital ﬂows that occur among countries.\nThey record a nation’s incoming and outgoing investment ﬂows, such as payments\nfor entire or parts of companies, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, real estate, and\nfactories. Capital ﬂows are inﬂuenced by many factors, including the ﬁnancial and\neconomic climate of other countries, and can be in the form of physical or portfolio\ninvestments. In general, in developing countries, the composition of capital ﬂows\ntends to be skewed toward foreign direct investment (FDI) and bank loans. For\ndeveloped countries, due to the strength of the equity and ﬁxed-income markets,\nstocks and bonds appear to be more important than bank loans and FDI.\nEquity Markets\nEquity markets have a signiﬁcant impact on exchange rate movements because\nthey are a major place for high-volume currency movements. Their importance is\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?42considerable for the currencies of countries with developed capital markets, where\na great amount of capital inﬂows and outﬂows occur, and where foreign investors\nare major participants. The amount of the foreign investment ﬂows in the equity\nmarkets is dependent on the general health and growth of the market, reﬂecting\nthe well-being of companies and particular sectors. Movements of currencies occur\nwhen foreign investors move their money to a particular equity market. Thus,\nthey convert their capital in a domestic currency and push the demand for it\nhigher, making the currency appreciate. When the equity markets are experiencing\nrecessions, however, foreign investors tend to ﬂee, thus converting back to their\nhome currency and pushing the domestic currency down.\nFixed-Income (Bond) Markets\nThe effect that ﬁxed-income markets have on currencies is similar to that of the\nequity markets and is a result of capital movements. An investor’s interest in the\nﬁxed-income market depends on the company’s speciﬁcs and credit rating, as well as\non the general health of the economy and the country’s interest rates. The movement\nof foreign capital into and out of ﬁxed-income markets leads to change in the demand\nand supply for currencies, hence impacting the currencies’ exchange rates.\nSummary of Trade and Capital Flows\nDetermining and understanding a country’s balance of payments is perhaps the\nmost important and useful tool for those interested in fundamental analysis. Any\ninternational transaction gives rise to two offsetting entries: trade ﬂow balance\n(current account) and capital ﬂow balance (capital account). If the trade ﬂow balance\nis a negative outﬂow, the country is buying more from foreigners than it sells\n(imports exceed exports). When it is a positive inﬂow, the country is selling more\nthan it buys (exports exceed imports). The capital ﬂow balance is positive when\nforeign inﬂows of physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed that\ncountry’s outﬂows. A capital ﬂow is negative when a country buys more physical or\nportfolio investments than are sold to foreign investors.\nThese two entries, trade and capital ﬂow, when added together signify a country’s\nbalance of payments. In theory, the two entries should balance and add up to zero\nin order to provide for the maintenance of the status quo in a nation’s economy and\ncurrency rates.\nIn general, countries might experience positive or negative trade, as well as\npositive or negative capital ﬂow balances. In order to minimize the net effect of\nthe two on the exchange rates, a country should try to maintain a balance between\nthe two. For example, in the United States, there is a substantial trade deﬁcit, as\nmore is imported than is exported. When the trade balance is negative, the country\nis buying more from foreigners than it sells, and therefore it needs to ﬁnance its\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?43deﬁcit. This negative trade ﬂow might be offset by a positive capital ﬂow into the\ncountry, as foreigners buy either physical or portfolio investments. Therefore, the\nUnited States seeks to minimize its trade deﬁcit and maximize its capital inﬂows,\nwith hopes that the two will balance out.\nA change in this balance is extremely signiﬁcant and carries ramiﬁcations that\nrun deep into economic policy and currency exchange levels. The net result of the\ndifference between the trade and capital ﬂows, positive or negative, will impact the\ndirection in which the nation’s currency will move. If the overall trade and capital\nbalance is negative, it will result in a depreciation of the nation’s currency, and if\npositive, it will lead to an appreciation of the currency.\nClearly, a change in the balance of payments carries a direct effect for currency\nlevels. It is therefore possible for any investor to observe economic data relating to\nthis balance and interpret the results that will occur. Data relating to capital and\ntrade ﬂows should be followed most closely. For instance, if an analyst observes\nan increase in the U.S. trade deﬁcit and a decrease in the capital ﬂows, a balance\nof payments deﬁcit would occur, and as a result, an investor may anticipate a\ndepreciation of the dollar.\nLimitations of BOP Model\nThe BOP model mainly focuses on traded goods and services, while ignoring\ninternational capital ﬂows. Indeed, international capital ﬂows often dwarfed trade\nﬂows in the currency markets toward the end of the 1990s, and this oftentimes\nbalanced out the current account of debtor nations like the United States.\nFor example, in 1999, 2000, and 2001, the United States maintained a large\ncurrent account deﬁcit while the Japanese ran a large current account surplus.\nHowever, during this same period in time the U.S. dollar rose against the yen even\nthough trade ﬂows were running against the dollar. The reason was that capital ﬂows\nbalanced out trade ﬂows, thus defying the BOP’s forecasting model for a period of\ntime. Indeed, the increase in capital ﬂows has given rise to the asset market model .\nNote: It is probably a misnomer to call this theory the balance of payments theory\nsince it only takes into account the current account balance, not the actual balance\nof payments. However, until the 1990s capital ﬂows played a very small role in the\nworld economy, so the main statistic viewed was the trade balance, which made up\nthe bulk of the balance of payments for most nations.\nPurchasing Power Parity\nThepurchasing power parity (PPP) theory is based on the belief that foreign exchange\nrates should be determined by the relative prices of a similar basket of goods between\ntwo countries. Any change in a nation’s inﬂation rate should be balanced by an\nopposite change in that nation’s exchange rate. Therefore, according to this theory,\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?44when a country’s prices are rising due to inﬂation, that country’s exchange rate\nshould depreciate in order to return to parity.\nPPP’s Basket of Goods\nThe basket of goods and services priced for the PPP exercise is a sample of all goods\nand services covered by GDP. It includes consumer goods and services, government\nservices, equipment goods, and construction projects. More speciﬁcally, consumer\nitems include food, beverages, tobacco, clothing, footwear, rents, water supply,\ngas, electricity, medical goods and services, furniture and furnishings, household\nappliances, personal transport equipment, fuel, transport services, recreational\nequipment, recreational and cultural services, telephone services, education services,\ngoods and services for personal care and household operation, and repair and\nmaintenance services.\nBig Mac Index\nOne of the most well-known examples of PPP is The Economist ’s Big Mac Index. The\nBig Mac PPP calculates the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the\nsame in America as elsewhere. Comparing these with actual rates helps to signal if\na currency is under- or overvalued. As described by The Economist, the index is a\nlightheartedly guide to currency valuation. It was never intended as a precise gauge\nof currency misalignment, but merely a tool to make exchange-rate theory more\ndigestible.\nFor example, in January 2015, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and\nChinese yuan was approximately 6.20. At the time, a Big Mac cost $4.79 in the\nUnited States. In China, the same burger cost 17.15 yuan, or approximately $2.77\nat market exchange. This means that based on the comparison between the two\nburger prices, the Chinese yuan was undervalued by 42%.\nOECD Purchasing Power Parity Index\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) releases a\nmore formal index. Under a joint OECD-Eurostat PPP Program, the OECD and\nEurostat share the responsibility for calculating PPPs. Their latest information on\nwhich currencies are under- or overvalued against the U.S. dollar can be found\non the OECD website at www.oecd.org. The OECD publishes a table that shows\nthe price levels for the major industrialized countries. Each column shows the\nnumber of speciﬁed monetary units needed in each of the countries listed to buy\nthe same representative basket of consumer goods and services. In each case,\nthe representative basket costs a hundred units in the country whose currency is\nspeciﬁed. The chart that is then created compares the PPP of a currency with its\nactual exchange rate. The chart is updated weekly to reﬂect the current exchange\nrate. It is also updated about twice a year to reﬂect new estimates of PPP. The\nPPP estimates are taken from studies carried out by the OECD; however, it should\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?45not be taken as deﬁnitive. Different methods of calculation will arrive at different\nPPP rates.\nAccording to the OECD’s data as of April 17, 2015, the PPP value of the\nAustralian dollar versus the U.S. dollar based on GDP is 0.6712. At the time, the\nAUD/USD exchange rate was 0.7812. Using this model of valuation, this indicates\nthat the Australian dollar was 14% overvalued.\nLimitations to Using Purchasing Power Parity\nPPP theory should only be used for long-term fundamental analysis. While the\neconomic forces behind PPP will eventually equalize the purchasing power of\ncurrencies, this can take many years. A time horizon of 5–10 years is typical.\nPPP’s major weakness is that it assumes goods can be traded easily, without regard\nto such things as tariffs, quotas, or taxes. For example, when the U.S. government\nannounces new tariffs on imported steel, the cost of domestic manufactured goods\ngoes up; but those increases will not be reﬂected in the U.S. PPP tables.\nThere are other factors that must also be considered when weighing PPP: inﬂation,\ninterest rate differentials, economic releases/reports, asset markets, trade ﬂows,\nand political developments. Indeed, PPP is just one of several theories traders should\nuse when determining exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Parity\nThe interest rate parity theory states that if two different currencies have different\ninterest rates, then that difference should be reﬂected in the premium or discount\nfor the forward exchange rate to prevent riskless arbitrage.\nFor example, if U.S. interest rates are 3% and Japanese interest rates are 1%,\nthen the U.S. dollar should depreciate against the Japanese yen by 2% in order\nto prevent riskless arbitrage. This future exchange rate is reﬂected in the forward\nexchange rate stated today. In our example, the forward exchange rate of the dollar\nis said to be at discount because it buys fewer Japanese yen in the forward rate than\nit does in the spot rate. The yen is said to be at a premium.\nInterest rate parity has shown very little proof of effectiveness in recent years.\nOftentimes, currencies with higher interest rates rise and attract incoming invest-\nment, while currencies with low and falling interest rates decline as outﬂows slow.\nThe Monetary Model\nAccording to the monetary model, exchange rates are determined by a nation’s\nmonetary policy. The premise is that countries that follow a stable monetary policy\nover time should have appreciating currencies. Countries that have erratic monetary\npolicies or excessively expansionist policies should see the value of their currency\ndepreciate.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?46How to Use the Monetary Model\nThree factors inﬂuence exchange rates under this theory:\n1. A nation’s money supply\n2. Expected future levels of a nation’s money supply\n3. The growth rate of a nation’s money supply\nAll of these factors are key to understanding and spotting a monetary trend that\nmay force a change in exchange rates. For example, let’s assume that the Japanese\neconomy has been slipping in and out of recession for over a decade. Interest rates\nare near zero and annual budget deﬁcits prevent the Japanese from spending their\nway out of recession, which leaves only one tool left at the disposal of Japanese\nofﬁcials determined to revive Japan’s economy: printing more money. By buying\nstocks and bonds, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is increasing the nation’s money supply,\nwhich produces inﬂation, and this forces a change in the exchange rate. The example\nin Figure 3.5 illustrates the effect of money supply changes to the Japanese yen using\nthe monetary model.\nIndeed, it is in the area of excessive expansionary monetary policy that the\nmonetary model is most successful. One of the only ways a country can keep\nits currency from sharply devaluing is by pursuing a tight monetary policy. For\nexample, during the Asian Currency Crisis, the Hong Kong dollar came under\nattack from speculators. Hong Kong ofﬁcials raised interest rates to 300% to halt\nthe Hong Kong dollar from being dislodged from its peg to the U.S. dollar. The\ntactic worked perfectly, as speculators were cleared out by such sky-high interest\nrates. The downside was that the Hong Kong economy would slide into recession.\nBut in the end, the peg held and the monetary model worked.\nLimitations of the Monetary Model\nVery few economists rely solely on this model because it does not take into account\ntrade ﬂows and capital ﬂows. For example, throughout 2014 Australia had higher\ninterest rates, growth rates, and inﬂation rates than both the United States and the\nEuropean Union, yet, the AUD appreciated in value against both the dollar and the\neuro. Indeed, the monetary model has greatly struggled since the dawn of freely\nCHANGE IN MONEY\nSUPPL Y\nY en Is Printed Increase in Y en Creates\nInflationY en Depreciates in ValueCHANGE IN EXCHANGE\nRATECHANGE IN PRICE\nLEVEL\nFIGURE 3.5 Monetary Model\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?47ﬂoating currencies. The model holds that high interest rates signal growing inﬂation,\nwhich it often does, followed by a depreciating currency. But this does not take into\naccount the capital inﬂows that would take effect as a result of higher interest yields\nor of an equity market that may be thriving in a booming economy—thus causing\nthe currency to possibly appreciate.\nIn any case, the monetary model is one of several valuation tools that can be\nemployed in tandem with other models to determine the direction an exchange rate\nis heading.\nReal Interest Rate Differential Model\nAccording to the real interest rate differential theory, exchange rate movements are\ndetermined by a country’s interest rate. The idea is that countries with high interest\nrates should see their currency appreciate in value, while countries with low interest\nrates should see their currency depreciate in value.\nBasics of the Model\nThe basic premise of the model is that when a country raises its interest rates,\ninternational investors will buy that currency because they ﬁnd its yield more\nattractive. When a country lowers interest rates, they sell the currency. Figure 3.6\nUK\nUKInterest Rates vs. United States Eurozone\nEurozone2003 Percent.

The Australian dollar had the\nlargest basis point spread and also had the highest return against the U.S. dollar,\nwhich seems to vindicate the model, as investors bought up higher-yielding Aussie.\nThe same can be said for the New Zealand dollar, which also had a higher yield\nthan the U.S. dollar and gained 27% against USD. Yet the model becomes less\nconvincing when comparing the euro, which gained 20% against the dollar (more\nthan every currency except NZD), even though its basis point differential was\nonly 100 points. The model then comes under serious question when comparing\nthe British pound and the Japanese yen. The yen differential is –100, and yet it\nappreciated almost 12% against the dollar. Meanwhile, the British pound gained\nonly 11% against the dollar even though it had a whopping 275 point interest rate\ndifferential.\nThis model also stresses that one of the key factors in determining the severity of\nan exchange rate’s response to a shift in interest rates is the expected persistence of\nthat shift. Simply put, a rise in interest rates that is expected to last for ﬁve years\nwill have a much larger impact on the exchange rate than if that rise were expected\nto last for only one year.\nLimitations to the Interest Rate Model\nThere is a great deal of debate among international economists over whether there\nis a strong and statistically signiﬁcant link between changes in a nation’s interest rate\nand currency price. The main weakness of this model is that it does not take into\naccount a nation’s current account balance, relying on capital ﬂows instead. Indeed,\nthe model tends to overemphasize capital ﬂows at the expense of numerous other\nfactors, such as political stability, inﬂation, and poor economic growth. Absent these\ntypes of factors, the model can be very useful, since it is quite logical to conclude\nthat an investor will naturally gravitate toward the investment vehicle that pays a\nhigher reward.\nThe Asset Market Model\nThe basic premise of the asset market model theory is that the ﬂow of funds into the\nﬁnancial assets of a country such as equities and bonds increases the demand for that\ncountry’s currency (and vice versa). As proof, advocates point out that the amount\nof funds that are placed in investment products such as stocks and bonds now dwarf\nthe amount of funds that is exchanged as a result of the transactions in goods and\nservices for import and export purposes. The asset market theory is basically the\nopposite of the balance of payments theory since it takes into account a nation’s\ncapital account instead of its current account.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?49A Dollar-Driven Theory\nThroughout 1999, many experts argued that the dollar would fall against the euro\non the grounds of the expanding U.S. current account deﬁcit and an overvalued\nWall Street. That was based on the rationale that non-U.S. investors would begin\nwithdrawing their funds from U.S. stocks and bonds into more economically sound\nmarkets, which would weigh signiﬁcantly on the dollar. Yet, such fears have lingered\nsince the early 1980s when the U.S. current account soared to a record high 3.5%\nof GDP.\nIn the two decades that followed, the balance of payments approach in assessing\nthe dollar’s behavior has given way to the asset market approach. This theory\ncontinues to hold the most sway over pundits due to the enormity of U.S. capital\nmarkets. In May and June of 2002, the dollar plummeted over 1000 points versus\nthe yen at the same time equity investors ﬂed U.S. equity markets due to the\naccounting scandals that were plaguing Wall Street. As the scandals subsided toward\nthe end of 2002, the dollar rose 500 points from a low of 115.43 to close at 120.00\nagainst the yen, even though the current account balance remained in massive deﬁcit\nthe entire time.\nLimitations to the Asset Market Theory\nIt is frequently argued that over the long run, there is no relationship between\na nation’s equity market performance and the performance of its currency. See\nFigure 3.7 for a comparison. Between April 2014 and April 2015, the German DAX\nand EURUSD have a very weak correlation.\nAlso, what happens to a nation’s currency when the stock market is trading\nsideways—stuck between bullish and bearish sentiments? That was the scenario in\n6/11/14 7/11/14 8/11/14 9/11/1410/11/14 11/11/14 12/11/141/11/15 2/11/15 3/11/15 4/11/15 5/11/15 6/11/15EURUSD and DAX\n13000\n12500\n12000\n11500\n11000\n10500\n10000\n9500\n9000\n80001.4\n1.35\n1.3\n1.2\n11.051.11.151.25\n8500\nEURUSD BGN Curncy (R1) DAX  INDEX (R2)\nFIGURE 3.7 The DAX Index and the EURUSD\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?50Germany for much of 2014, and currency traders found themselves going back to\nolder money making models, such as interest rate arbitrage, as a result. Only time\nwill tell whether the asset market model will hold up or merely be a short-term blip\non the currency forecasting radar.\nThe Currency Substitution Model\nThe currency substitution model is an enhanced version of the monetary model\nbecause it takes into account investor ﬂows. It posits that the shifting of private\nand public portfolios from one nation to another can have a signiﬁcant effect on\nexchange rates. The ability of individuals to change their assets from domestic and\nforeign currencies is known as currency substitution. When this model is added\nto the monetary model, evidence shows that shifts in expectations of a nation’s\nmoney supply can have a decided impact on that nation’s exchange rates. Simply\nput, investors are looking at monetary model data and coming to the conclusion\nthat a change in money ﬂow is about to occur, thus affecting the exchange rate, so\nthey are investing accordingly, which turns the monetary model into a self-fulﬁlling\nprophecy. Investors who subscribe to this theory are merely jumping on the currency\nsubstitution model bandwagon on the way to the monetary model party.\nThe Yen Example\nIn the monetary model we talked about how the Japanese government was basically\nprinting yen and increasing the money supply when it bought stocks and bonds.\nMonetary model theorists would say that this monetary growth would spark inﬂation\n(more yen chasing fewer products), decrease demand for the yen, and ﬁnally cause\nthe yen to depreciate. A currency substitution theorist would agree with this scenario\nand look to take advantage of this view by shorting the yen, or if they were long\nthe yen promptly getting out of the position. By taking this action, our yen trader\nis helping to drive the market precisely in that direction, thus making the monetary\nmodel theory a fate accompli. The step-by-step process is illustrated in Figure 3.8.\nA. Japan announces new stock and bond buyback plan. Economists are now\npredicting Japan’s money supply will dramatically increase.\nB. Economists are also predicting a rise in inﬂation with the introduction of this\nnew policy. Speculators expect a change in the exchange rate as a result.\nC. Economists expect interest rates to rise and inﬂation takes hold in the economy.\nSpeculators start selling short the yen in anticipation of a change in the exchange\nrate.\nD. Demand for the yen plummets as money ﬂows easily through the Japanese\neconomy and speculators dump yen in the markets.\nE. The exchange rate for the Japanese yen changes dramatically as the yen falls\nin value to foreign currencies, especially those that are easily substituted by\ninvestors (read: liquid yen crosses).\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?51Forecast of\nFuture\nMonetary\nGrowth Forecast of\nFuture InflationChange in\nExchange RateChange in Real\nMoney Demand\nChange in\nExpected\nExchange RateChange in\nDemand for\nForeign Cash\nAB CD EForecast of\nFuture Inflation\nFIGURE 3.8 Currency Substitution Model\nLimitations of the Currency Substitution Model\nAmong the major, actively traded currencies, this model has not yet shown itself\nto be a convincing, single determinant for exchange rate movements. While this\ntheory can be used with more conﬁdence in underdeveloped countries where ‘‘hot\nmoney’’ rushes in and out of emerging markets with enormous effect, there are\nstill too many variables not accounted for by the currency substitution model. For\nexample, using the yen illustration in Figure 3.8, even though Japan may try to spark\ninﬂation with its securities’ buyback plan, it still has an enormous current account\nsurplus that will continually prop up the yen. Also, Japan has numerous political\nlandmines it must avoid in its own neighborhood, and should Japan make it clear\nthat it is trying to devalue its currency, there will be enormous repercussions. These\nare just two of many factors the substitution model does not take into consideration.\nHowever, this model (like numerous other currency models) should be considered\npart of an overall, balanced, FX forecasting diet.",

Traditionally, it is the platform through which governments, businesses,\ninvestors, travelers, and other interested parties convert or ‘‘exchange’’ currency.\nAt its most fundamental level, the foreign exchange market is an over-the-counter\n(OTC) market with no central exchange and clearing house where orders are\nmatched. FX dealers and market makers around the world are linked to each other\naround-the-clock via telephone, computer, and fax, creating one cohesive market.\nThrough the years, this has changed with many institutions offering exchange traded\nFX instruments, but all of the prices are still derived from the underlying or spot\nforex market.\nIn the past two decades, foreign exchange, also known as forex orFX,became\navailable to trade by individual retail investors, and this access caused the market\nto explode in popularity. In the early 2000s, the Bank of International Settlements\nreported a 57% increase in volume between Ap ril 2001 and 2004. At the time more\nthan $1.9 trillion were changing hands on a daily basis. After the ﬁnancial crisis in\n2008, the pace of growth eased to a still- respectable 32% between 2010 and 2013,\nbut the actual volume that changed hands was signiﬁcantly larger at an average of\n$5.3 trillion per day. To put this into perspective, it is 50 times greater than the\ndaily trading volume of the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ combined.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET2While the growth of the retail foreign exchange market contributed to this surge\nin volume, an increase in volatility over the past few years also made investors\nmore aware of how currency movements can impact the equity and bond markets.\nIf stocks, bonds, and commodity traders want to make more educated trading\ndecisions, it is important for them to also follow forex movements. What follows\nare some of the examples of how currency ﬂuctuations impacted stock and bond\nmarket movements in past years.\n■EURUSD and Corporate Proﬁtability\nFor stock market traders, particularly those who invest in European corporations that\nexport a tremendous amount of goods to the United States, monitoring exchange\nrates are essential to predicting earnings and corporate proﬁtability. Throughout 2003\nand 2004, European manufacturers complained extensively about the rapid rise in the\neuro and the weakness in the U.S. dollar. The main culprit for the dollar’s selloff at\nthe time was the country’s rapidly growing trade and budget deﬁcits. This caused the\nEURUSD exchange rate to surge, which took a signiﬁcant toll on the proﬁtability of\nEuropean corporations because a higher exchange rate makes the goods of European\nexporters more expensive to U.S. consumers. In 2003, inadequate hedging shaved\napproximately EUR$1 billion euros from Volkswagen’s proﬁts, while DSM, a Dutch\nchemicals group, warned that a 1% move in the EURUSD rate would reduce proﬁts\nby EUR$7 million to EUR$11 million. Unfortunately, inadequate hedging is still a\nreality in Europe, which makes monitoring the EURUSD exchange rate even more\nimportant in forecasting the earnings and proﬁtability of European exporters.\n■Nikkei and U.S. Dollar\nTraders exposed to Japanese equities also need to be aware of the developments\nthat are occurring in the U.S. dollar and ho w that affects the Nikkei rally. Japan\nrecently came out of 10 years of stagnation. During this time, mutual funds and\nhedge funds were grossly underweight Japanese equities. When the economy began\nto turn around, global macro funds rushed to make changes to their portfolios in fear\nof missing out on a great opportunity to take advantage of Japan’s recovery. Hedge\nfunds borrowed signiﬁcant amount of dollars to pay for increased exposure, but the\nproblem was that their borrowings were very sensitive to U.S. interest rates and the\nFed’s monetary policy tightening cycle. Increased borrowing costs forthe dollar could\nderail the Nikkei’s rally because higher rates will raise the dollar’s ﬁnancing costs. Yet\nwith the huge current account deﬁcit, the Fed might need to continue raising rates\nto increase the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Therefore, continual\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET3rate hikes, coupled with slowing growth in Japan, may make it less proﬁtable for\nfunds to be overleveraged and overly exposed to Japanese stocks. As a result, how\nthe U.S. dollar moves also plays a role on the future direction of the Nikkei.\n■George Soros\nKnown as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England,’’ George Soros is one of\nthe most well-known traders in the FX market. We discuss his adventures in\nmore detail in Chapter 2, but in a nutshell, in 1990, England decided to join\nthe Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) system because it wanted to take part in\nthe stable and low-inﬂation environment created by the Bundesbank, the central\nbank of Germany. This alliance tied the pound to the deutschmark, which meant\nthat the United Kingdom was subject to the monetary policies enforced by the\nBundesbank. In the early 1990s, Germany aggressively increased interest rates to\navoid the inﬂationary effects related to German reuniﬁcation. However, national\npride and the commitment of ﬁxing exchange rates within the ERM prevented\nEngland from devaluing the pound. On Wednesday, September 16, also known as\nBlack Wednesday, George Soros leveraged the entire value of his fund ($1 billion) and\nsold $10 billion worth of pounds to bet against the ERM. This essentially ‘‘broke’’\nthe Bank of England and forced it to devalue the pound. In a matter of 24 hours, the\nBritish pound fell approximately 5%, or 5000 pips. The Bank of England promised\nto raise rates in order to tempt speculators to buy pounds. As a result, this caused\ntremendous volatility in the bond markets, with 1-month UK LIBOR rates rising\n1% and then retracing those gains over the next 24 hours. If bond traders were\ncompleted oblivious to what was going on in the currency markets, they would have\nprobably found themselves dumbstruck in face of such rapid gyration in yields.\n■Chinese Yuan Revaluation and Bonds\nFor Treasury traders, there’s another currency-related issue that is important to\nfollow and that is the gradual revaluation of the Chinese yuan. For most of its history,\nthe yuan or renminbi (RMB) was pegged to the U.S. dollar. In the 1980s, the RMB\nwas devalued to promote growth in C hina’s economy, and between 1997 and 2005\nthe People’s Bank of China artiﬁcially maintained a USDRMB rate of 8.27. At the\ntime, it received signiﬁcant criticism because keeping the peg meant that the Chinese\ngovernment would artiﬁcially weaken its currency to make Chinese goods more\ncompetitive. To maintain the band, the Chinese government had to sell the yuan and\nbuy U.S. dollars each time their currency appreciated above the band’s upper limit.\nThese dollars were then used to purchase U.S. Treasuries, and this practice turned\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET4China into the world’s largest holder of U.S. Treasuries. In 2005, however, China\nended its dollar peg and linked the value of the yuan to a basket of currencies and\nallowed it to ﬂuctuate within a narrow band that was reset every day. While the exact\npercentage of the basket is unknown, it is largely dominated by the U.S. dollar and\nincludes other currencies such as the euro, Japanese yen, South Korean won, British\npound, Thai baht, Russian ruble, and Australian, Canadian, and Singapore dollar.\nThrough the years China has gradually widened the band that the yuan can trade\nin, but if China were to end the ﬂoat and allow the RMB to trade freely on the\nglobal foreign exchange market, the impact on the ﬁxed-income markets would be\nsigniﬁcant because it would reduce the government’s need to purchase Treasuries\nand other ﬁxed-income securities. An announcement of this sort would send yields\nsoaring and prices tumbling. While it could be years before this happens, it will be\nimportant for bond investors to follow these developments if they want to effectively\nmanage the risk.\n■Comparing the FX Market with Futures\nand Equities\nThe foreign exchange market has not always been a popular market to trade because\nfor many decades, it was restricted to hedge funds, commodity trading advisers who\nmanage large amounts of capital, major corporations, and institutional investors\ndue to regulation, capital requirements, and technology. Yet it was the market\nof choice for many of these large players because the risk was fully customizable.\nTrader A could use a 50 times leverage, and Trader B could trade cash on cash.\nWhen the market opened up to retail traders, many brokerage ﬁrms swept in to\nprovide leveraged trading along with free instantaneous execution platforms, charts,\nand real-time news. This access to low-cost information helped foreign exchange\ntrading surge in popularity, increasing its attractiveness as an alternative asset class\nto trade.\nMany equity and futures traders also turned to currencies, adding the asset class\nto their trading portfolios. Before you choose to do so, however, it is important to\nunderstand some of the key difference s between the forex and equity markets.\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs, and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET5Characteristics of Equities Market\n1. There is decent market liquidity, but that can depend on a stock’s daily volume.\n2. The market is only available for trading 9:30am to 5pm NY Time, with limited\nafter-hours trading.\n3. The existence of exchange fees results in higher costs and commissions.\n4. There is an uptick rule to short stocks, which many day traders ﬁnd frustrating.\n5. The number of steps involved in completing a trade can increase slippage and\nerror.\nAs one of the most liquid markets in the world, the volume and liquidity present in\nthe FX markets has allowed traders to access a 24-hour market with low transaction\ncosts, high leverage, the ability to proﬁt in both bull and bear markets, minimized\nerror rates, limited slippage, and no trading curbs or uptick rules. Oftentimes, traders\ncan use the same strategies for analyzing the equity markets in the FX market. Funda-\nmental traders will ﬁnd that countries can be analyzed like stocks. Technical traders\nwill ﬁnd that the FX market is perfect for their style of analysis because of the abun-\ndance of tick data and because it is already one of the most commonly used analysis\ntools by professional traders. Now let’s take a closer look at the individual attributes\nof the FX market to really understand why this is such an attractive market to trade!\n24-Hour Market\nOne of the primary reasons why the FX market is popular is because for active\ntraders, it is the ideal market to trade. It’s 24-hour nature offers traders instant access\nto the markets at all hours of the day for immediate response to global developments.\nThis characteristic also gives traders the added ﬂexibility of determining their own\ntrading day. Active day traders no longer have to wait for the equities market to\nopen at 9:30am NY Time to begin trading. If there is a signiﬁcant announcement or\ndevelopment either domest ically or overseas bet ween 4pm NY Time and 9:30am\nNY Time, most day traders will have to wait for the exchanges to open at 9:30am\nto place trades. In all likelihood, by that time, unless you have access to electronic\ncommunication networks (ECNs) such as Instinet for premarket trading, the market\nwould have gapped up or gapped down against your favor. This is particularly\nfrustrating when important data are released at 8:30am NY Time, such as nonfarm\npayrolls. Professionals would have already priced in the outcome before the average\ntrader can even access to market.\nIn addition, many people who want to trade also have a full-time job during\nthe day. The ability to trade after hours makes the FX market a much more\nconvenient market for all traders. Different times of the day will offer different\ntrading opportunities, as the global ﬁnancial centers around the world are all actively\ninvolved in foreign exchange. With the FX m arket, trading after hours with a large\nonline FX broker provides the same liquidity and spread as any other time of day.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET6As a guideline, at 5pm Sunday NY Time, trading begins as the markets open in\nSydney, Australia. Then, the Tokyo markets open at 7 pm NY Time. Next, Singapore\nand Hong Kong open at 9pm NY Time followed by the European markets in Frankfurt\n(2am) and then London (3am). By 4am the European markets are in full swing, and\nAsia has concluded their trading day. The U.S. markets open ﬁrst in New York around\n8am Monday as Europe winds down. By 5pm, Sydney is set to reopen once again.\nThe majority of trading activity happens when the markets overlap; for example,\nAsia and Europe trading overlaps between 12am to approximately 2am, Europe and\nthe United States overlaps between 8a m to approximately 12pm NY Time, while\nthe United States and Asia overlap be tween 5pm and 9pm. During New York and\nLondon hours, all currency pairs trade actively. During the Asian hours, however,\nthe trading activity for pairs such as the GBPJPY and AUDJPY tend to peak.\nLower Transaction Costs\nLower transaction costs also makes forex an attractive asset class to trade. In the\nequity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission and with online\nequity brokers, commissions can run upwards of $20 per trade. This means that for\npositions of $100,000, average roundtrip commissions could be as high as $120.\nThe over the counter (OTC) structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which, in turn, lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Equity traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade for\nshort-term traders. For an active equity trader who typically places 30 trades a day,\nat $20 commission per trade, you would have to up to pay $600 in daily transaction\ncosts. This is a signiﬁcant amount of money that could take a large cut out of proﬁts\nor deepen losses. The reason why costs are so high is because there are a lot of\npeople involved in an equity transaction. More speciﬁcally, for each trade, there is\na broker, the exchange, and the specialist. All of these parties need to be paid, and\ntheir payment comes in the form of commission and clearing fees. In the FX market,\nbecause it is decentralized with no exchange or clearinghouse (everything is taken\ncare of by the market maker), these fees are not applicable.\nCustomizable Leverage\nEven though many people realize that higher leverage comes with risks, traders are\nhumans, and few of them ﬁnd it easy to turn away the opportunity to trade on\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET7someone else’s money. The FX market caters perfectly to these traders by offering\nthe highest leverage available for any market. Most online currency ﬁrms offer 50\ntimes leverage on regular-sized accounts and up to 200 times leverage on miniature\naccounts (abroad leverage can be as high as 400 times). Compare that to the 2 times\nleverage offered to the average equity investor and the 10 times capital that is\ntypically offered to the professional trader, and you can see why many traders have\nturned to the foreign exchange market. The margin deposit for leverage in the FX\nmarket is not seen as a down payment on a purchase of equity, as many perceive\nmargins to be in the stock markets. Rather, the margin is a performance bond, or\ngood-faith deposit, to ensure against trading losses. This is very useful to short-term\nday traders who need the enhancement in capital to generate quick returns. For the\nmore risk-averse investor, leverage is completely customizable, which means that\nif they only feel comfortable with 10 or 20 times leverage or no leverage at all,\nthey can elect to do so. It is extremely important to understand that leverage is a\ndouble-edged sword—it can magnify proﬁts but also losses.\nProﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nIn the FX market, proﬁt potentials exist in both bull and bear markets. Since\ncurrency trading always involves buying one currency and selling another, there\nis no structural bias to the market. Therefore, if you are long one currency, you\nare at the same time short another. As a result, equal proﬁt potential exists in\nboth upward-trending and downward-trending markets. This is different from the\nequities market, where most traders go long instead of short stocks, so the general\nequity investment community tends to suffer in a bear market.\nNo Trading Curbs or Uptick Rule\nThe FX market is the largest market in the world, forcing market makers to offer\nvery competitive prices. Unlike the equities market, there is never a time in the\nFX markets when trading curbs would take into effect and trading would be halted,\nonly to gap when reopened. This eliminates missed proﬁts due to archaic exchange\nregulations. In the FX market, traders would be able to place trades 24 hours a day\nwith virtually no disruptions.\nOne of the biggest annoyances for day trades in the equity market is the fact\nthat traders are prohibited from shorting a stock in a downtrend unless there is an\nuptick. This can be very frustrating as traders wait to join short sellers, but are only\nleft with continually watching the stock trend down before an uptick occurs. In the\nFX market, there is no such rule. If you want to short a currency pair, you can do\nso immediately; this allows for instant and efﬁcient execution.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET8Online Trading Reducing Error Rates\nA shorter trade process minimizes errors. Online currency trading is typically a\nthree-step process. A trader would place an order on the platform, the FX dealing\ndesk would automatically execute it electronically, and the order conﬁrmation\nwould be posted or logged onto the trader’s trading station. Typically, these three\nsteps would be completed in a matter of seconds. For an equities trade on the other\nhand, there is generally a ﬁve-step process. The client would call his broker to place\nan order, the broker sends the order to the exchange ﬂoor, the specialist on the\nﬂoor tries to match up orders (the broker competes with other brokers to get the\nbest ﬁll for the client), the specialist executes the trade, and the client receives a\nconﬁrmation from the broker. The elimination of a middleman minimizes the error\nrates in currency trades and increases the efﬁciency of each transaction.\nLimited Slippage\nUnlike the equity markets, many online FX market makers provide instantaneous\nexecution from real-time, two-way quotes. These quotes are the prices where the\nﬁrms are willing to buy or sell the quoted currency, rather than vague indications\nof where the market is trading, which may or may not be honored. Orders are\nexecuted and conﬁrmed within seconds. Robust systems would never request the\nsize of a trader’s potential order, or which side of the market he’s trading, before\ngiving him a bid/offer quote. Inefﬁcient dealers determine whether the investor is a\nbuyer or a seller, and shade the price to increase their own proﬁt on the transaction.\nThe equity market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’ system, under\nwhich you may not get executed at the price you wish, but rather at the next best\nprice available. For example, let’s say Microsoft is trading at $52.50. If you enter a\nbuy order at this rate, by the time it reaches the specialist on the exchange ﬂoor, the\nprice may have risen to $53.25. In this case, you will not get executed at $52.50;\nyou will get executed at $53.25, which is essentially a loss of 3∕4of a point. The\nprice transparency provided by the some of the better market makers assures that\ntraders always receive a fair price.\nPerfect Market for Technical Analysis\nFor technical analysts, currencies rarely spend much time in tight trading ranges and\nhave the tendency to develop strong trends. Over 80% of volume is speculative in\nnature and as a result, the market frequently overshoots and then corrects itself.\nHence, technical analysis works well for the FX market, and a technically trained\ntrader can easily identify new trends and breakouts, which provide multiple oppor-\ntunities to enter and exit positions. Charts and indicators are used by all professional\nFX market traders, and candle charts are available on most charting packages. In addi-\ntion, the most commonly used indicators such as Fibonacci retracements, stochastics,\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET9MACD, moving averages, RSI, and support/resistance levels have proven valid in\nmany instances.\nIn the USDJPY chart shown in Figure 1.1, it is clear that Fibonacci retracements,\nmoving averages, and stochastics have at one point or another given successful\ntrading signals. For example, the 61.8% retracement level served as resistance for\nUSDJPY in December 2014, January 2015, and February 2015. The moving-average\ncrossovers of the 10- and 20-day simple moving averages also successfully forecasted\nthe rally in USDJPY in late October, along with the decline in early January. Equity\ntraders who focus on technical analysis have the easiest transition, since they can\nimplement the same technical strategies that they use in the equities market into the\nFX market.\nAnalyze Stocks Like Countries\nTrading currencies is not a big challenge for fundamental traders either, because\ncountries can be analyzed like stocks. For example, if you analyze growth rates of\nstocks, you can use gross domestic product (GDP) to analyze the growth rate of\ncountries. If you analyze inventory and production ratios, you can follow industrial\nproduction (IP) or durable goods data. If you follow sales ﬁgures, you can analyze\nretail sales data. As with a stock investme n t ,i ti sb e t t e rt oi n v e s ti nt h ec u r r e n c yo fa\ncountry that is growing faster and fund it with a currency of a country that is growing\nslower. Currency prices reﬂect the balance of supply and demand for currencies.\nTwo of the primary factors affecting supply and demand of currencies are interest\nrates and the overall strength of the economy. Economic indicators such as GDP,\nforeign investment, and the trade balance reﬂect the general health of an economy\nand are therefore responsible for the underlying shifts in supply and demand for\nthat currency. There is a tremendous amount of data released at regular intervals,\nsome of which are more important than others. Data related to interest rates and\ninternational trade is the most closely followed.\nIf there is uncertainty regarding the direction of interest rates, any bit of news\non monetary policy can directly affect how the currency trades. Traditionally,\nif a country raises its interest rate, the currency of that country will strengthen\nin relation to other countries as investors shift assets to that country to gain a\nhigher return. In contrast, an interest rates hike is generally bad news for stocks\nbecause it means that borrowing costs have risen. In response, some investors will\ntransfer money out of a country’s stock market when interest rates are increased,\ncausing the country’s currency to weaken. Determining which effect dominates can\nbe tricky, but generally there is an advance consensus on how interest rates will\nmove. Indicators that have the biggest impact on interest rates are producer prices,\nconsumer prices, employment, spending, and GDP. Most of the time monetary\npolicy announcements are known in advance with meeting dates by the Bank of\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET10\nFIGURE 1.1 USDJPY Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET11England (BoE), the Federal Reserve (FED), European Central Bank (ECB), Bank\nof Japan (BoJ), and other central banks posted on their respective websites.\nAnother piece of data that can impact how currencies move is the trade balance,\nwhich shows the net differ ence over a period of time b etween a nation’s exports and\nimports. When a country imports more than it exports, the trade balance will show\na deﬁcit, which is generally considered unfavorable. For example, if U.S. dollars are\nsold for other domestic national currencies (to pay for imports), the ﬂow of dollars\noutside the country will depreciate the value of the dollar. Similarly, if trade ﬁgures\nshow an increase in exports, dollars will ﬂow into the United States and appreciate\nthe value of the dollar. From the standpoint of a national economy, a deﬁcit in and of\nitself is not necessarily a bad thing. If the deﬁcit is greater than market expectations\nhowever, it can trigger a negative price movement.\n■FX versus Futures\nTrading spot forex is also different from trading futures, and like equity traders,\nmany futures traders have also added currency spot trading into their portfolios. We\nknow that the spot forex market has the following attributes:\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nCharacteristics of Futures Markets\n1. There is limited market liquidity depending on the month of contract trades.\n2. The presence of exchange fees results in more costs and commissions.\n3. Market hours for futures trading are much shorter than spot and are dependent\non the product traded; each product may have different open and closing hours,\nand there is limited after-hours trading.\n4. Futures leverage is higher than equities, but still only a fraction of the leverage\noffered in FX.\n5. There tends to be prolonged bear markets.\n6. Pit trading structure increases error and slippage.\nLike in the equities market, traders can implement the same strategies they use\nin analyzing the futures markets in the FX m arket. Most future tr aders are technical\ntraders, and the FX market is perfect for technical analysis. In fact, it is the most\npopular analysis technique used by professional FX traders. Taking a closer look at\nhow the futures market stacks up, we see the following.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET12Comparing Market Hours and Liquidity\nThe volume traded in the FX market is estimated to be over ﬁve times that of the\nfutures market. The FX market is open for trading 24 hours a day, but the futures\nmarket has confusing market hours which vary based on the product traded. For\nexample, if you traded gold futures, it is only open for trading between 7:20am\nand 1:30pm on the COMEX. If you traded crude oil futures on the New York\nMercantile Exchange, t rading would only be ope n between 8:30am. and 2:10pm.\nThese varying hours not only create confusion but also makes it difﬁcult to act on\nbreakthrough announcements throughout the reminder of the day.\nIn addition, if you have a day job and can only trade after hours, futures would be\na very inconvenient market product to trade. You would basically be placing orders\nbased on past prices that are not current market prices. This lack of transparency\nmakes trading very cumbersome. In addition, each time zone has its own unique\nnews and developments that could move speciﬁc currency pairs, and with futures it\ncan difﬁcult to act on breaking overnight news.\nLow to Zero Transaction Costs\nIn the equity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission. With future\nbrokers, average commissions can run close to $160 per trade on positions of\n$100,000 or greater. The OTC structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which can in turn lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight,\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Futures traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow to zero transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade\nfor short-term traders. If you are an active futures trader who typically places 20\ntrades a day, at $100 commission per trade, you would have to pay $2,000 in daily\ntransaction costs. A typical futures trade involves a broker, a future commissions\nmerchant (FCM) order desk, a clerk on the exchange ﬂoor, a runner, and a pit\ntrader. All of these parties need to be paid, and their payment comes in the form of\ncommission and clearing fees, whereas the electronic nature of the market minimizes\nthese costs.\nNo Limit Up or Down Rules/Proﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nUnlike the tight restriction on the futures market, there is no limit down or limit\nup rule in the FX market. For example, on the S&P index futures, if the contract\nvalue falls more than 5% from the previous day’s close, limit down rules will come\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET13in effect, whereby on a 5% move, the index would only be allowed to trade at\nor above this level for the next 10 minutes. For a 20% decline, trading would be\ncompletely halted. Due to the decentralized nature of the FX market, there are no\nexchange-enforced restrictions on daily activity, which can help eliminate missed\nopportunities caused by archaic exchange regulations.\nExecution Quality and Speed/Low Error Rates\nThe futures market is also known for inconsistent execution, both in terms of pricing\nand execution time. Every futures trader has, at some point in time, experienced\na half hour or so wait for a market order to be ﬁlled, only to ﬁnd that the order\nhas been executed at a price far away from where the market was trading when\nthe initial order was placed. Even with electronic trading and limited guarantees of\nexecution speed, the price for ﬁlls on market orders is far from certain. The reason\nfor this inefﬁciency is the number of steps that are involved in placing a futures\ntrade. A futures trade is typically a seven-step process:\n1. The client calls his broker and places his trade (or places it online).\n2. The trading desk receives the order, processes it, and routes it to the FCM\norder desk on the exchange ﬂoor.\n3. The FCM order desk passes the order to the order clerk.\n4. The order clerk hands the order to a runner or signals it to the pit.\n5. The trading clerk goes to the pit to execute the trade.\n6. The trade conﬁrmation goes to the runner or is signaled to the order clerk and\nprocessed by the FCM order desk.\n7. The broker receives the trade conﬁrmation and passes it on to the client.\nAn FX trade in comparison is typically only a three-step process. A trader would\nplace an order on the platform, the FX dealing desk would automatically execute\nit electronically, and the order conﬁrmation would be posted or logged on the\ntrader’s trading station. The elimination of the involvement of these additional\nparties increases the speed of the trade execution and decreases errors.\nIn addition, the futures market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’\nsystem, under which your trades frequently do not get executed at the initial market\norder price, but rather, at the next best price available. For example, let’s say a\nclient is long 5 March Dow Jones futures contracts at 8800. If the client enters a\nstop order at 8700, when the rate reaches this level, the client will most likely be\nexecuted at 8690. This 10-point difference would be attributed to slippage, which\nis very common in the futures market.\nOn most FX trading stations, traders execute directly off of real-time streaming\nprices. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, there is generally no discrepancy\nbetween the displayed price and the execution price. This holds true even during\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET14volatile times and fast-moving markets. In the futures market, execution is uncertain\nbecause all orders must be done on the exchange. This creates a situation where\nliquidity is limited by the number of participants, which, in turn, limits quantities\nthat can be traded at a given price. Real-time streaming prices ensure that market\norders, stops, and limits are executed with minimal slippage and no partial ﬁlls.\n■W h oA r et h eP l a y e r si nt h eF XM a r k e t ?\nSince the foreign exchange market is an OTC market without a centralized exchange,\ncompetition between market makers prohibits monopolisti c pricing strategies. If\none market maker attempts to drastically skew the price, then traders simply have\nthe option to ﬁnd another market maker. Moreover, spreads are closely watched to\nensure market makers are not whimsically altering the cost of the trade. Many equity\nmarkets, on the other hand, operate in a completely different fashion; the New York\nStock Exchange, for instance, is the sole place where companies listed on the NYSE\ncan have their stocks traded. Centralized markets are operated by what are referred\nto as specialists. Market makers, on the other hand, is the term used in reference to\ndecentralized marketplaces. Since the NYSE is a centralized market, a stock traded\non the NYSE can only have one bid–ask quote at all times. Decentralized markets,\nsuch as foreign exchange, can have multiple market makers—all of whom have the\nright to quote different prices. Here is an illustration of how both centralized and\ndecentralized markets operate.\nCentralized Markets\nBy their very nature, centralized markets tend to be monopolistic: With a single\nspecialist controlling th e market, prices can easil y be skewed to a ccommodate the\ninterests of the specialist, not those of the traders (see Figure 1.2). If, for example,\nthe market is ﬁlled with sellers that the specialists must buy from but no prospective\nbuyers on the other side, the specialist may simply widen the spread, thereby\nBuyers\nCan buy only\nfrom one\nspecialistSpecialist\nUnites buyers and\nsellers; maintains\nsole control over\nthe spreadSellers\nCan sell only to\none specialist\nFIGURE 1.2 Centralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET15increasing the cost of the trade and preventing additional participants from entering\nthe market. Or, specialists can drastically alter the quotes they are offering, thus\nmanipulating the price to accommodate their own risk tolerance.\nHierarchy of Participants\nWhile the foreign exchange market is decentralized, and hence employs multiple\nmarket makers rather than a single specialist, participants in the FX market are\norganized into a hierarchy; those with superior credit access, volume transacted,\nand sophistication receive priority pricing in the market (see Figure 1.3). At the\ntop of the food chain is the interbank market, which trades the highest volume per\nday in relatively few currencies. In the interbank market, the largest banks can deal\nwith each other directly, via interbank brokers, or through electronic brokering\nsystems like EBS or Reuters. The interbank market is a credit-approved system,\nwhere banks trade based solely on the credit relationships they have established\nwith one another. The banks can see the rates everyone is dealing at, but each bank\nmust have a speciﬁc credit relationship with that bank in order to trade at the rates\nbeing offered. Other institutions such as online FX market makers, hedge funds,\nand corporations must trade FX through these banks, although some have created\ntheir own liquidity pools through the years. Many banks (e.g., small community\nbanks or banks in emerging markets), corporations, and institutional investors do\nnot have access to these rates because they have no established credit lines with\nbig banks. This forces smaller participants to deal through just one bank for their\nRetail Clients\nTrader\nTrader\nTrader\nTraderOnline TradingInterbank Market\nBank Bank\nBank BankEBS and\nReutersOnline FX\nMarket\nMakers\nFIGURE 1.3 Decentralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET16foreign exchange needs, and oftentimes this means much less competitive rates for\nthe participants further down the participant hierarchy. Those receiving the least\ncompetitive rates are customers of banks and physical currency exchange companies.\nRecently, technology has broken down the barriers that used to stand between the\nend-users of foreign exchange services and the interbank market. The online trading\nrevolution opened its doors to retail clientele by connecting market makers and\nmarket participants in an efﬁcient, low-cost manner. In essence, online trading\nplatforms serve as a gateway to the liquid FX market. Average traders can now\ntrade alongside the biggest banks in the world, with virtually similar pricing and\nexecution. What used to be a game dominated and controlled by the ‘‘big boys’’ is\nslowly becoming a level playing ﬁeld where individuals can proﬁt and take advantage\nof the same opportunities as big banks. FX is no longer an old boys club, which\nmeans opportunities abound for aspiring online currency traders.\nDealing Stations— Interbank Market\nFor serious traders who want to know more about the interbank market, the\nmajority of FX volume is actually transacted primarily through the interbank\nmarket. The leading banks of the world trade with each other electronically\nover two platforms—the EBS and Reuters, dealing 3000-spot matching. Both\nplatforms offer trading in the major currency pairs; however, certain currency\npairs are more liquid and generally more frequently traded over one versus the\nother. Some cross-currency pairs are traded over these platforms as well, but\nothers are calculated from the rates of the major currency pairs and are then offset\nusing the ‘‘legs.’’ For example, if an interbank trader had a client who wanted to\ngo long NZDCAD, the trader would most likely buy NZDUSD and USDCAD\nseparately. The trader would then multiply these rates and provide the client with\nthe respective NZDCAD rate, creating a synthetic quote and trade.\n17CHAPTER 2\nHistorical Events in\nthe FX Markets\nBefore learning how to trade currencies, it is important for every new and\nseasoned market participant to have some understanding about the most\nimportant historical events that have shaped the currency market. To this day, these\nevents are often referenced by professional traders.\n■Bretton Woods: Anointing the Dollar as the World\nCurrency (1944)\nIn July 1944, representatives of 44 nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire,\nto create a new institutional arrangement for governing the international economy\nin the years following World War II. Most agreed that international economic\ninstability was one of the principle causes of the war, and that such instability needed\nto be prevented in the future. The agreement, which was developed by renowned\neconomists John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White, was initially proposed\nto Great Britain as a part of the Lend Lease Act—an American act designed to assist\nGreat Britain in postwar redevelopment efforts. After various negotiations, the ﬁnal\nform of the Bretton Woods Agreement consisted of three key items:\n1. The formation of key international authorities designed to promote fair trade\nand international economic harmony\n2. The ﬁxation of exchange rates between currencies\n3. The convertibility between gold and t he U.S. dollar, thus empowering the U.S.\ndollar as the reserve currency of choice for the world\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS18Of these three parameters, only the ﬁrst is still in existence today, but the\norganizations formed as a direct result of Bretton Woods include the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT); and they all play a crucial role in modern day development and regulation\nof international economies. Since the demise of Bretton Woods, the IMF has\nworked closely with the World Bank. Toge ther, the two institutions now regularly\nlend funds to developing nations, assisting them in the development of a public\ninfrastructure capable of supporting a sound mercantile economy that can contribute\nin the international arena. In order to ensure that these nations can actually enjoy\nequal and legitimate access to trade with their industrialized counterparts, the World\nBank and IMF must work closely with GATT. While GATT was initially meant to\nbe a temporary organization, it now operates to encourage the dismantling of trade\nbarriers—namely, tariffs and quotas.\nThe Bretton Woods Agreement existed from 1944 to 1971, after which it\nwas replaced by the Smithsonian Agreement, an international contract pioneered\nby U.S. President Richard Nixon out the necessity to accommodate for Bretton\nWoods’ shortcomings. Unfortunately, the Smithsonian Agreement possessed the\nsame critical weakness: While it did not include gold/U.S. dollar convertibility,\nit maintained ﬁxed exchange rates—a facet that did not accommodate the United\nStates’ ongoing trade deﬁcit and the international need for a weaker U.S. dollar. As\na result, the Smithsonian Agreement was short-lived.\nUltimately, the exchange rates of t he world evolved into a free market,\nwhere supply and demand were the sole criteria that determined the value of a\ncurrency. While this did and still does result in a number of currency crises and\ngreater volatility between currencies, it also allowed the market to become self-\nregulating, and thus could dictate the appropriate value of a currency without any\nhindrances.\nAs for Bretton Woods, perhaps its most memorable contribution to the interna-\ntional economic arena was its role in changing the international perception about the\nU.S. dollar. While the euro is a revolutionary currency blazing new frontiers in both\nsocial behavior and international trade, the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve\ncurrency of choice. This is due, in large part, to the Bretton Woods Agreement:\nBy establishing dollar/gold convertibility, the dollar’s role as the world’s most\naccessible and reliable currency was ﬁrmly cemented. So while Bretton Woods\nmight be a doctrine of yesteryear, its impact on the U.S. dollar and international\neconomics still resonates today.\n■The End of Bretton Woods: Free Market\nCapitalism Is Born (1971)\nOn August 15, 1971, it became ofﬁcial: The Bretton-Woods system was abandoned\nonce and for all. While it had been exorcised before—only to subsequently emerge\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS19in a new form—this ﬁnal eradication of the Bretton Woods system was truly its\nlast stand: No longer would currencies be ﬁxed in value to gold, allowed only to\nﬂuctuate in a 1% range, but instead, their fair valuation could be determined by\nfree-market behavior such as trade ﬂows and foreign direct investment.\nAlthough U.S. President Nixon was conﬁdent that the end of the Bretton Woods\nsystem would bring about better times for the international economy, he was\nnot a believer that the free market could dictate a currency’s true valuation in a\nfair and catastrophe-free manner. Nixon and many well-respected economists at\nthe time reasoned that an entirely unstructured foreign exchange market would\nresult in competing devaluations, which, in turn, would lead to the breakdown of\ninternational trade and investment. The end result, Nixon and his board of economic\nadvisors argued, would be global depression.\nIn response, the Smithsonian Agreement was introduced a few months later.\nHailed by President Nixon as the ‘‘greatest monetary agreement in the history of\nthe world,’’ the Smithsonian Agreement strived to maintain ﬁxed exchange rates\nwithout the backing of gold. Its key difference from the Bretton Woods system was\nthat the value of the dollar could ﬂoat in a range of 2.25%, compared to just 1%\nunder Bretton Woods.\nUltimately, the Smithsonian Agreement proved to be unfeasible as well. Without\nexchange rates ﬁxed to gold, the free market gold price shot up to $215 per\nounce. Moreover, the U.S. trade deﬁcit continued to grow, and from a fundamental\nstandpoint, the U.S. dollar needed to be devalued beyond the 2.25% parameters\nestablished by the Smithsonian Agreement. In light of these problems, the foreign\nexchange markets were forced to close in February 1972.\nThe markets reopened in March 1973, and this time, they were not bound by a\nSmithsonian Agreement: The value of the US dollar was to be determined entirely\nby the market, as its value was not ﬁxed to any commodity, nor was its exchange rate\nﬂuctuation conﬁned to certain parameters. While this did provide the U.S. dollar,\nand other currencies by default, the agility required to adapt to a new and rapidly\nevolving international trading environment, it also set the stage for unprecedented\ninﬂation. The end of Bretton Woods and the Smithsonian Agreement, as well as\nconﬂicts in the Middle East, resulted in substantially higher oil prices and helped\nto create stagﬂation—the synthesis of unemployment and inﬂation—in the U.S.\neconomy. It would not be until later in the decade, when Federal Reserve Chairman\nPaul Volcker initiated new economic policies and President Reagan introduced a new\nﬁscal agenda, that the U.S. dollar would return to ‘‘normal’’ valuations. By then,\nthe foreign exchange markets had thoroughly developed and were capable of serving\na multitude of purposes. In addition to employing a laissez-faire style of regulation\non international trade, they also were beginning to attract speculators seeking to\nparticipate in a market with unrivaled liquidity and continued growth. Ultimately,\nthe death of Bretton Woods in 1971 marked the beginning of a new economic era, one\nthat liberated international trading while also proliferating speculative opportunities.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS20■Plaza Accord—Devaluation\nof the U.S. Dollar (1985)\nAfter the demise of all the various exchange rate regulatory mechanisms that\ncharacterized the twentieth century—t hat is, the Gold Standard, the Bretton\nWoods Standard, and the Smithsonian Agreement—the currency market was left\nwith virtually no regulation other than the mythical ‘‘invisible hand’’ of free\nmarket capitalism, one that supposedly strived to create economic balance through\nsupply and demand. Unfortunately, due to a number of unforeseen economic\nevents—such as the OPEC oil crises, stagﬂation throughout the 1970s, and drastic\nchanges in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ﬁscal policy—supply and demand, in and\nof themselves, became insufﬁcient means by which the currency markets could be\nregulated. A system of sorts was needed, but not one that was inﬂexible: Fixation of\ncurrency values to a commodity, such as gold, proved to be too rigid for economic\ndevelopment, as was also the notion of ﬁxing maximum exchange rate ﬂuctuations.\nThe balance between structure and rigidity was one that had plagued the currency\nmarkets throughout the twentieth century, and while advancements had been made,\na deﬁnitive solution was still greatly needed.\nHence, in 1985, the respective ministers of ﬁnance and central bank governors\nof the world’s leading economies—France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom,\nand the United States—convened in New York City, with the hopes of arranging a\ndiplomatic agreement that would work to optimize the economic effectiveness of\nthe foreign exchange markets. Meeting at the Plaza Hotel, the international leaders\ncame to the following agreements regarding speciﬁc economies and the international\neconomy as a whole:\n■Across the world, inﬂation was at very low levels. Contrary to the stagﬂation of\nthe 1970s—where inﬂation was high and real economic growth was low—the\nglobal economy in 1985 had done a complete 180, as inﬂation was now low and\ngrowth was strong.\n■While low inﬂation, even when coupled with robust economic growth, still\nallowed for low interest rates—a caveat that developing countries particularly\nenjoyed—there was an imminent danger of protectionist policies such as tariffs\nentering the economy. The United States was experiencing a large and growing\ncurrent account deﬁcit, while Japan and Germany were facing large and growing\nsurpluses. An imbalance so fundamental in nature could create serious economic\ndisequilibrium, which, in turn, would result in a distortion of the foreign exchange\nmarkets, and thus, the international economy as a whole.\n■The results of current account imbalances, and the protectionist policies that\nensued, required action. Ultimately, it was believed that the rapid acceleration\nin the value of the U.S. dollar, which appreciated more than 80% against the\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS21currencies of its major trading partners, was the primary culprit. The rising\nvalue of the U.S. dollar created enormous trade deﬁcits, hurting many different\neconomies.\nAt the meeting in the Plaza Hotel, the Uni ted States persuad ed other attending\ncountries to coordinate a multilateral intervention, and on September 22, 1985,\nthe Plaza Accord was implemented. This agreement was designed to allow for\na controlled decline of the dollar and the appreciation of the main anti-dollar\ncurrencies. Each country agreed to changes to their economic policies and to\nintervene in currency markets as necessary to weaken the value of the dollar. The\nUnited States agreed to cut its budget deﬁcit and lower interest rates. France, the\nUnited Kingdom, Germany, and Japan agreed to raise interest rates. Germany also\nagreed to tax cuts, while Japan agreed to let the value of the yen ‘‘fully reﬂect\nthe underlying strength of the Japanese economy.’’ However, one major problem\nwas that not every country adhered to their pledges made under the Plaza Accord.\nThe United States, in particular, did not follow through with its initial promise to\ncut the budget deﬁcit. Japan was severely hurt by the sharp rise in the yen, as its\nexporters were unable to remain competitive overseas, and it is argued that this\neventually triggered a 10-year recession in Japan. The United S tates, on the other\nhand, enjoyed considerable growth and price stability as a result of the agreement.\nThe effects of the multilateral intervention were seen immediately, and within\nless than two years, the dollar fell 46% and 50% against the German deutschemark\nand the Japanese yen, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.1.

This gradually resolved\nthe current account deﬁcits for the time being, and also ensured that protectionist\npolicies were minimal and nonthreatening. But perhaps most importantly, the\nPlaza Accord cemented the role of the central banks in regulating exchange rate\nmovement—yes, the rates would not be ﬁxed, and hence would be determined\nprimarily by supply and demand; but ultimately, such an invisible hand is insufﬁcient,\nand it was the right and responsibility of the world’s central banks to intervene on\nbehalf of the international economy when necessary.\n■George Soros—The Man Who Broke the Bank\nof England\nWhen George Soros placed a $10 billion speculative bet on the UK pound and\nwon, he became universally known as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England.’’\nWhether you love him or hate him, Soros led the charge in one of the most\nfascinating events in currency trading history. Here are the details.\nThe UK Joins the Exchange Rate Mechanism\nIn 1979, a Franco-German initiative set up the European Monetary System (EMS) to\nstabilize exchange rates, reduce inﬂation, and prepare for monetary integration. The\nExchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), one of the EMS’s main components, gave each\nparticipatory currency a central exchange rate against a basket of currencies, the\nEuropean Currency Unit (ECU). Participants (initially France, Germany, Italy, the\nNetherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and Luxemburg) were then required to\nmaintain their exchange rates within a 2.25% ﬂuctuation band above or below each\nbilateral central rate. The ERM was an adjustable-peg system, and nine realignments\nwould occur between 1979 and 1987. Whil e the United Kingdom was not one of\nthe original members, it would eventually join in 1990 at a rate of DM2.95 to the\npound and with a ﬂuctuation band of +/–6%.\nUntil mid-1992, the ERM appeared to be a success, as a disciplinary effect\nhad reduced inﬂation throughout Europe under the leadership of the German\nBundesbank. The stability wouldn’t last, however, as international investors started\nworrying that the exchange rate values of several currencies within the ERM\nwere inappropriate. Following German reuniﬁcation in 1989 government spending\nsurged, forcing the Bundesbank to print more money. This led to high inﬂation\nand left the German central bank with little choice but to increase interest rates.\nHowever, the rate hike came with consequences as it placed upward pressure on\nthe German mark. This forced other central banks to raise their interest rates as\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS23well as to maintain their pegged currency exchange rates (a direct application of\nIrving Fischer’s interest parity theory). Realizing that the UK’s weak economy and\nhigh unemployment rate would not permit the British government to maintain this\npolicy for long, George Soros stepped into action.\nSoros Bets Against the Success of UK Involvement in the ERM\nThe quantum hedge fund manager essentially wanted to bet that the pound would\ndepreciate because the United Kingdom would either devalue the pound or leave the\nERM. Thanks to the progressive removal of capital controls during the EMS years,\ninternational investors at the time had more freedom than ever to take advantage\nof perceived disequilibria, so Soros established short positions in pounds and long\npositions in marks by borrowing pounds and investing in mark-denominated assets.\nHe also made great use of options and futures. In all, his positions accounted for\na gargantuan $10 billion. Soros was not the only one; many other investors soon\nfollowed suit. Everyone was selling pounds, placing tremendous downward pressure\non the currency.\nAt ﬁrst, the Bank of England (BoE) tried to defend the pegged rates by buying\n15 billion pounds with its large reserve assets, but its sterilized interventions\n(whereby the monetary base is held constant thanks to open market interventions)\nwere limited in their effectiveness. The pound was trading dangerously close to the\nlower levels of its ﬁxed band. On September 16, 1992, a day that would later be\nknown as Black Wednesday, the bank announced a 2% rise in interest rates (from\n10% to 12%) in an attempt to boost the pound’s appeal. A few hours later, it\npromised to raise rates again to 15%, but international investors such as Soros could\nnot be swayed, knowing that huge proﬁts were right around the corner. Traders\nkept selling pounds in huge volumes, and the BoE kept buying them until, ﬁnally, at\n7:00 pm that same day, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced that Britain would\nleave the ERM and that rates would return to their initial level of 10%. The chaotic\nBlack Wednesday marked the beginning of a steep depreciation in the pound’s\neffective value.\nWhether the return to a ﬂoating currency was due to the Soros-led attack on\nthe pound or because of simple fundamental analysis is still debated today. What\nis certain, however, is that the pound’s depreciation of almost 15% against the\ndeutschemark and 25% against the dollar over the next ﬁve weeks as seen in Figure 2.2\nand Figure 2.3 resulted in tremendous proﬁts for Soros and others traders (the pound\nalso weakened by a similar proportion to the dollar). Within a month, the quantum\nfund cashed in on approximately $2 billion by selling the now more expensive\nDMs and buying back the now cheaper pounds. ‘‘The man who broke the Bank of\nEngland’’ showed how central banks can still be vulnerable to speculative attacks.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS243.00British Pound vs. Deutschemark (GBPDEM)\n2.90\n2.80\n2.70\n2.60\n2.50\n2.40\n2.30\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.2 GBPDEM after Soros\n2.10\n2.00\n1 .90\n1 .80\n1 .70\n1 .60\n1 .50\n1 .40British Pound Against US Dollar GBPUSD\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.3 GBPUSD after Soros\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS25■Asian Financial Crisis (1997–1998)\nFalling like a set of dominos on July 2, 1997, the relatively nascent Asian tiger\neconomies provide the perfect example of the interdependence in global capital\nmarkets and their subsequent effects throughout international currency forums.\nBased on several fundamental breakdowns, the cause of the ‘‘contagion’’ stemmed\nlargely from shrouded lending practices, inﬂated trade deﬁcits, and immature capital\nmarkets. Compiled, these factors contributed to a perfect storm that left major\nregional markets incapacitated and once-prized currencies devalued to signiﬁcantly\nlower levels. With adverse effects easily seen in the equities markets, currency\nmarket ﬂuctuations were negatively impacted in much the same manner during this\ntime period.\nThe Bubble\nLeading up to 1997, investors had become increasingly attracted to Asian investment\nprospects, focusing on real estate development and domestic equities. As a result,\nforeign investment capital ﬂowed into the region as economic growth rates climbed\non improved production in countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and\nKorea. Thailand, home of the baht, experienced a 6.5% growth rate in 1996, falling\nfrom 13% in 1988. Lending additional support for a stronger economy was the\nenactment of a ﬁxed currency peg to the U.S. dollar. With a ﬁxed valuation to\nthe greenback, countries like Thailand could ensure ﬁnancial stability in their own\nmarkets and a constant rate for export trading purposes with the world’s largest\neconomy. Ultimately, the region’s national currencies appreciated, as underlying\nfundamentals were justiﬁed and increased speculative positions of further climbs in\nprice mounted.\nBallooning Current Account Deﬁcits and Nonperforming Loans\nHowever, in early 1997, a shift in sentiment began to occur as international account\ndeﬁcits became increasingly difﬁcult for respective governments to handle and\nlending practices were revealed to be detrimental to the economic infrastructure. In\nparticular, economists were alerted to the fact that Thailand’s current account deﬁcit\nballooned in 1996 to $14.7 billion and had been climbing since 1992. Although\ncomparatively smaller than the U.S. deﬁcit, the gap represented 8% of the country’s\ngross domestic product. Shrouded lending practices also contributed heavily to\nthese breakdowns, as close personal relationships with high-ranking banking ofﬁcials\nwere well rewarded and surprisingly common throughout the region. In particular\nthis affected many of South Korea’s highly leveraged conglomerates as total\nnonperforming loan values skyrocketed to 7.5 percent of gross domestic product.\nAdditional evidence of these practices could be observed in ﬁnancial institutions\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS26throughout Japan. First announcing questionable and nonperforming loans of\n$136 billion in 1994, Japanese authorities admitted to an alarming $400 billion\ntotal a year later. Coupled with a then-crippled stock market, cooling real estate\nvalues, and dramatic slowdowns in the economy, investors saw opportunity in\na depreciating yen, subsequently adding selling pressure to neighbor currencies.\nWhen their own asset bubble collapsed, asset prices fell by $10 trillion, with\nthe fall in real estate prices accounting for nearly 65% of the total decline—the\nlosses were worth two years of national output. This fall in asset prices sparked\nthe banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early 1990s and then developed into a\nfull-blown, systemic crisis in 1997, following the failure of a number of high-proﬁle\nﬁnancial institutions. In response, Japanese monetary authorities issued rhetoric on\npotentially increasing benchmark interest rates in hopes of defending the domestic\ncurrency valuation. Unfortunately, these considerations never materialized and a\nshortfall ensued. Sparked mainly by an announcement of a managed ﬂoat of the Thai\nbaht, the slide snowballed as central bank reserves evaporated and currency price\nlevels became unsustainable in light of downside selling pressure.\nCurrency Crisis\nFollowing mass short speculation and attempted intervention, the aforementioned\nAsian economies were left ruined and momentarily incapacitated. The Thailand baht,\na once-prized possession, was devalued by as much as 48 percent, even slumping\ncloser to a 100% fall at the turn of the new year. The most adversely affected was\n01/01/97 02/01/97 03/01/97 04/01/97 05/01/97 06/01/97 07/01/97 08/01/97 09/01/97 10/01/97 11/01/97 12/01/97 01/01/98 02/01/98 03/01/98 04/01/9860\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0140001997–98 Asian Currency Fluctuations\n12000\n10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0Thailand Baht Indonesia Rupiah\nFIGURE 2.4 Asian Crisis Price Action\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS27150USDJPY During Asian Crisis\n145\n140\n135\n130\n125\n120\n115\n110\n105\n100\n5/3/19966/3/19967/3/19968/3/19969/3/199610/3/199611/3/199612/3/19961/3/19972/3/19973/3/19974/3/19975/3/19976/3/19977/3/19978/3/19979/3/199710/3/199711/3/199712/3/19971/3/19982/3/19983/3/19984/3/19985/3/19986/3/1998\nFIGURE 2.5 USDJPY Asian Crisis Price Action\nthe Indonesian rupiah.

Among the majors, the Japanese yen fell approximately 23%\nfrom its high to low against the U.S. do llar between 1997 and 1998, and after having\nretraced a signiﬁcant portion of its losses, ended the 8-month debacle down 15%,\na ss h o w ni nF i g u r e2 . 5 .\nLasting for less than a year, the ﬁnancial crisis of 1997 revealed the interconnec-\ntivity of economies and their effects in the global currency markets. Additionally, it\nshowed the inability of central banks to successfully intervene in currency valuations\nwith the absence of secure economic fundamentals and overwhelming market forces.\nToday, with the assistance of IMF reparation packages and the implementation of\nstricter requirements, Asia’s four little dragons are healthy once again. With inﬂa-\ntionary benchmarks and a revived exporting market, Southeast Asia is building back\nits once prominent stature among the world’s industrialized economic regions. With\nthe experience of evaporating currency reserves under their belt, the Asian tigers\nnow take active initiatives to ensure that there is large pot of reserves on hand in\ncase speculators attempt to attack their currencies once again.\n■Introduction of the Euro (1999)\nThe introduction of the euro was a monumental achievement, marking the largest\nmonetary changeover ever. The euro was ofﬁcially launched as an electronic trading\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS28currency on January 1, 1999. Euro notes and coins were put into circulation in 2002.\nThe 11 initial member states were: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy,\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, and Finland. As of 2015, there\nare 17 countries in the Eurozone. Each country ﬁxed its currency to a speciﬁc\nconversion rate against the euro, and a common monetary policy governed by the\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) was adopted. To many economists, the system would\nideally include all of the original 15 EU nations, but the United Kingdom, Sweden,\nand Denmark decided to keep their own currencies. In deciding whether to adopt\nthe euro, EU members have many important factors to consider.\nThe 1993 Maastricht Treaty sets out ﬁve main convergence criteria for member\nstates to participate in the European Monetary Union (EMU):\nMaastricht Treaty: C onvergence Criteria\n■The country’s government budget deﬁcit could not be greater than 3% of GDP.\n■The country’s government debt could not be larger than 60% of GDP.\n■The country’s exchange rate had to be maintained within ERM bands without any\nrealignment for two years prior to joining.\n■The country’s inﬂation rate could not be higher than 1.5% above the average\ninﬂation rate of the three EU countries with the lowest inﬂation rates.\n■The country’s long-term interest rate on government bonds could not be higher\nthan 2% above the average of the comparable rates in the three countries with the\nlowest inﬂation.\nAlthough the ease of traveling is one of the most attractive reasons to join the\neuro, being part of the monetary union provides other beneﬁts:\n■It eliminates exchange rate ﬂuctuations, providing a more stable environment to\ntrade within the euro area.\n■The purging of all exchange rate risk within the zone allows businesses to plan\ninvestment decisions with greater certainty.\n■Transaction costs also diminish, mainly those relating to foreign exchange\noperations, hedging operations, cross-border payments, and the management of\nseveral currency accounts.\n■Prices become more transparent as consumers and businesses can compare prices\nacross countries more easily, which, in turn, increases competition.\n■A huge single currency market becomes more attractive for foreign investors.\n■The economy’s magnitude and stability allow the ECB to control inﬂation with\nlower interest rates, thanks to increased credibility.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS\nk\nk29\nk\nk\nFIGURE 2.6 EURUSD Price Since Launch\nSource: eSignal\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS30Yet the euro is not without its limitations. Leaving aside political sovereignty\nissues, the main problem is that, by adopting the euro, a nation essentially forfeits\nany independent monetary policy. Since each country’s economy is not perfectly\ncorrelated to the EMU’s economy, a nation might ﬁnd the ECB hiking interest\nrates during a domestic recession. This can be particularly true for many of the\nsmaller nations. As a result, countries try to rely more heavily on ﬁscal policy, but\nthe efﬁciency of ﬁscal policy is limited when it is not effectively combined with\nmonetary policy. This inefﬁciency is further exacerbated by the 3% of GDP limit on\nbudget deﬁcits, as stipulated by the Stability and Growth Pact.\nSome concerns also subsist regarding the ECB’s effectiveness as a central bank.\nThe central bank strives for a 2% inﬂation target, but in the past 15 years, it strayed\naway from this level often. Also, from 1999 to late 2002, a lack of conﬁdence\nin the union’s currency (and in the union itself) led to a 24% depreciation, from\napproximately $1.15 to the euro in January 1999 to $0.88 in May 2000, forcing\nthe ECB to intervene in foreign exchange markets in the last few months of 2000.\nFigure 2.6 shows a daily chart of the euro since it was launched in 1999.\nSince 2000, things have greatly changed, with the euro trading at a premium to\nthe dollar, but quantitative easing in 2014 put the currency back in a downtrend\nversus the dollar. Some analysts claim that the euro will one day replace the dollar\nas the world’s dominant international currency, and while we believe it will have a\ngreater share in reserve portfolios, we doubt that this will be likely.\n31CHAPTER 3\nWhat Moves the\nCurrency Market?\nNow that we know a little bit about the history of the forex market, let’s take a\nlook at what moves currencies. There are two primary ways to analyze ﬁnancial\nmarkets: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis is rooted\nin understanding underlying economic conditions, while technical analysis uses\nhistorical prices to predict future movements. For as long as technical analysis\nhas been around, there has been an ongoing debate as to which methodology\nis more successful. Short-term traders prefer to use technical analysis, focusing\ntheir strategies primarily on price action, while medium-term traders tend to use\nfundamental analysis to determine a currency’s current and future valuation.\nBefore implementing successful trading strategies, it is important to understand\nwhat drives the movements of currencies in the foreign exchange market. The\nbest strategies tend to be the ones that combine both fundamental and technical\nanalysis. Textbook perfect technical formations have failed too often because of\nmajor fundamental news and events like U.S. nonfarm payrolls. But trading on\nfundamentals alone can also be risky. There will oftentimes be sharp gyrations in\nthe price of currency on a day when there are no news or economic reports. This\nsuggests that the price action is driven by nothing more than ﬂows, sentiment, and\npattern formations. Therefore, it is very important for technical traders to be aware\nof the key economic data or events that are scheduled for release, and, in turn,\nfor fundamental traders to be aware of important technical levels that the general\nmarket may be focusing on.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?32■Fundamental Analysis\nFundamental analysis focuses on the economic, social, and political forces that drive\nsupply and demand. Those using fundamental analysis as a trading tool look at\nvarious macroeconomic indicators such as growth rates, interest rates, inﬂation,\nand unemployment. We outlined some of the most important economic releases\nin the ﬁrst chapter of this book. Fundamental analysts will combine all of this\ninformation to assess current and future performance. This requires a lot of work\nand thorough analysis, as there is no single set of beliefs that guides fundamental\nanalysis. Traders employing fundamental analysis need to continually keep abreast\nof news and announcements, as they can indicate potential changes to the economic,\nsocial, and political environment. All traders should be aware of the broad economic\nconditions before placing trades. This is especially important for day traders who\nare trying to make trading decisions based on news events because even though\nFederal Reserve Monetary Policy decisions are always important, if the rate move is\ncompletely priced into the market, then the actual reaction in the EURUSD could\nbe nominal.\nTaking a step back, currencies move primarily based on supply and demand.\nThat is, on the most fundamental level, a currency rallies because there is demand\nfor that currency. Regardless of whether the demand is for hedging, speculative,\nor conversion purposes, true movements are based on the need for the currency.\nCurrency values decrease when there is excess supply. Supply and demand should be\nthe real determinants for predicting future movements. However, how to predict\nsupply and demand is not as simple as many would think. There are many factors\nthat contribute to the net supply and demand for a currency. This includes capital\nﬂows, trade ﬂows, speculative, and hedging needs.\nFor example, the U.S. dollar was very strong (against the euro) between 1999\nand the end of 2001. This rally was driven primarily by the dot-com boom and the\ndesire by foreign investors to participate in these elevated returns. This demand\nfor U.S. assets required foreign investors to sell their local currencies and purchase\nU.S. dollars. Since the end of 2001, geopolitical uncertainty arose, the United States\nstarted cutting interest rates, and foreign investors started to sell U.S. assets in\nsearch of higher yields elsewhere. This required foreign investors to sell U.S. dollars,\nincreasing supply and lowering the dollar’s value against other major currency pairs.\nThe availability of funding or interest in buying a currency is a major factor that can\nimpact the direction that a currency trades. It was one of the primary drivers of the\nU.S. dollar between 2002 and 2005, making foreign ofﬁcial purchases of U.S. assets\n(also known as the Treasury International Capital Flow, or TIC data) an important\neconomic indicator.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?33Capital and Trade Flows\nCapital ﬂows and trade ﬂows constitute a country’s balance of payments, which\nquantiﬁes the amount of demand for a currency over a given period of time.\nTheoretically, a balance of payments equal to zero is required for a currency to\nmaintain its current valuation. A negative balance of payments number, on the other\nhand, indicates that capital is leaving the economy at a more rapid rate than it is\nentering, and hence, it should fall in value.\nThis is particularly important in current conditions (at the time of this book’s\npublication), where the United States is running a consistently large trade deﬁcit\nwithout sufﬁcient foreign inﬂow to fund that deﬁcit. As a result of this very problem,\nthe trade-weighted dollar index fell 22% in value between 2003 and 2005. The\nJapanese yen is another good example. As one of the world’s largest exporters, Japan\nruns a very high trade surplus. Therefore, despite a zero interest rate policy that\nprevents capital ﬂows from increasing, the yen has a natural tendency to trade lower\nbased on trade ﬂows, which is the other side of the equation. To be more speciﬁc,\nfollowing is a more detailed explanation of what capital and trade ﬂows encompass.\nCapital Flows\nCapital ﬂows measure the net amount of a currency that is being purchased or sold\ndue to capital investments. A positive capital ﬂow balance implies that foreign inﬂows\nof physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed outﬂows. A negative\ncapital ﬂow balance indicates that there are more physical or portfolio investments\nbought by domestic investors than foreign investors. There are generally two types\nof capital ﬂows—physical ﬂows and portfolio ﬂows (which are further segmented\ninto equity markets and ﬁxed-income markets).\nPhysical Flows\nPhysical ﬂows encompass actual foreign direct investments by corporations such as\ninvestments in real estate, manufacturing, and local acquisitions. All of these require\nthat a foreign corporation sell its local currency and buy the foreign currency, which\nleads to movements in the FX market. This is particularly important for global\nmergers and corporate acquisitions that involve more cash than stock.\nPhysical ﬂows are important to watch, as they represent the underlying changes\nin actual physical investment activity. These ﬂows shift in response to changes in\neach country’s ﬁnancial health and growth opportunities. Changes in local laws that\nencourage foreign investment also serve to promote physical ﬂows. For example,\ndue to China’s entry into the WTO, its foreign investment laws have been relaxed.\nAs a result of China’s cheap labor and attractive revenue opportunities (population\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?34of over 1 billion), corporations globally have ﬂooded China with investments. From\nan FX perspective, in order to fund investments in China, foreign corporations need\nto sell their local currency and buy Chinese renminbi (RMB).\nPortfolio Flows in Equity Markets\nAs technology has enabled greater ease with respect to transportation of capital,\ninvesting in global equity markets has become far more feasible. Accordingly, a\nrallying stock market in any part of the world serves as an ideal opportunity for all,\nregardless of geographic location. The result of this has become a strong correlation\nbetween a country’s equity markets and its currency: If the equity market is rising,\ninvestment dollars generally come in to seize the opportunity. Alternatively, falling\nequity markets could prompt domestic investors to sell their shares of local publicly\ntraded ﬁrms to take advantage of investment opportunities abroad.\nThe attraction of equity markets over ﬁxed-income markets has increased across\nthe years. Since the early 1990s, the ratio of foreign transactions in U.S. government\nbonds over U.S. equities has declined from 10 to 1 to 2 to 1. As indicated in\nFigure 3.1, it is evident that the Dow had a high correlation (of approximately 81%)\nwith the U.S. dollar (against the EUR) between 1994 and 1999. In addition, from\n1991–1999, the Dow increased 300%, while the USD index appreciated nearly 30%\nfor the same time period. As a result, currency traders closely followed the global\nequity markets to predict short and intermediate term equity-based capital ﬂows.\nHowever, this relationship shifted after the tech bubble burst in the United States as\n1/31/9412500 1. 15\n1. 10\n1 .05\n1 .00\n0.95\n0.90\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n0.70\n0.6511500\n10500\n9500\n8500\n7500\n6500\n5500\n4500\n3500\n6/30/94 11/30/94 4/28/95 9/29/95 2/29/96 7/31/96 12/31/96Dow Jones and USDEUR\n5/30/97 10/31/97 3/31/98 8/31/98 1/29/99 6/30/99 11/30/99INDU Index Px Last USDEUR Curncy\nFIGURE 3.1 Dow and USDEUR\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?35foreign investors remained relatively risk averse causing a lower correlation between\nthe performance of the U.S. equity market and the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, a\nrelationship still exists, making it important for all traders to keep an eye on global\nmarket performances in search of intermarket opportunities.\nPortfolio Flows in Fixed-Income Markets\nJust as the equity market is correlated to exchange rate movement, so too is the\nﬁxed-income market. In times of global uncertainty, ﬁxed-income investments can\nbecome particularly appealing, due to the inherent safety they possess. As a result,\neconomies boasting the most valuable ﬁxed-income opportunities will be capable of\nattracting foreign investment—which will naturally ﬁrst require the purchasing of\nthe country’s respective currency.\nA good gauge of ﬁxed-income capital ﬂows are the short- and long-term yields of\ninternational government bonds. It is important to monitor the spread differential\nbetween the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the yield on foreign bonds because\ninternational investors tend to move money from one country to another in search\nof the highest yielding assets. When U.S. assets have one of the highest yields,\nthis encourages more investments in U.S. ﬁnancial instruments, hence beneﬁting\nthe U.S. dollar. When the United States has the lowest yields, this discourages\ninvestments. Investors can also use short-term yields, such as the spreads on 2-year\ngovernment bonds, to gauge the short-term ﬂow of international funds. Aside from\ngovernment bond yields, Fed fund futures can also be used to estimate movement\nof U.S. funds, as they price in the expectation of future Fed interest rate policy.\nEuribor futures are a barometer for the Euro region’s expected future interest rates\nand can give an indication of EU future policy movements. We will discuss how to\nuse ﬁxed-income products to trade FX further in our strategy section.\nTrade Flows: Measuring Exports versus Imports\nTrade ﬂows are the basis of all international transactions. Just as the investment\nenvironment of a given economy is a key driver of its currency valuation, trade ﬂows\nrepresent a country’s net trade balance. Countries that are net exporters—meaning\nthey sell more goods abroad than they buy—will experience a net trade surplus.\nCountries that are net exporters are more likely to have their currency rise in value\nbecause from the perspective of international trade, their currency is being bought\nmore than it is sold. This impacts currency ﬂows because international clients buying\nthe exported product/service must ﬁrst buy the currency of the exporting nation.\nCountries who are net importers purchase more goods abroad than they sell,\ncreating a trade deﬁcit. These nations will generally see more downward than\nupward pressure on their currencies because in order to purchase these foreign\ngoods, importers must sell their own currency and purchase the currency of the\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?36country from which they are buying the good or service. This accordingly drives\ndown the value of the currency when all else is equal. This concept is important\nbecause it is one of primary reasons why many economists say that certain currencies\nneed to fall to reverse burgeoning trade deﬁcits.\nTo understand this further, let’s imagine that the UK economy is booming,\nand its stock market is performing well. Meanwhile, in the United States, a\nlackluster economy is creating a shortage of investment opportunities. In this type\nof environment U.S. investors will feel more inclined to sell their U.S. dollars and\nbuy British pounds to participate in the outperformance of the UK economy. When\nthey elect to do so, it results in the outﬂow of capital from the United States and\nthe inﬂow of capital into the United Kingdom. From an exchange rate perspective,\nthis would induce a fall in the USD coupled with a rise in the GBP, as demand for\nUSD declines and the demand for GBP increases, translating into strength for the\nGBP/USD currency pair.\nEven day and swing traders will ﬁnd it valuable to keep up with incoming\neconomic reports from the major economies.\nTrading Tip: Charting Economic Surprises\nOne way for traders to stay on top of economic trends is to chart economic data\nsurprises against price action. Figure 3.2 illustrates how this can be done. The chart\ngraphs how much an economic indicator has deviated from its consensus forecast,\nor the ‘‘surprise,’’ and stacks them on the same side and graphs price (blue line)\naction when the data was release against the surprise, with a simple regression line\n(white line). This can be done for all of the major currency pairs and provides a\nvisual guide to understanding whether price action has been in line with economic\nfundamentals and can be used as a guide to future price action. Economic data can\nbe found on the calendars of any major forex website, and price action can generally\nbe downloaded from your trading platforms.\nAccording to Figure 3.2, in November of 2004, there were 14 out of 15 positive\neconomic surprises and yet the dollar sold off against the euro during the month\nof December, which was the month in which the economic data were released.\nAlthough this methodology is not exact, the analysis is simple and past charts\nhave yielded some extremely useful clues to future price action. Figure 3.3 shows\nhow the EURUSD moved the following month. As you can see, the EURUSD\nquickly corrected itself during the month of January, indicating that the fundamental\ndivergence from price action that occurred in December proved to be quite useful\nto dollar longs, which harvested almost 600 pips as the euro quickly retracted a large\npart of its gains in January. This method of analysis, called variant perception, was ﬁrst\ninvented by the legendary hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, who produced\n24% average rates return for 30 consecutive years.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?37US Dollar Data and EURUSD\n1 .3700\n1 .3600\n1 .3500\n1 .3400\n1 .3300\n1 .3200\n1. 3 10 0\n1 .3000\n–100%–26.11%0.00%0.00%1.41%1.46%2.56%2.81%3.55%4.18%14.29%16.67%33.33%43.48%50.25%140.00%\n–50% 0% 50%Durable Goods\nEmpire State Manufacturing\nPhilly Fed\nLeading Economic Indicators\nPersonal Income\nIndustrial Production\nISM Non-Manufacturing\nCurrent Account\nExisting Home Sales\nGDP Annualized\nU.

Large positive and negative\nsurprises in economic data can often yield clues to future price action. If you go back\nand look at the EURUSD charts, you will see that the record current account deﬁcits\nin October 2004 were the catalyst that sent the dollar plunging over the next two\nmonths. In many ways, economic fundamentals matter more in the foreign exchange\nmarket than in any other market, and charts such as these could provide valuable\nclues to price direction. Generally, the 15 most important economic indices are\nchosen from each region, and then a price regression line is superimposed over the\npast 20 days of price data.\n■Technical Analysis\nPrior to the mid-1980s, fundamental traders dominated the FX market. However,\nwith the rising popularity of technical analysis and the advent of new technologies,\nthe inﬂuence of technical trading on the FX market has increased signiﬁcantly. The\navailability of high leverage also led to an increased number of high frequency and\nmomentum. They have become active participants in the FX market, with the acute\nability to inﬂuence currency prices.\nUnlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses on the study of price\nmovements. Technical analysts use historical currency data to forecast the direction\nof future prices. The underlying belief behind technical analysis is that all current\nmarket information is already reﬂected in the price of that currency; therefore,\nstudying price action is all that is required to make informed trading decisions. In a\nnutshell, technical analysis assumes that history will repeat itself.\nTechnical analysis is an extremely popular tool used by short- and medium-term\ntraders for analyzing the forex market. It works especially well in the currency\nmarkets because short-term currency price ﬂuctuations are primarily driven by\nhuman emotions or market perceptions. The primary tool in technical analysis\nis price and charts. Traders will look for trends and patterns to identify trading\nopportunities. The most basic concept of technical analysis is that markets have a\ntendency to trend. Being able to identify trends in their earliest stage of development\nis the key to technical analysis. Range trading is also very popular, and similar tools\ncan be used to identify these setups. Technical analysis integrates price action and\nmomentum to construct a pictorial representation of past currency price action and\nto use this information to predict future performance. Technical analysis tools such\nas Fibonacci retracement levels, moving averages, oscillators, candlestick charts, and\nBollinger bands provide further information on the value of the emotional extremes\nof buyers and sellers. It also helps to gauge when greed and fear are the strongest.\nThere are basically two types of markets, trending or range bound, and in the trade\nparameters section, we outline some rules that can help traders determine the type\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?39of market they trading in right now and the sort of trading opportunities they should\nbe looking for.\nIs Technical Analysis or Fundamental Analysis Better?\nNo one will ever win the age-long battle between technical and fundamental analysis.\nHowever, most individual traders will start trading with technical analysis because\nit is easier to understand and does not require hours of study. Technical analysts can\nalso follow many currencies and markets at one time, whereas fundamental analysts\ntend to focus on a few pairs due to the overwhelming amount of data in the market.\nNonetheless, technical analysis works well because the currency market tends to\ndevelop strong trends. Once technical analysis is mastered, it can be applied with\nequal ease to any time frame or currency traded.\nHowever, it is important to take both strategies into consideration, as fundamental\nanalysis can trigger technical movements such as breakouts or reversal in trends.\nTechnical analysis, on the other hand, can also explain moves that fundamentals\ncannot, especially in quiet markets, causing resistance in trends or unexplainable\nmovements. For example, as shown in Figure 3.4, in the days leading up to\nSeptember 11, USDJPY had just broken out of a triangle formation and looked\npoised to head higher. However, as the chart indicates, instead of breaking higher as\ntechnicians may have anticipated, USDJPY broke down following the September 11,\n2001, terrorist attacks and ended up hitting a low of 115.81 from a high of 121.88\non September 10.\n■Currency Forecasting—What Bookworms\nand Economists Look At\nFor more avid students of foreign exchange who want to learn more about\nfundamental analysis and valuing currencies, this section examines the different\nmodels of currency forecasting used by analysts of the major investment banks.\nThere are seven major models for forecasting currencies, which include the balance\nof payments theory, purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, the monetary\nmodel, the real interest rate differential model, the asset market model, and the\ncurrency substitution model.\nBalance of Payments Theory\nThe balance of payments theory states that exchange rates should be at their\nequilibrium level, which is the rate that produces a stable current account balance.\nCountries with trade deﬁcits experience a run on their foreign exchange reserves\ndue to the fact that exporters to that nation must sell that nation’s currency in order\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?k\nk40k\nk\nFIGURE 3.4 USDJPY September 11th Chart\nSource: eSignal\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?41to receive payment. The cheaper currency makes the nation’s exports less expensive\nabroad, which in turn fuels exports and brings the currency into balance.\nWhat Is the Balance of Payments (BOP)?\nThe balance of payments account is divided into two parts: the current account and\nthe capital account. The current account measures trade in tangible, visible items\nsuch as cars and manufactured goods; the trade balance is the surplus or deﬁcit\nbetween exports and imports. The capital account measures ﬂows of money, such\nas investments for stocks or bonds. Balance of payments data can be found on the\nwebsite of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nTrade Flows\nThe trade balance of a country shows the net difference over a period of time\nbetween a nation’s exports and imports. When a country imports more than it\nexports, the trade balance is negative or is in a deﬁcit. If the country exports more\nthan it imports, the trade balance is positive or is in a surplus. The trade balance\nreﬂects the redistribution of wealth among countries and is a major channel through\nwhich the macroeconomic policies of a country may affect another.\nIn general, if a country has a trade deﬁcit, it is considered to be unfavorable, since\nit negatively impacts the value of the nation’s currency. For example, if U.S. trade\nﬁgures show greater imports than exports, more dollars ﬂow out of the United\nStates and the value of the U.S. currency depreciates. A positive trade balance,\nin comparison, will affect the dollar by causing it to appreciate against the other\ncurrencies.\nCapital Flows\nIn addition to trade ﬂows, there are also capital ﬂows that occur among countries.\nThey record a nation’s incoming and outgoing investment ﬂows, such as payments\nfor entire or parts of companies, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, real estate, and\nfactories. Capital ﬂows are inﬂuenced by many factors, including the ﬁnancial and\neconomic climate of other countries, and can be in the form of physical or portfolio\ninvestments. In general, in developing countries, the composition of capital ﬂows\ntends to be skewed toward foreign direct investment (FDI) and bank loans. For\ndeveloped countries, due to the strength of the equity and ﬁxed-income markets,\nstocks and bonds appear to be more important than bank loans and FDI.\nEquity Markets\nEquity markets have a signiﬁcant impact on exchange rate movements because\nthey are a major place for high-volume currency movements. Their importance is\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?42considerable for the currencies of countries with developed capital markets, where\na great amount of capital inﬂows and outﬂows occur, and where foreign investors\nare major participants. The amount of the foreign investment ﬂows in the equity\nmarkets is dependent on the general health and growth of the market, reﬂecting\nthe well-being of companies and particular sectors. Movements of currencies occur\nwhen foreign investors move their money to a particular equity market. Thus,\nthey convert their capital in a domestic currency and push the demand for it\nhigher, making the currency appreciate. When the equity markets are experiencing\nrecessions, however, foreign investors tend to ﬂee, thus converting back to their\nhome currency and pushing the domestic currency down.\nFixed-Income (Bond) Markets\nThe effect that ﬁxed-income markets have on currencies is similar to that of the\nequity markets and is a result of capital movements. An investor’s interest in the\nﬁxed-income market depends on the company’s speciﬁcs and credit rating, as well as\non the general health of the economy and the country’s interest rates. The movement\nof foreign capital into and out of ﬁxed-income markets leads to change in the demand\nand supply for currencies, hence impacting the currencies’ exchange rates.\nSummary of Trade and Capital Flows\nDetermining and understanding a country’s balance of payments is perhaps the\nmost important and useful tool for those interested in fundamental analysis. Any\ninternational transaction gives rise to two offsetting entries: trade ﬂow balance\n(current account) and capital ﬂow balance (capital account). If the trade ﬂow balance\nis a negative outﬂow, the country is buying more from foreigners than it sells\n(imports exceed exports). When it is a positive inﬂow, the country is selling more\nthan it buys (exports exceed imports). The capital ﬂow balance is positive when\nforeign inﬂows of physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed that\ncountry’s outﬂows. A capital ﬂow is negative when a country buys more physical or\nportfolio investments than are sold to foreign investors.\nThese two entries, trade and capital ﬂow, when added together signify a country’s\nbalance of payments. In theory, the two entries should balance and add up to zero\nin order to provide for the maintenance of the status quo in a nation’s economy and\ncurrency rates.\nIn general, countries might experience positive or negative trade, as well as\npositive or negative capital ﬂow balances. In order to minimize the net effect of\nthe two on the exchange rates, a country should try to maintain a balance between\nthe two. For example, in the United States, there is a substantial trade deﬁcit, as\nmore is imported than is exported. When the trade balance is negative, the country\nis buying more from foreigners than it sells, and therefore it needs to ﬁnance its\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?43deﬁcit. This negative trade ﬂow might be offset by a positive capital ﬂow into the\ncountry, as foreigners buy either physical or portfolio investments. Therefore, the\nUnited States seeks to minimize its trade deﬁcit and maximize its capital inﬂows,\nwith hopes that the two will balance out.\nA change in this balance is extremely signiﬁcant and carries ramiﬁcations that\nrun deep into economic policy and currency exchange levels. The net result of the\ndifference between the trade and capital ﬂows, positive or negative, will impact the\ndirection in which the nation’s currency will move. If the overall trade and capital\nbalance is negative, it will result in a depreciation of the nation’s currency, and if\npositive, it will lead to an appreciation of the currency.\nClearly, a change in the balance of payments carries a direct effect for currency\nlevels. It is therefore possible for any investor to observe economic data relating to\nthis balance and interpret the results that will occur. Data relating to capital and\ntrade ﬂows should be followed most closely. For instance, if an analyst observes\nan increase in the U.S. trade deﬁcit and a decrease in the capital ﬂows, a balance\nof payments deﬁcit would occur, and as a result, an investor may anticipate a\ndepreciation of the dollar.\nLimitations of BOP Model\nThe BOP model mainly focuses on traded goods and services, while ignoring\ninternational capital ﬂows. Indeed, international capital ﬂows often dwarfed trade\nﬂows in the currency markets toward the end of the 1990s, and this oftentimes\nbalanced out the current account of debtor nations like the United States.\nFor example, in 1999, 2000, and 2001, the United States maintained a large\ncurrent account deﬁcit while the Japanese ran a large current account surplus.\nHowever, during this same period in time the U.S. dollar rose against the yen even\nthough trade ﬂows were running against the dollar. The reason was that capital ﬂows\nbalanced out trade ﬂows, thus defying the BOP’s forecasting model for a period of\ntime. Indeed, the increase in capital ﬂows has given rise to the asset market model .\nNote: It is probably a misnomer to call this theory the balance of payments theory\nsince it only takes into account the current account balance, not the actual balance\nof payments. However, until the 1990s capital ﬂows played a very small role in the\nworld economy, so the main statistic viewed was the trade balance, which made up\nthe bulk of the balance of payments for most nations.\nPurchasing Power Parity\nThepurchasing power parity (PPP) theory is based on the belief that foreign exchange\nrates should be determined by the relative prices of a similar basket of goods between\ntwo countries. Any change in a nation’s inﬂation rate should be balanced by an\nopposite change in that nation’s exchange rate. Therefore, according to this theory,\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?44when a country’s prices are rising due to inﬂation, that country’s exchange rate\nshould depreciate in order to return to parity.\nPPP’s Basket of Goods\nThe basket of goods and services priced for the PPP exercise is a sample of all goods\nand services covered by GDP. It includes consumer goods and services, government\nservices, equipment goods, and construction projects. More speciﬁcally, consumer\nitems include food, beverages, tobacco, clothing, footwear, rents, water supply,\ngas, electricity, medical goods and services, furniture and furnishings, household\nappliances, personal transport equipment, fuel, transport services, recreational\nequipment, recreational and cultural services, telephone services, education services,\ngoods and services for personal care and household operation, and repair and\nmaintenance services.\nBig Mac Index\nOne of the most well-known examples of PPP is The Economist ’s Big Mac Index. The\nBig Mac PPP calculates the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the\nsame in America as elsewhere. Comparing these with actual rates helps to signal if\na currency is under- or overvalued. As described by The Economist, the index is a\nlightheartedly guide to currency valuation. It was never intended as a precise gauge\nof currency misalignment, but merely a tool to make exchange-rate theory more\ndigestible.\nFor example, in January 2015, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and\nChinese yuan was approximately 6.20. At the time, a Big Mac cost $4.79 in the\nUnited States. In China, the same burger cost 17.15 yuan, or approximately $2.77\nat market exchange. This means that based on the comparison between the two\nburger prices, the Chinese yuan was undervalued by 42%.\nOECD Purchasing Power Parity Index\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) releases a\nmore formal index. Under a joint OECD-Eurostat PPP Program, the OECD and\nEurostat share the responsibility for calculating PPPs. Their latest information on\nwhich currencies are under- or overvalued against the U.S. dollar can be found\non the OECD website at www.oecd.org. The OECD publishes a table that shows\nthe price levels for the major industrialized countries. Each column shows the\nnumber of speciﬁed monetary units needed in each of the countries listed to buy\nthe same representative basket of consumer goods and services. In each case,\nthe representative basket costs a hundred units in the country whose currency is\nspeciﬁed. The chart that is then created compares the PPP of a currency with its\nactual exchange rate. The chart is updated weekly to reﬂect the current exchange\nrate. It is also updated about twice a year to reﬂect new estimates of PPP. The\nPPP estimates are taken from studies carried out by the OECD; however, it should\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?45not be taken as deﬁnitive. Different methods of calculation will arrive at different\nPPP rates.\nAccording to the OECD’s data as of April 17, 2015, the PPP value of the\nAustralian dollar versus the U.S. dollar based on GDP is 0.6712. At the time, the\nAUD/USD exchange rate was 0.7812. Using this model of valuation, this indicates\nthat the Australian dollar was 14% overvalued.\nLimitations to Using Purchasing Power Parity\nPPP theory should only be used for long-term fundamental analysis. While the\neconomic forces behind PPP will eventually equalize the purchasing power of\ncurrencies, this can take many years. A time horizon of 5–10 years is typical.\nPPP’s major weakness is that it assumes goods can be traded easily, without regard\nto such things as tariffs, quotas, or taxes. For example, when the U.S. government\nannounces new tariffs on imported steel, the cost of domestic manufactured goods\ngoes up; but those increases will not be reﬂected in the U.S. PPP tables.\nThere are other factors that must also be considered when weighing PPP: inﬂation,\ninterest rate differentials, economic releases/reports, asset markets, trade ﬂows,\nand political developments. Indeed, PPP is just one of several theories traders should\nuse when determining exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Parity\nThe interest rate parity theory states that if two different currencies have different\ninterest rates, then that difference should be reﬂected in the premium or discount\nfor the forward exchange rate to prevent riskless arbitrage.\nFor example, if U.S. interest rates are 3% and Japanese interest rates are 1%,\nthen the U.S. dollar should depreciate against the Japanese yen by 2% in order\nto prevent riskless arbitrage. This future exchange rate is reﬂected in the forward\nexchange rate stated today. In our example, the forward exchange rate of the dollar\nis said to be at discount because it buys fewer Japanese yen in the forward rate than\nit does in the spot rate. The yen is said to be at a premium.\nInterest rate parity has shown very little proof of effectiveness in recent years.\nOftentimes, currencies with higher interest rates rise and attract incoming invest-\nment, while currencies with low and falling interest rates decline as outﬂows slow.\nThe Monetary Model\nAccording to the monetary model, exchange rates are determined by a nation’s\nmonetary policy. The premise is that countries that follow a stable monetary policy\nover time should have appreciating currencies. Countries that have erratic monetary\npolicies or excessively expansionist policies should see the value of their currency\ndepreciate.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?46How to Use the Monetary Model\nThree factors inﬂuence exchange rates under this theory:\n1. A nation’s money supply\n2. Expected future levels of a nation’s money supply\n3. The growth rate of a nation’s money supply\nAll of these factors are key to understanding and spotting a monetary trend that\nmay force a change in exchange rates. For example, let’s assume that the Japanese\neconomy has been slipping in and out of recession for over a decade. Interest rates\nare near zero and annual budget deﬁcits prevent the Japanese from spending their\nway out of recession, which leaves only one tool left at the disposal of Japanese\nofﬁcials determined to revive Japan’s economy: printing more money. By buying\nstocks and bonds, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is increasing the nation’s money supply,\nwhich produces inﬂation, and this forces a change in the exchange rate. The example\nin Figure 3.5 illustrates the effect of money supply changes to the Japanese yen using\nthe monetary model.\nIndeed, it is in the area of excessive expansionary monetary policy that the\nmonetary model is most successful. One of the only ways a country can keep\nits currency from sharply devaluing is by pursuing a tight monetary policy. For\nexample, during the Asian Currency Crisis, the Hong Kong dollar came under\nattack from speculators. Hong Kong ofﬁcials raised interest rates to 300% to halt\nthe Hong Kong dollar from being dislodged from its peg to the U.S. dollar. The\ntactic worked perfectly, as speculators were cleared out by such sky-high interest\nrates. The downside was that the Hong Kong economy would slide into recession.\nBut in the end, the peg held and the monetary model worked.\nLimitations of the Monetary Model\nVery few economists rely solely on this model because it does not take into account\ntrade ﬂows and capital ﬂows. For example, throughout 2014 Australia had higher\ninterest rates, growth rates, and inﬂation rates than both the United States and the\nEuropean Union, yet, the AUD appreciated in value against both the dollar and the\neuro. Indeed, the monetary model has greatly struggled since the dawn of freely\nCHANGE IN MONEY\nSUPPL Y\nY en Is Printed Increase in Y en Creates\nInflationY en Depreciates in ValueCHANGE IN EXCHANGE\nRATECHANGE IN PRICE\nLEVEL\nFIGURE 3.5 Monetary Model\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?47ﬂoating currencies. The model holds that high interest rates signal growing inﬂation,\nwhich it often does, followed by a depreciating currency. But this does not take into\naccount the capital inﬂows that would take effect as a result of higher interest yields\nor of an equity market that may be thriving in a booming economy—thus causing\nthe currency to possibly appreciate.\nIn any case, the monetary model is one of several valuation tools that can be\nemployed in tandem with other models to determine the direction an exchange rate\nis heading.\nReal Interest Rate Differential Model\nAccording to the real interest rate differential theory, exchange rate movements are\ndetermined by a country’s interest rate. The idea is that countries with high interest\nrates should see their currency appreciate in value, while countries with low interest\nrates should see their currency depreciate in value.\nBasics of the Model\nThe basic premise of the model is that when a country raises its interest rates,\ninternational investors will buy that currency because they ﬁnd its yield more\nattractive. When a country lowers interest rates, they sell the currency. Figure 3.6\nUK\nUKInterest Rates vs. United States Eurozone\nEurozone2003 Percent.

The Australian dollar had the\nlargest basis point spread and also had the highest return against the U.S. dollar,\nwhich seems to vindicate the model, as investors bought up higher-yielding Aussie.\nThe same can be said for the New Zealand dollar, which also had a higher yield\nthan the U.S. dollar and gained 27% against USD. Yet the model becomes less\nconvincing when comparing the euro, which gained 20% against the dollar (more\nthan every currency except NZD), even though its basis point differential was\nonly 100 points. The model then comes under serious question when comparing\nthe British pound and the Japanese yen. The yen differential is –100, and yet it\nappreciated almost 12% against the dollar. Meanwhile, the British pound gained\nonly 11% against the dollar even though it had a whopping 275 point interest rate\ndifferential.\nThis model also stresses that one of the key factors in determining the severity of\nan exchange rate’s response to a shift in interest rates is the expected persistence of\nthat shift. Simply put, a rise in interest rates that is expected to last for ﬁve years\nwill have a much larger impact on the exchange rate than if that rise were expected\nto last for only one year.\nLimitations to the Interest Rate Model\nThere is a great deal of debate among international economists over whether there\nis a strong and statistically signiﬁcant link between changes in a nation’s interest rate\nand currency price. The main weakness of this model is that it does not take into\naccount a nation’s current account balance, relying on capital ﬂows instead. Indeed,\nthe model tends to overemphasize capital ﬂows at the expense of numerous other\nfactors, such as political stability, inﬂation, and poor economic growth. Absent these\ntypes of factors, the model can be very useful, since it is quite logical to conclude\nthat an investor will naturally gravitate toward the investment vehicle that pays a\nhigher reward.\nThe Asset Market Model\nThe basic premise of the asset market model theory is that the ﬂow of funds into the\nﬁnancial assets of a country such as equities and bonds increases the demand for that\ncountry’s currency (and vice versa). As proof, advocates point out that the amount\nof funds that are placed in investment products such as stocks and bonds now dwarf\nthe amount of funds that is exchanged as a result of the transactions in goods and\nservices for import and export purposes. The asset market theory is basically the\nopposite of the balance of payments theory since it takes into account a nation’s\ncapital account instead of its current account.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?49A Dollar-Driven Theory\nThroughout 1999, many experts argued that the dollar would fall against the euro\non the grounds of the expanding U.S. current account deﬁcit and an overvalued\nWall Street. That was based on the rationale that non-U.S. investors would begin\nwithdrawing their funds from U.S. stocks and bonds into more economically sound\nmarkets, which would weigh signiﬁcantly on the dollar. Yet, such fears have lingered\nsince the early 1980s when the U.S. current account soared to a record high 3.5%\nof GDP.\nIn the two decades that followed, the balance of payments approach in assessing\nthe dollar’s behavior has given way to the asset market approach. This theory\ncontinues to hold the most sway over pundits due to the enormity of U.S. capital\nmarkets. In May and June of 2002, the dollar plummeted over 1000 points versus\nthe yen at the same time equity investors ﬂed U.S. equity markets due to the\naccounting scandals that were plaguing Wall Street. As the scandals subsided toward\nthe end of 2002, the dollar rose 500 points from a low of 115.43 to close at 120.00\nagainst the yen, even though the current account balance remained in massive deﬁcit\nthe entire time.\nLimitations to the Asset Market Theory\nIt is frequently argued that over the long run, there is no relationship between\na nation’s equity market performance and the performance of its currency. See\nFigure 3.7 for a comparison.

Only time\nwill tell whether the asset market model will hold up or merely be a short-term blip\non the currency forecasting radar.\nThe Currency Substitution Model\nThe currency substitution model is an enhanced version of the monetary model\nbecause it takes into account investor ﬂows. It posits that the shifting of private\nand public portfolios from one nation to another can have a signiﬁcant effect on\nexchange rates. The ability of individuals to change their assets from domestic and\nforeign currencies is known as currency substitution. When this model is added\nto the monetary model, evidence shows that shifts in expectations of a nation’s\nmoney supply can have a decided impact on that nation’s exchange rates. Simply\nput, investors are looking at monetary model data and coming to the conclusion\nthat a change in money ﬂow is about to occur, thus affecting the exchange rate, so\nthey are investing accordingly, which turns the monetary model into a self-fulﬁlling\nprophecy. Investors who subscribe to this theory are merely jumping on the currency\nsubstitution model bandwagon on the way to the monetary model party.\nThe Yen Example\nIn the monetary model we talked about how the Japanese government was basically\nprinting yen and increasing the money supply when it bought stocks and bonds.\nMonetary model theorists would say that this monetary growth would spark inﬂation\n(more yen chasing fewer products), decrease demand for the yen, and ﬁnally cause\nthe yen to depreciate. A currency substitution theorist would agree with this scenario\nand look to take advantage of this view by shorting the yen, or if they were long\nthe yen promptly getting out of the position. By taking this action, our yen trader\nis helping to drive the market precisely in that direction, thus making the monetary\nmodel theory a fate accompli. The step-by-step process is illustrated in Figure 3.8.\nA. Japan announces new stock and bond buyback plan. Economists are now\npredicting Japan’s money supply will dramatically increase.\nB. Economists are also predicting a rise in inﬂation with the introduction of this\nnew policy. Speculators expect a change in the exchange rate as a result.\nC. Economists expect interest rates to rise and inﬂation takes hold in the economy.\nSpeculators start selling short the yen in anticipation of a change in the exchange\nrate.\nD. Demand for the yen plummets as money ﬂows easily through the Japanese\neconomy and speculators dump yen in the markets.\nE. The exchange rate for the Japanese yen changes dramatically as the yen falls\nin value to foreign currencies, especially those that are easily substituted by\ninvestors (read: liquid yen crosses).\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?51Forecast of\nFuture\nMonetary\nGrowth Forecast of\nFuture InflationChange in\nExchange RateChange in Real\nMoney Demand\nChange in\nExpected\nExchange RateChange in\nDemand for\nForeign Cash\nAB CD EForecast of\nFuture Inflation\nFIGURE 3.8 Currency Substitution Model\nLimitations of the Currency Substitution Model\nAmong the major, actively traded currencies, this model has not yet shown itself\nto be a convincing, single determinant for exchange rate movements. While this\ntheory can be used with more conﬁdence in underdeveloped countries where ‘‘hot\nmoney’’ rushes in and out of emerging markets with enormous effect, there are\nstill too many variables not accounted for by the currency substitution model. For\nexample, using the yen illustration in Figure 3.8, even though Japan may try to spark\ninﬂation with its securities’ buyback plan, it still has an enormous current account\nsurplus that will continually prop up the yen. Also, Japan has numerous political\nlandmines it must avoid in its own neighborhood, and should Japan make it clear\nthat it is trying to devalue its currency, there will be enormous repercussions. These\nare just two of many factors the substitution model does not take into consideration.\nHowever, this model (like numerous other currency models) should be considered\npart of an overall, balanced, FX forecasting diet."

Traditionally, it is the platform through which governments, businesses,\ninvestors, travelers, and other interested parties convert or ‘‘exchange’’ currency.\nAt its most fundamental level, the foreign exchange market is an over-the-counter\n(OTC) market with no central exchange and clearing house where orders are\nmatched. FX dealers and market makers around the world are linked to each other\naround-the-clock via telephone, computer, and fax, creating one cohesive market.\nThrough the years, this has changed with many institutions offering exchange traded\nFX instruments, but all of the prices are still derived from the underlying or spot\nforex market.\nIn the past two decades, foreign exchange, also known as forex orFX,became\navailable to trade by individual retail investors, and this access caused the market\nto explode in popularity. In the early 2000s, the Bank of International Settlements\nreported a 57% increase in volume between Ap ril 2001 and 2004. At the time more\nthan $1.9 trillion were changing hands on a daily basis. After the ﬁnancial crisis in\n2008, the pace of growth eased to a still- respectable 32% between 2010 and 2013,\nbut the actual volume that changed hands was signiﬁcantly larger at an average of\n$5.3 trillion per day. To put this into perspective, it is 50 times greater than the\ndaily trading volume of the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ combined.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET2While the growth of the retail foreign exchange market contributed to this surge\nin volume, an increase in volatility over the past few years also made investors\nmore aware of how currency movements can impact the equity and bond markets.\nIf stocks, bonds, and commodity traders want to make more educated trading\ndecisions, it is important for them to also follow forex movements. What follows\nare some of the examples of how currency ﬂuctuations impacted stock and bond\nmarket movements in past years.\n■EURUSD and Corporate Proﬁtability\nFor stock market traders, particularly those who invest in European corporations that\nexport a tremendous amount of goods to the United States, monitoring exchange\nrates are essential to predicting earnings and corporate proﬁtability. Throughout 2003\nand 2004, European manufacturers complained extensively about the rapid rise in the\neuro and the weakness in the U.S. dollar. The main culprit for the dollar’s selloff at\nthe time was the country’s rapidly growing trade and budget deﬁcits. This caused the\nEURUSD exchange rate to surge, which took a signiﬁcant toll on the proﬁtability of\nEuropean corporations because a higher exchange rate makes the goods of European\nexporters more expensive to U.S. consumers. In 2003, inadequate hedging shaved\napproximately EUR$1 billion euros from Volkswagen’s proﬁts, while DSM, a Dutch\nchemicals group, warned that a 1% move in the EURUSD rate would reduce proﬁts\nby EUR$7 million to EUR$11 million. Unfortunately, inadequate hedging is still a\nreality in Europe, which makes monitoring the EURUSD exchange rate even more\nimportant in forecasting the earnings and proﬁtability of European exporters.\n■Nikkei and U.S. Dollar\nTraders exposed to Japanese equities also need to be aware of the developments\nthat are occurring in the U.S. dollar and ho w that affects the Nikkei rally. Japan\nrecently came out of 10 years of stagnation. During this time, mutual funds and\nhedge funds were grossly underweight Japanese equities. When the economy began\nto turn around, global macro funds rushed to make changes to their portfolios in fear\nof missing out on a great opportunity to take advantage of Japan’s recovery. Hedge\nfunds borrowed signiﬁcant amount of dollars to pay for increased exposure, but the\nproblem was that their borrowings were very sensitive to U.S. interest rates and the\nFed’s monetary policy tightening cycle. Increased borrowing costs forthe dollar could\nderail the Nikkei’s rally because higher rates will raise the dollar’s ﬁnancing costs. Yet\nwith the huge current account deﬁcit, the Fed might need to continue raising rates\nto increase the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Therefore, continual\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET3rate hikes, coupled with slowing growth in Japan, may make it less proﬁtable for\nfunds to be overleveraged and overly exposed to Japanese stocks. As a result, how\nthe U.S. dollar moves also plays a role on the future direction of the Nikkei.\n■George Soros\nKnown as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England,’’ George Soros is one of\nthe most well-known traders in the FX market. We discuss his adventures in\nmore detail in Chapter 2, but in a nutshell, in 1990, England decided to join\nthe Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) system because it wanted to take part in\nthe stable and low-inﬂation environment created by the Bundesbank, the central\nbank of Germany. This alliance tied the pound to the deutschmark, which meant\nthat the United Kingdom was subject to the monetary policies enforced by the\nBundesbank. In the early 1990s, Germany aggressively increased interest rates to\navoid the inﬂationary effects related to German reuniﬁcation. However, national\npride and the commitment of ﬁxing exchange rates within the ERM prevented\nEngland from devaluing the pound. On Wednesday, September 16, also known as\nBlack Wednesday, George Soros leveraged the entire value of his fund ($1 billion) and\nsold $10 billion worth of pounds to bet against the ERM. This essentially ‘‘broke’’\nthe Bank of England and forced it to devalue the pound. In a matter of 24 hours, the\nBritish pound fell approximately 5%, or 5000 pips. The Bank of England promised\nto raise rates in order to tempt speculators to buy pounds. As a result, this caused\ntremendous volatility in the bond markets, with 1-month UK LIBOR rates rising\n1% and then retracing those gains over the next 24 hours. If bond traders were\ncompleted oblivious to what was going on in the currency markets, they would have\nprobably found themselves dumbstruck in face of such rapid gyration in yields.\n■Chinese Yuan Revaluation and Bonds\nFor Treasury traders, there’s another currency-related issue that is important to\nfollow and that is the gradual revaluation of the Chinese yuan. For most of its history,\nthe yuan or renminbi (RMB) was pegged to the U.S. dollar. In the 1980s, the RMB\nwas devalued to promote growth in C hina’s economy, and between 1997 and 2005\nthe People’s Bank of China artiﬁcially maintained a USDRMB rate of 8.27. At the\ntime, it received signiﬁcant criticism because keeping the peg meant that the Chinese\ngovernment would artiﬁcially weaken its currency to make Chinese goods more\ncompetitive. To maintain the band, the Chinese government had to sell the yuan and\nbuy U.S. dollars each time their currency appreciated above the band’s upper limit.\nThese dollars were then used to purchase U.S. Treasuries, and this practice turned\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET4China into the world’s largest holder of U.S. Treasuries. In 2005, however, China\nended its dollar peg and linked the value of the yuan to a basket of currencies and\nallowed it to ﬂuctuate within a narrow band that was reset every day. While the exact\npercentage of the basket is unknown, it is largely dominated by the U.S. dollar and\nincludes other currencies such as the euro, Japanese yen, South Korean won, British\npound, Thai baht, Russian ruble, and Australian, Canadian, and Singapore dollar.\nThrough the years China has gradually widened the band that the yuan can trade\nin, but if China were to end the ﬂoat and allow the RMB to trade freely on the\nglobal foreign exchange market, the impact on the ﬁxed-income markets would be\nsigniﬁcant because it would reduce the government’s need to purchase Treasuries\nand other ﬁxed-income securities. An announcement of this sort would send yields\nsoaring and prices tumbling. While it could be years before this happens, it will be\nimportant for bond investors to follow these developments if they want to effectively\nmanage the risk.\n■Comparing the FX Market with Futures\nand Equities\nThe foreign exchange market has not always been a popular market to trade because\nfor many decades, it was restricted to hedge funds, commodity trading advisers who\nmanage large amounts of capital, major corporations, and institutional investors\ndue to regulation, capital requirements, and technology. Yet it was the market\nof choice for many of these large players because the risk was fully customizable.\nTrader A could use a 50 times leverage, and Trader B could trade cash on cash.\nWhen the market opened up to retail traders, many brokerage ﬁrms swept in to\nprovide leveraged trading along with free instantaneous execution platforms, charts,\nand real-time news. This access to low-cost information helped foreign exchange\ntrading surge in popularity, increasing its attractiveness as an alternative asset class\nto trade.\nMany equity and futures traders also turned to currencies, adding the asset class\nto their trading portfolios. Before you choose to do so, however, it is important to\nunderstand some of the key difference s between the forex and equity markets.\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs, and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET5Characteristics of Equities Market\n1. There is decent market liquidity, but that can depend on a stock’s daily volume.\n2. The market is only available for trading 9:30am to 5pm NY Time, with limited\nafter-hours trading.\n3. The existence of exchange fees results in higher costs and commissions.\n4. There is an uptick rule to short stocks, which many day traders ﬁnd frustrating.\n5. The number of steps involved in completing a trade can increase slippage and\nerror.\nAs one of the most liquid markets in the world, the volume and liquidity present in\nthe FX markets has allowed traders to access a 24-hour market with low transaction\ncosts, high leverage, the ability to proﬁt in both bull and bear markets, minimized\nerror rates, limited slippage, and no trading curbs or uptick rules. Oftentimes, traders\ncan use the same strategies for analyzing the equity markets in the FX market. Funda-\nmental traders will ﬁnd that countries can be analyzed like stocks. Technical traders\nwill ﬁnd that the FX market is perfect for their style of analysis because of the abun-\ndance of tick data and because it is already one of the most commonly used analysis\ntools by professional traders. Now let’s take a closer look at the individual attributes\nof the FX market to really understand why this is such an attractive market to trade!\n24-Hour Market\nOne of the primary reasons why the FX market is popular is because for active\ntraders, it is the ideal market to trade. It’s 24-hour nature offers traders instant access\nto the markets at all hours of the day for immediate response to global developments.\nThis characteristic also gives traders the added ﬂexibility of determining their own\ntrading day. Active day traders no longer have to wait for the equities market to\nopen at 9:30am NY Time to begin trading. If there is a signiﬁcant announcement or\ndevelopment either domest ically or overseas bet ween 4pm NY Time and 9:30am\nNY Time, most day traders will have to wait for the exchanges to open at 9:30am\nto place trades. In all likelihood, by that time, unless you have access to electronic\ncommunication networks (ECNs) such as Instinet for premarket trading, the market\nwould have gapped up or gapped down against your favor. This is particularly\nfrustrating when important data are released at 8:30am NY Time, such as nonfarm\npayrolls. Professionals would have already priced in the outcome before the average\ntrader can even access to market.\nIn addition, many people who want to trade also have a full-time job during\nthe day. The ability to trade after hours makes the FX market a much more\nconvenient market for all traders. Different times of the day will offer different\ntrading opportunities, as the global ﬁnancial centers around the world are all actively\ninvolved in foreign exchange. With the FX m arket, trading after hours with a large\nonline FX broker provides the same liquidity and spread as any other time of day.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET6As a guideline, at 5pm Sunday NY Time, trading begins as the markets open in\nSydney, Australia. Then, the Tokyo markets open at 7 pm NY Time. Next, Singapore\nand Hong Kong open at 9pm NY Time followed by the European markets in Frankfurt\n(2am) and then London (3am). By 4am the European markets are in full swing, and\nAsia has concluded their trading day. The U.S. markets open ﬁrst in New York around\n8am Monday as Europe winds down. By 5pm, Sydney is set to reopen once again.\nThe majority of trading activity happens when the markets overlap; for example,\nAsia and Europe trading overlaps between 12am to approximately 2am, Europe and\nthe United States overlaps between 8a m to approximately 12pm NY Time, while\nthe United States and Asia overlap be tween 5pm and 9pm. During New York and\nLondon hours, all currency pairs trade actively. During the Asian hours, however,\nthe trading activity for pairs such as the GBPJPY and AUDJPY tend to peak.\nLower Transaction Costs\nLower transaction costs also makes forex an attractive asset class to trade. In the\nequity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission and with online\nequity brokers, commissions can run upwards of $20 per trade. This means that for\npositions of $100,000, average roundtrip commissions could be as high as $120.\nThe over the counter (OTC) structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which, in turn, lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Equity traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade for\nshort-term traders. For an active equity trader who typically places 30 trades a day,\nat $20 commission per trade, you would have to up to pay $600 in daily transaction\ncosts. This is a signiﬁcant amount of money that could take a large cut out of proﬁts\nor deepen losses. The reason why costs are so high is because there are a lot of\npeople involved in an equity transaction. More speciﬁcally, for each trade, there is\na broker, the exchange, and the specialist. All of these parties need to be paid, and\ntheir payment comes in the form of commission and clearing fees. In the FX market,\nbecause it is decentralized with no exchange or clearinghouse (everything is taken\ncare of by the market maker), these fees are not applicable.\nCustomizable Leverage\nEven though many people realize that higher leverage comes with risks, traders are\nhumans, and few of them ﬁnd it easy to turn away the opportunity to trade on\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET7someone else’s money. The FX market caters perfectly to these traders by offering\nthe highest leverage available for any market. Most online currency ﬁrms offer 50\ntimes leverage on regular-sized accounts and up to 200 times leverage on miniature\naccounts (abroad leverage can be as high as 400 times). Compare that to the 2 times\nleverage offered to the average equity investor and the 10 times capital that is\ntypically offered to the professional trader, and you can see why many traders have\nturned to the foreign exchange market. The margin deposit for leverage in the FX\nmarket is not seen as a down payment on a purchase of equity, as many perceive\nmargins to be in the stock markets. Rather, the margin is a performance bond, or\ngood-faith deposit, to ensure against trading losses. This is very useful to short-term\nday traders who need the enhancement in capital to generate quick returns. For the\nmore risk-averse investor, leverage is completely customizable, which means that\nif they only feel comfortable with 10 or 20 times leverage or no leverage at all,\nthey can elect to do so. It is extremely important to understand that leverage is a\ndouble-edged sword—it can magnify proﬁts but also losses.\nProﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nIn the FX market, proﬁt potentials exist in both bull and bear markets. Since\ncurrency trading always involves buying one currency and selling another, there\nis no structural bias to the market. Therefore, if you are long one currency, you\nare at the same time short another. As a result, equal proﬁt potential exists in\nboth upward-trending and downward-trending markets. This is different from the\nequities market, where most traders go long instead of short stocks, so the general\nequity investment community tends to suffer in a bear market.\nNo Trading Curbs or Uptick Rule\nThe FX market is the largest market in the world, forcing market makers to offer\nvery competitive prices. Unlike the equities market, there is never a time in the\nFX markets when trading curbs would take into effect and trading would be halted,\nonly to gap when reopened. This eliminates missed proﬁts due to archaic exchange\nregulations. In the FX market, traders would be able to place trades 24 hours a day\nwith virtually no disruptions.\nOne of the biggest annoyances for day trades in the equity market is the fact\nthat traders are prohibited from shorting a stock in a downtrend unless there is an\nuptick. This can be very frustrating as traders wait to join short sellers, but are only\nleft with continually watching the stock trend down before an uptick occurs. In the\nFX market, there is no such rule. If you want to short a currency pair, you can do\nso immediately; this allows for instant and efﬁcient execution.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET8Online Trading Reducing Error Rates\nA shorter trade process minimizes errors. Online currency trading is typically a\nthree-step process. A trader would place an order on the platform, the FX dealing\ndesk would automatically execute it electronically, and the order conﬁrmation\nwould be posted or logged onto the trader’s trading station. Typically, these three\nsteps would be completed in a matter of seconds. For an equities trade on the other\nhand, there is generally a ﬁve-step process. The client would call his broker to place\nan order, the broker sends the order to the exchange ﬂoor, the specialist on the\nﬂoor tries to match up orders (the broker competes with other brokers to get the\nbest ﬁll for the client), the specialist executes the trade, and the client receives a\nconﬁrmation from the broker. The elimination of a middleman minimizes the error\nrates in currency trades and increases the efﬁciency of each transaction.\nLimited Slippage\nUnlike the equity markets, many online FX market makers provide instantaneous\nexecution from real-time, two-way quotes. These quotes are the prices where the\nﬁrms are willing to buy or sell the quoted currency, rather than vague indications\nof where the market is trading, which may or may not be honored. Orders are\nexecuted and conﬁrmed within seconds. Robust systems would never request the\nsize of a trader’s potential order, or which side of the market he’s trading, before\ngiving him a bid/offer quote. Inefﬁcient dealers determine whether the investor is a\nbuyer or a seller, and shade the price to increase their own proﬁt on the transaction.\nThe equity market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’ system, under\nwhich you may not get executed at the price you wish, but rather at the next best\nprice available. For example, let’s say Microsoft is trading at $52.50. If you enter a\nbuy order at this rate, by the time it reaches the specialist on the exchange ﬂoor, the\nprice may have risen to $53.25. In this case, you will not get executed at $52.50;\nyou will get executed at $53.25, which is essentially a loss of 3∕4of a point. The\nprice transparency provided by the some of the better market makers assures that\ntraders always receive a fair price.\nPerfect Market for Technical Analysis\nFor technical analysts, currencies rarely spend much time in tight trading ranges and\nhave the tendency to develop strong trends. Over 80% of volume is speculative in\nnature and as a result, the market frequently overshoots and then corrects itself.\nHence, technical analysis works well for the FX market, and a technically trained\ntrader can easily identify new trends and breakouts, which provide multiple oppor-\ntunities to enter and exit positions. Charts and indicators are used by all professional\nFX market traders, and candle charts are available on most charting packages. In addi-\ntion, the most commonly used indicators such as Fibonacci retracements, stochastics,\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET9MACD, moving averages, RSI, and support/resistance levels have proven valid in\nmany instances.\nIn the USDJPY chart shown in Figure 1.1, it is clear that Fibonacci retracements,\nmoving averages, and stochastics have at one point or another given successful\ntrading signals. For example, the 61.8% retracement level served as resistance for\nUSDJPY in December 2014, January 2015, and February 2015. The moving-average\ncrossovers of the 10- and 20-day simple moving averages also successfully forecasted\nthe rally in USDJPY in late October, along with the decline in early January. Equity\ntraders who focus on technical analysis have the easiest transition, since they can\nimplement the same technical strategies that they use in the equities market into the\nFX market.\nAnalyze Stocks Like Countries\nTrading currencies is not a big challenge for fundamental traders either, because\ncountries can be analyzed like stocks. For example, if you analyze growth rates of\nstocks, you can use gross domestic product (GDP) to analyze the growth rate of\ncountries. If you analyze inventory and production ratios, you can follow industrial\nproduction (IP) or durable goods data. If you follow sales ﬁgures, you can analyze\nretail sales data. As with a stock investme n t ,i ti sb e t t e rt oi n v e s ti nt h ec u r r e n c yo fa\ncountry that is growing faster and fund it with a currency of a country that is growing\nslower. Currency prices reﬂect the balance of supply and demand for currencies.\nTwo of the primary factors affecting supply and demand of currencies are interest\nrates and the overall strength of the economy. Economic indicators such as GDP,\nforeign investment, and the trade balance reﬂect the general health of an economy\nand are therefore responsible for the underlying shifts in supply and demand for\nthat currency. There is a tremendous amount of data released at regular intervals,\nsome of which are more important than others. Data related to interest rates and\ninternational trade is the most closely followed.\nIf there is uncertainty regarding the direction of interest rates, any bit of news\non monetary policy can directly affect how the currency trades. Traditionally,\nif a country raises its interest rate, the currency of that country will strengthen\nin relation to other countries as investors shift assets to that country to gain a\nhigher return. In contrast, an interest rates hike is generally bad news for stocks\nbecause it means that borrowing costs have risen. In response, some investors will\ntransfer money out of a country’s stock market when interest rates are increased,\ncausing the country’s currency to weaken. Determining which effect dominates can\nbe tricky, but generally there is an advance consensus on how interest rates will\nmove. Indicators that have the biggest impact on interest rates are producer prices,\nconsumer prices, employment, spending, and GDP. Most of the time monetary\npolicy announcements are known in advance with meeting dates by the Bank of\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET10\nFIGURE 1.1 USDJPY Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET11England (BoE), the Federal Reserve (FED), European Central Bank (ECB), Bank\nof Japan (BoJ), and other central banks posted on their respective websites.\nAnother piece of data that can impact how currencies move is the trade balance,\nwhich shows the net differ ence over a period of time b etween a nation’s exports and\nimports. When a country imports more than it exports, the trade balance will show\na deﬁcit, which is generally considered unfavorable. For example, if U.S. dollars are\nsold for other domestic national currencies (to pay for imports), the ﬂow of dollars\noutside the country will depreciate the value of the dollar. Similarly, if trade ﬁgures\nshow an increase in exports, dollars will ﬂow into the United States and appreciate\nthe value of the dollar. From the standpoint of a national economy, a deﬁcit in and of\nitself is not necessarily a bad thing. If the deﬁcit is greater than market expectations\nhowever, it can trigger a negative price movement.\n■FX versus Futures\nTrading spot forex is also different from trading futures, and like equity traders,\nmany futures traders have also added currency spot trading into their portfolios. We\nknow that the spot forex market has the following attributes:\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nCharacteristics of Futures Markets\n1. There is limited market liquidity depending on the month of contract trades.\n2. The presence of exchange fees results in more costs and commissions.\n3. Market hours for futures trading are much shorter than spot and are dependent\non the product traded; each product may have different open and closing hours,\nand there is limited after-hours trading.\n4. Futures leverage is higher than equities, but still only a fraction of the leverage\noffered in FX.\n5. There tends to be prolonged bear markets.\n6. Pit trading structure increases error and slippage.\nLike in the equities market, traders can implement the same strategies they use\nin analyzing the futures markets in the FX m arket. Most future tr aders are technical\ntraders, and the FX market is perfect for technical analysis. In fact, it is the most\npopular analysis technique used by professional FX traders. Taking a closer look at\nhow the futures market stacks up, we see the following.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET12Comparing Market Hours and Liquidity\nThe volume traded in the FX market is estimated to be over ﬁve times that of the\nfutures market. The FX market is open for trading 24 hours a day, but the futures\nmarket has confusing market hours which vary based on the product traded. For\nexample, if you traded gold futures, it is only open for trading between 7:20am\nand 1:30pm on the COMEX. If you traded crude oil futures on the New York\nMercantile Exchange, t rading would only be ope n between 8:30am. and 2:10pm.\nThese varying hours not only create confusion but also makes it difﬁcult to act on\nbreakthrough announcements throughout the reminder of the day.\nIn addition, if you have a day job and can only trade after hours, futures would be\na very inconvenient market product to trade. You would basically be placing orders\nbased on past prices that are not current market prices. This lack of transparency\nmakes trading very cumbersome. In addition, each time zone has its own unique\nnews and developments that could move speciﬁc currency pairs, and with futures it\ncan difﬁcult to act on breaking overnight news.\nLow to Zero Transaction Costs\nIn the equity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission. With future\nbrokers, average commissions can run close to $160 per trade on positions of\n$100,000 or greater. The OTC structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which can in turn lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight,\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Futures traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow to zero transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade\nfor short-term traders. If you are an active futures trader who typically places 20\ntrades a day, at $100 commission per trade, you would have to pay $2,000 in daily\ntransaction costs. A typical futures trade involves a broker, a future commissions\nmerchant (FCM) order desk, a clerk on the exchange ﬂoor, a runner, and a pit\ntrader. All of these parties need to be paid, and their payment comes in the form of\ncommission and clearing fees, whereas the electronic nature of the market minimizes\nthese costs.\nNo Limit Up or Down Rules/Proﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nUnlike the tight restriction on the futures market, there is no limit down or limit\nup rule in the FX market. For example, on the S&P index futures, if the contract\nvalue falls more than 5% from the previous day’s close, limit down rules will come\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET13in effect, whereby on a 5% move, the index would only be allowed to trade at\nor above this level for the next 10 minutes. For a 20% decline, trading would be\ncompletely halted. Due to the decentralized nature of the FX market, there are no\nexchange-enforced restrictions on daily activity, which can help eliminate missed\nopportunities caused by archaic exchange regulations.\nExecution Quality and Speed/Low Error Rates\nThe futures market is also known for inconsistent execution, both in terms of pricing\nand execution time. Every futures trader has, at some point in time, experienced\na half hour or so wait for a market order to be ﬁlled, only to ﬁnd that the order\nhas been executed at a price far away from where the market was trading when\nthe initial order was placed. Even with electronic trading and limited guarantees of\nexecution speed, the price for ﬁlls on market orders is far from certain. The reason\nfor this inefﬁciency is the number of steps that are involved in placing a futures\ntrade. A futures trade is typically a seven-step process:\n1. The client calls his broker and places his trade (or places it online).\n2. The trading desk receives the order, processes it, and routes it to the FCM\norder desk on the exchange ﬂoor.\n3. The FCM order desk passes the order to the order clerk.\n4. The order clerk hands the order to a runner or signals it to the pit.\n5. The trading clerk goes to the pit to execute the trade.\n6. The trade conﬁrmation goes to the runner or is signaled to the order clerk and\nprocessed by the FCM order desk.\n7. The broker receives the trade conﬁrmation and passes it on to the client.\nAn FX trade in comparison is typically only a three-step process. A trader would\nplace an order on the platform, the FX dealing desk would automatically execute\nit electronically, and the order conﬁrmation would be posted or logged on the\ntrader’s trading station. The elimination of the involvement of these additional\nparties increases the speed of the trade execution and decreases errors.\nIn addition, the futures market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’\nsystem, under which your trades frequently do not get executed at the initial market\norder price, but rather, at the next best price available. For example, let’s say a\nclient is long 5 March Dow Jones futures contracts at 8800. If the client enters a\nstop order at 8700, when the rate reaches this level, the client will most likely be\nexecuted at 8690. This 10-point difference would be attributed to slippage, which\nis very common in the futures market.\nOn most FX trading stations, traders execute directly off of real-time streaming\nprices. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, there is generally no discrepancy\nbetween the displayed price and the execution price. This holds true even during\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET14volatile times and fast-moving markets. In the futures market, execution is uncertain\nbecause all orders must be done on the exchange. This creates a situation where\nliquidity is limited by the number of participants, which, in turn, limits quantities\nthat can be traded at a given price. Real-time streaming prices ensure that market\norders, stops, and limits are executed with minimal slippage and no partial ﬁlls.\n■W h oA r et h eP l a y e r si nt h eF XM a r k e t ?\nSince the foreign exchange market is an OTC market without a centralized exchange,\ncompetition between market makers prohibits monopolisti c pricing strategies. If\none market maker attempts to drastically skew the price, then traders simply have\nthe option to ﬁnd another market maker. Moreover, spreads are closely watched to\nensure market makers are not whimsically altering the cost of the trade. Many equity\nmarkets, on the other hand, operate in a completely different fashion; the New York\nStock Exchange, for instance, is the sole place where companies listed on the NYSE\ncan have their stocks traded. Centralized markets are operated by what are referred\nto as specialists. Market makers, on the other hand, is the term used in reference to\ndecentralized marketplaces. Since the NYSE is a centralized market, a stock traded\non the NYSE can only have one bid–ask quote at all times. Decentralized markets,\nsuch as foreign exchange, can have multiple market makers—all of whom have the\nright to quote different prices. Here is an illustration of how both centralized and\ndecentralized markets operate.\nCentralized Markets\nBy their very nature, centralized markets tend to be monopolistic: With a single\nspecialist controlling th e market, prices can easil y be skewed to a ccommodate the\ninterests of the specialist, not those of the traders (see Figure 1.2). If, for example,\nthe market is ﬁlled with sellers that the specialists must buy from but no prospective\nbuyers on the other side, the specialist may simply widen the spread, thereby\nBuyers\nCan buy only\nfrom one\nspecialistSpecialist\nUnites buyers and\nsellers; maintains\nsole control over\nthe spreadSellers\nCan sell only to\none specialist\nFIGURE 1.2 Centralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET15increasing the cost of the trade and preventing additional participants from entering\nthe market. Or, specialists can drastically alter the quotes they are offering, thus\nmanipulating the price to accommodate their own risk tolerance.\nHierarchy of Participants\nWhile the foreign exchange market is decentralized, and hence employs multiple\nmarket makers rather than a single specialist, participants in the FX market are\norganized into a hierarchy; those with superior credit access, volume transacted,\nand sophistication receive priority pricing in the market (see Figure 1.3). At the\ntop of the food chain is the interbank market, which trades the highest volume per\nday in relatively few currencies. In the interbank market, the largest banks can deal\nwith each other directly, via interbank brokers, or through electronic brokering\nsystems like EBS or Reuters. The interbank market is a credit-approved system,\nwhere banks trade based solely on the credit relationships they have established\nwith one another. The banks can see the rates everyone is dealing at, but each bank\nmust have a speciﬁc credit relationship with that bank in order to trade at the rates\nbeing offered. Other institutions such as online FX market makers, hedge funds,\nand corporations must trade FX through these banks, although some have created\ntheir own liquidity pools through the years. Many banks (e.g., small community\nbanks or banks in emerging markets), corporations, and institutional investors do\nnot have access to these rates because they have no established credit lines with\nbig banks. This forces smaller participants to deal through just one bank for their\nRetail Clients\nTrader\nTrader\nTrader\nTraderOnline TradingInterbank Market\nBank Bank\nBank BankEBS and\nReutersOnline FX\nMarket\nMakers\nFIGURE 1.3 Decentralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET16foreign exchange needs, and oftentimes this means much less competitive rates for\nthe participants further down the participant hierarchy. Those receiving the least\ncompetitive rates are customers of banks and physical currency exchange companies.\nRecently, technology has broken down the barriers that used to stand between the\nend-users of foreign exchange services and the interbank market. The online trading\nrevolution opened its doors to retail clientele by connecting market makers and\nmarket participants in an efﬁcient, low-cost manner. In essence, online trading\nplatforms serve as a gateway to the liquid FX market. Average traders can now\ntrade alongside the biggest banks in the world, with virtually similar pricing and\nexecution. What used to be a game dominated and controlled by the ‘‘big boys’’ is\nslowly becoming a level playing ﬁeld where individuals can proﬁt and take advantage\nof the same opportunities as big banks. FX is no longer an old boys club, which\nmeans opportunities abound for aspiring online currency traders.\nDealing Stations— Interbank Market\nFor serious traders who want to know more about the interbank market, the\nmajority of FX volume is actually transacted primarily through the interbank\nmarket. The leading banks of the world trade with each other electronically\nover two platforms—the EBS and Reuters, dealing 3000-spot matching. Both\nplatforms offer trading in the major currency pairs; however, certain currency\npairs are more liquid and generally more frequently traded over one versus the\nother. Some cross-currency pairs are traded over these platforms as well, but\nothers are calculated from the rates of the major currency pairs and are then offset\nusing the ‘‘legs.’’ For example, if an interbank trader had a client who wanted to\ngo long NZDCAD, the trader would most likely buy NZDUSD and USDCAD\nseparately. The trader would then multiply these rates and provide the client with\nthe respective NZDCAD rate, creating a synthetic quote and trade.\n17CHAPTER 2\nHistorical Events in\nthe FX Markets\nBefore learning how to trade currencies, it is important for every new and\nseasoned market participant to have some understanding about the most\nimportant historical events that have shaped the currency market. To this day, these\nevents are often referenced by professional traders.\n■Bretton Woods: Anointing the Dollar as the World\nCurrency (1944)\nIn July 1944, representatives of 44 nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire,\nto create a new institutional arrangement for governing the international economy\nin the years following World War II. Most agreed that international economic\ninstability was one of the principle causes of the war, and that such instability needed\nto be prevented in the future. The agreement, which was developed by renowned\neconomists John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White, was initially proposed\nto Great Britain as a part of the Lend Lease Act—an American act designed to assist\nGreat Britain in postwar redevelopment efforts. After various negotiations, the ﬁnal\nform of the Bretton Woods Agreement consisted of three key items:\n1. The formation of key international authorities designed to promote fair trade\nand international economic harmony\n2. The ﬁxation of exchange rates between currencies\n3. The convertibility between gold and t he U.S. dollar, thus empowering the U.S.\ndollar as the reserve currency of choice for the world\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS18Of these three parameters, only the ﬁrst is still in existence today, but the\norganizations formed as a direct result of Bretton Woods include the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT); and they all play a crucial role in modern day development and regulation\nof international economies. Since the demise of Bretton Woods, the IMF has\nworked closely with the World Bank. Toge ther, the two institutions now regularly\nlend funds to developing nations, assisting them in the development of a public\ninfrastructure capable of supporting a sound mercantile economy that can contribute\nin the international arena. In order to ensure that these nations can actually enjoy\nequal and legitimate access to trade with their industrialized counterparts, the World\nBank and IMF must work closely with GATT. While GATT was initially meant to\nbe a temporary organization, it now operates to encourage the dismantling of trade\nbarriers—namely, tariffs and quotas.\nThe Bretton Woods Agreement existed from 1944 to 1971, after which it\nwas replaced by the Smithsonian Agreement, an international contract pioneered\nby U.S. President Richard Nixon out the necessity to accommodate for Bretton\nWoods’ shortcomings. Unfortunately, the Smithsonian Agreement possessed the\nsame critical weakness: While it did not include gold/U.S. dollar convertibility,\nit maintained ﬁxed exchange rates—a facet that did not accommodate the United\nStates’ ongoing trade deﬁcit and the international need for a weaker U.S. dollar. As\na result, the Smithsonian Agreement was short-lived.\nUltimately, the exchange rates of t he world evolved into a free market,\nwhere supply and demand were the sole criteria that determined the value of a\ncurrency. While this did and still does result in a number of currency crises and\ngreater volatility between currencies, it also allowed the market to become self-\nregulating, and thus could dictate the appropriate value of a currency without any\nhindrances.\nAs for Bretton Woods, perhaps its most memorable contribution to the interna-\ntional economic arena was its role in changing the international perception about the\nU.S. dollar. While the euro is a revolutionary currency blazing new frontiers in both\nsocial behavior and international trade, the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve\ncurrency of choice. This is due, in large part, to the Bretton Woods Agreement:\nBy establishing dollar/gold convertibility, the dollar’s role as the world’s most\naccessible and reliable currency was ﬁrmly cemented. So while Bretton Woods\nmight be a doctrine of yesteryear, its impact on the U.S. dollar and international\neconomics still resonates today.\n■The End of Bretton Woods: Free Market\nCapitalism Is Born (1971)\nOn August 15, 1971, it became ofﬁcial: The Bretton-Woods system was abandoned\nonce and for all. While it had been exorcised before—only to subsequently emerge\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS19in a new form—this ﬁnal eradication of the Bretton Woods system was truly its\nlast stand: No longer would currencies be ﬁxed in value to gold, allowed only to\nﬂuctuate in a 1% range, but instead, their fair valuation could be determined by\nfree-market behavior such as trade ﬂows and foreign direct investment.\nAlthough U.S. President Nixon was conﬁdent that the end of the Bretton Woods\nsystem would bring about better times for the international economy, he was\nnot a believer that the free market could dictate a currency’s true valuation in a\nfair and catastrophe-free manner. Nixon and many well-respected economists at\nthe time reasoned that an entirely unstructured foreign exchange market would\nresult in competing devaluations, which, in turn, would lead to the breakdown of\ninternational trade and investment. The end result, Nixon and his board of economic\nadvisors argued, would be global depression.\nIn response, the Smithsonian Agreement was introduced a few months later.\nHailed by President Nixon as the ‘‘greatest monetary agreement in the history of\nthe world,’’ the Smithsonian Agreement strived to maintain ﬁxed exchange rates\nwithout the backing of gold. Its key difference from the Bretton Woods system was\nthat the value of the dollar could ﬂoat in a range of 2.25%, compared to just 1%\nunder Bretton Woods.\nUltimately, the Smithsonian Agreement proved to be unfeasible as well. Without\nexchange rates ﬁxed to gold, the free market gold price shot up to $215 per\nounce. Moreover, the U.S. trade deﬁcit continued to grow, and from a fundamental\nstandpoint, the U.S. dollar needed to be devalued beyond the 2.25% parameters\nestablished by the Smithsonian Agreement. In light of these problems, the foreign\nexchange markets were forced to close in February 1972.\nThe markets reopened in March 1973, and this time, they were not bound by a\nSmithsonian Agreement: The value of the US dollar was to be determined entirely\nby the market, as its value was not ﬁxed to any commodity, nor was its exchange rate\nﬂuctuation conﬁned to certain parameters. While this did provide the U.S. dollar,\nand other currencies by default, the agility required to adapt to a new and rapidly\nevolving international trading environment, it also set the stage for unprecedented\ninﬂation. The end of Bretton Woods and the Smithsonian Agreement, as well as\nconﬂicts in the Middle East, resulted in substantially higher oil prices and helped\nto create stagﬂation—the synthesis of unemployment and inﬂation—in the U.S.\neconomy. It would not be until later in the decade, when Federal Reserve Chairman\nPaul Volcker initiated new economic policies and President Reagan introduced a new\nﬁscal agenda, that the U.S. dollar would return to ‘‘normal’’ valuations. By then,\nthe foreign exchange markets had thoroughly developed and were capable of serving\na multitude of purposes. In addition to employing a laissez-faire style of regulation\non international trade, they also were beginning to attract speculators seeking to\nparticipate in a market with unrivaled liquidity and continued growth. Ultimately,\nthe death of Bretton Woods in 1971 marked the beginning of a new economic era, one\nthat liberated international trading while also proliferating speculative opportunities.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS20■Plaza Accord—Devaluation\nof the U.S. Dollar (1985)\nAfter the demise of all the various exchange rate regulatory mechanisms that\ncharacterized the twentieth century—t hat is, the Gold Standard, the Bretton\nWoods Standard, and the Smithsonian Agreement—the currency market was left\nwith virtually no regulation other than the mythical ‘‘invisible hand’’ of free\nmarket capitalism, one that supposedly strived to create economic balance through\nsupply and demand. Unfortunately, due to a number of unforeseen economic\nevents—such as the OPEC oil crises, stagﬂation throughout the 1970s, and drastic\nchanges in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ﬁscal policy—supply and demand, in and\nof themselves, became insufﬁcient means by which the currency markets could be\nregulated. A system of sorts was needed, but not one that was inﬂexible: Fixation of\ncurrency values to a commodity, such as gold, proved to be too rigid for economic\ndevelopment, as was also the notion of ﬁxing maximum exchange rate ﬂuctuations.\nThe balance between structure and rigidity was one that had plagued the currency\nmarkets throughout the twentieth century, and while advancements had been made,\na deﬁnitive solution was still greatly needed.\nHence, in 1985, the respective ministers of ﬁnance and central bank governors\nof the world’s leading economies—France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom,\nand the United States—convened in New York City, with the hopes of arranging a\ndiplomatic agreement that would work to optimize the economic effectiveness of\nthe foreign exchange markets. Meeting at the Plaza Hotel, the international leaders\ncame to the following agreements regarding speciﬁc economies and the international\neconomy as a whole:\n■Across the world, inﬂation was at very low levels. Contrary to the stagﬂation of\nthe 1970s—where inﬂation was high and real economic growth was low—the\nglobal economy in 1985 had done a complete 180, as inﬂation was now low and\ngrowth was strong.\n■While low inﬂation, even when coupled with robust economic growth, still\nallowed for low interest rates—a caveat that developing countries particularly\nenjoyed—there was an imminent danger of protectionist policies such as tariffs\nentering the economy. The United States was experiencing a large and growing\ncurrent account deﬁcit, while Japan and Germany were facing large and growing\nsurpluses. An imbalance so fundamental in nature could create serious economic\ndisequilibrium, which, in turn, would result in a distortion of the foreign exchange\nmarkets, and thus, the international economy as a whole.\n■The results of current account imbalances, and the protectionist policies that\nensued, required action. Ultimately, it was believed that the rapid acceleration\nin the value of the U.S. dollar, which appreciated more than 80% against the\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS21currencies of its major trading partners, was the primary culprit. The rising\nvalue of the U.S. dollar created enormous trade deﬁcits, hurting many different\neconomies.\nAt the meeting in the Plaza Hotel, the Uni ted States persuad ed other attending\ncountries to coordinate a multilateral intervention, and on September 22, 1985,\nthe Plaza Accord was implemented. This agreement was designed to allow for\na controlled decline of the dollar and the appreciation of the main anti-dollar\ncurrencies. Each country agreed to changes to their economic policies and to\nintervene in currency markets as necessary to weaken the value of the dollar. The\nUnited States agreed to cut its budget deﬁcit and lower interest rates. France, the\nUnited Kingdom, Germany, and Japan agreed to raise interest rates. Germany also\nagreed to tax cuts, while Japan agreed to let the value of the yen ‘‘fully reﬂect\nthe underlying strength of the Japanese economy.’’ However, one major problem\nwas that not every country adhered to their pledges made under the Plaza Accord.\nThe United States, in particular, did not follow through with its initial promise to\ncut the budget deﬁcit. Japan was severely hurt by the sharp rise in the yen, as its\nexporters were unable to remain competitive overseas, and it is argued that this\neventually triggered a 10-year recession in Japan. The United S tates, on the other\nhand, enjoyed considerable growth and price stability as a result of the agreement.\nThe effects of the multilateral intervention were seen immediately, and within\nless than two years, the dollar fell 46% and 50% against the German deutschemark\nand the Japanese yen, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.1.

This gradually resolved\nthe current account deﬁcits for the time being, and also ensured that protectionist\npolicies were minimal and nonthreatening. But perhaps most importantly, the\nPlaza Accord cemented the role of the central banks in regulating exchange rate\nmovement—yes, the rates would not be ﬁxed, and hence would be determined\nprimarily by supply and demand; but ultimately, such an invisible hand is insufﬁcient,\nand it was the right and responsibility of the world’s central banks to intervene on\nbehalf of the international economy when necessary.\n■George Soros—The Man Who Broke the Bank\nof England\nWhen George Soros placed a $10 billion speculative bet on the UK pound and\nwon, he became universally known as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England.’’\nWhether you love him or hate him, Soros led the charge in one of the most\nfascinating events in currency trading history. Here are the details.\nThe UK Joins the Exchange Rate Mechanism\nIn 1979, a Franco-German initiative set up the European Monetary System (EMS) to\nstabilize exchange rates, reduce inﬂation, and prepare for monetary integration. The\nExchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), one of the EMS’s main components, gave each\nparticipatory currency a central exchange rate against a basket of currencies, the\nEuropean Currency Unit (ECU). Participants (initially France, Germany, Italy, the\nNetherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and Luxemburg) were then required to\nmaintain their exchange rates within a 2.25% ﬂuctuation band above or below each\nbilateral central rate. The ERM was an adjustable-peg system, and nine realignments\nwould occur between 1979 and 1987. Whil e the United Kingdom was not one of\nthe original members, it would eventually join in 1990 at a rate of DM2.95 to the\npound and with a ﬂuctuation band of +/–6%.\nUntil mid-1992, the ERM appeared to be a success, as a disciplinary effect\nhad reduced inﬂation throughout Europe under the leadership of the German\nBundesbank. The stability wouldn’t last, however, as international investors started\nworrying that the exchange rate values of several currencies within the ERM\nwere inappropriate. Following German reuniﬁcation in 1989 government spending\nsurged, forcing the Bundesbank to print more money. This led to high inﬂation\nand left the German central bank with little choice but to increase interest rates.\nHowever, the rate hike came with consequences as it placed upward pressure on\nthe German mark. This forced other central banks to raise their interest rates as\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS23well as to maintain their pegged currency exchange rates (a direct application of\nIrving Fischer’s interest parity theory). Realizing that the UK’s weak economy and\nhigh unemployment rate would not permit the British government to maintain this\npolicy for long, George Soros stepped into action.\nSoros Bets Against the Success of UK Involvement in the ERM\nThe quantum hedge fund manager essentially wanted to bet that the pound would\ndepreciate because the United Kingdom would either devalue the pound or leave the\nERM. Thanks to the progressive removal of capital controls during the EMS years,\ninternational investors at the time had more freedom than ever to take advantage\nof perceived disequilibria, so Soros established short positions in pounds and long\npositions in marks by borrowing pounds and investing in mark-denominated assets.\nHe also made great use of options and futures. In all, his positions accounted for\na gargantuan $10 billion. Soros was not the only one; many other investors soon\nfollowed suit. Everyone was selling pounds, placing tremendous downward pressure\non the currency.\nAt ﬁrst, the Bank of England (BoE) tried to defend the pegged rates by buying\n15 billion pounds with its large reserve assets, but its sterilized interventions\n(whereby the monetary base is held constant thanks to open market interventions)\nwere limited in their effectiveness. The pound was trading dangerously close to the\nlower levels of its ﬁxed band. On September 16, 1992, a day that would later be\nknown as Black Wednesday, the bank announced a 2% rise in interest rates (from\n10% to 12%) in an attempt to boost the pound’s appeal. A few hours later, it\npromised to raise rates again to 15%, but international investors such as Soros could\nnot be swayed, knowing that huge proﬁts were right around the corner. Traders\nkept selling pounds in huge volumes, and the BoE kept buying them until, ﬁnally, at\n7:00 pm that same day, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced that Britain would\nleave the ERM and that rates would return to their initial level of 10%. The chaotic\nBlack Wednesday marked the beginning of a steep depreciation in the pound’s\neffective value.\nWhether the return to a ﬂoating currency was due to the Soros-led attack on\nthe pound or because of simple fundamental analysis is still debated today. What\nis certain, however, is that the pound’s depreciation of almost 15% against the\ndeutschemark and 25% against the dollar over the next ﬁve weeks as seen in Figure 2.2\nand Figure 2.3 resulted in tremendous proﬁts for Soros and others traders (the pound\nalso weakened by a similar proportion to the dollar). Within a month, the quantum\nfund cashed in on approximately $2 billion by selling the now more expensive\nDMs and buying back the now cheaper pounds. ‘‘The man who broke the Bank of\nEngland’’ showed how central banks can still be vulnerable to speculative attacks.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS243.00British Pound vs. Deutschemark (GBPDEM)\n2.90\n2.80\n2.70\n2.60\n2.50\n2.40\n2.30\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.2 GBPDEM after Soros\n2.10\n2.00\n1 .90\n1 .80\n1 .70\n1 .60\n1 .50\n1 .40British Pound Against US Dollar GBPUSD\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.3 GBPUSD after Soros\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS25■Asian Financial Crisis (1997–1998)\nFalling like a set of dominos on July 2, 1997, the relatively nascent Asian tiger\neconomies provide the perfect example of the interdependence in global capital\nmarkets and their subsequent effects throughout international currency forums.\nBased on several fundamental breakdowns, the cause of the ‘‘contagion’’ stemmed\nlargely from shrouded lending practices, inﬂated trade deﬁcits, and immature capital\nmarkets. Compiled, these factors contributed to a perfect storm that left major\nregional markets incapacitated and once-prized currencies devalued to signiﬁcantly\nlower levels. With adverse effects easily seen in the equities markets, currency\nmarket ﬂuctuations were negatively impacted in much the same manner during this\ntime period.\nThe Bubble\nLeading up to 1997, investors had become increasingly attracted to Asian investment\nprospects, focusing on real estate development and domestic equities. As a result,\nforeign investment capital ﬂowed into the region as economic growth rates climbed\non improved production in countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and\nKorea. Thailand, home of the baht, experienced a 6.5% growth rate in 1996, falling\nfrom 13% in 1988. Lending additional support for a stronger economy was the\nenactment of a ﬁxed currency peg to the U.S. dollar. With a ﬁxed valuation to\nthe greenback, countries like Thailand could ensure ﬁnancial stability in their own\nmarkets and a constant rate for export trading purposes with the world’s largest\neconomy. Ultimately, the region’s national currencies appreciated, as underlying\nfundamentals were justiﬁed and increased speculative positions of further climbs in\nprice mounted.\nBallooning Current Account Deﬁcits and Nonperforming Loans\nHowever, in early 1997, a shift in sentiment began to occur as international account\ndeﬁcits became increasingly difﬁcult for respective governments to handle and\nlending practices were revealed to be detrimental to the economic infrastructure. In\nparticular, economists were alerted to the fact that Thailand’s current account deﬁcit\nballooned in 1996 to $14.7 billion and had been climbing since 1992. Although\ncomparatively smaller than the U.S. deﬁcit, the gap represented 8% of the country’s\ngross domestic product. Shrouded lending practices also contributed heavily to\nthese breakdowns, as close personal relationships with high-ranking banking ofﬁcials\nwere well rewarded and surprisingly common throughout the region. In particular\nthis affected many of South Korea’s highly leveraged conglomerates as total\nnonperforming loan values skyrocketed to 7.5 percent of gross domestic product.\nAdditional evidence of these practices could be observed in ﬁnancial institutions\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS26throughout Japan. First announcing questionable and nonperforming loans of\n$136 billion in 1994, Japanese authorities admitted to an alarming $400 billion\ntotal a year later. Coupled with a then-crippled stock market, cooling real estate\nvalues, and dramatic slowdowns in the economy, investors saw opportunity in\na depreciating yen, subsequently adding selling pressure to neighbor currencies.\nWhen their own asset bubble collapsed, asset prices fell by $10 trillion, with\nthe fall in real estate prices accounting for nearly 65% of the total decline—the\nlosses were worth two years of national output. This fall in asset prices sparked\nthe banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early 1990s and then developed into a\nfull-blown, systemic crisis in 1997, following the failure of a number of high-proﬁle\nﬁnancial institutions. In response, Japanese monetary authorities issued rhetoric on\npotentially increasing benchmark interest rates in hopes of defending the domestic\ncurrency valuation. Unfortunately, these considerations never materialized and a\nshortfall ensued. Sparked mainly by an announcement of a managed ﬂoat of the Thai\nbaht, the slide snowballed as central bank reserves evaporated and currency price\nlevels became unsustainable in light of downside selling pressure.\nCurrency Crisis\nFollowing mass short speculation and attempted intervention, the aforementioned\nAsian economies were left ruined and momentarily incapacitated. The Thailand baht,\na once-prized possession, was devalued by as much as 48 percent, even slumping\ncloser to a 100% fall at the turn of the new year. The most adversely affected was\n01/01/97 02/01/97 03/01/97 04/01/97 05/01/97 06/01/97 07/01/97 08/01/97 09/01/97 10/01/97 11/01/97 12/01/97 01/01/98 02/01/98 03/01/98 04/01/9860\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0140001997–98 Asian Currency Fluctuations\n12000\n10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0Thailand Baht Indonesia Rupiah\nFIGURE 2.4 Asian Crisis Price Action\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS27150USDJPY During Asian Crisis\n145\n140\n135\n130\n125\n120\n115\n110\n105\n100\n5/3/19966/3/19967/3/19968/3/19969/3/199610/3/199611/3/199612/3/19961/3/19972/3/19973/3/19974/3/19975/3/19976/3/19977/3/19978/3/19979/3/199710/3/199711/3/199712/3/19971/3/19982/3/19983/3/19984/3/19985/3/19986/3/1998\nFIGURE 2.5 USDJPY Asian Crisis Price Action\nthe Indonesian rupiah.

Among the majors, the Japanese yen fell approximately 23%\nfrom its high to low against the U.S. do llar between 1997 and 1998, and after having\nretraced a signiﬁcant portion of its losses, ended the 8-month debacle down 15%,\na ss h o w ni nF i g u r e2 . 5 .\nLasting for less than a year, the ﬁnancial crisis of 1997 revealed the interconnec-\ntivity of economies and their effects in the global currency markets. Additionally, it\nshowed the inability of central banks to successfully intervene in currency valuations\nwith the absence of secure economic fundamentals and overwhelming market forces.\nToday, with the assistance of IMF reparation packages and the implementation of\nstricter requirements, Asia’s four little dragons are healthy once again. With inﬂa-\ntionary benchmarks and a revived exporting market, Southeast Asia is building back\nits once prominent stature among the world’s industrialized economic regions. With\nthe experience of evaporating currency reserves under their belt, the Asian tigers\nnow take active initiatives to ensure that there is large pot of reserves on hand in\ncase speculators attempt to attack their currencies once again.\n■Introduction of the Euro (1999)\nThe introduction of the euro was a monumental achievement, marking the largest\nmonetary changeover ever. The euro was ofﬁcially launched as an electronic trading\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS28currency on January 1, 1999. Euro notes and coins were put into circulation in 2002.\nThe 11 initial member states were: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy,\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, and Finland. As of 2015, there\nare 17 countries in the Eurozone. Each country ﬁxed its currency to a speciﬁc\nconversion rate against the euro, and a common monetary policy governed by the\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) was adopted. To many economists, the system would\nideally include all of the original 15 EU nations, but the United Kingdom, Sweden,\nand Denmark decided to keep their own currencies. In deciding whether to adopt\nthe euro, EU members have many important factors to consider.\nThe 1993 Maastricht Treaty sets out ﬁve main convergence criteria for member\nstates to participate in the European Monetary Union (EMU):\nMaastricht Treaty: C onvergence Criteria\n■The country’s government budget deﬁcit could not be greater than 3% of GDP.\n■The country’s government debt could not be larger than 60% of GDP.\n■The country’s exchange rate had to be maintained within ERM bands without any\nrealignment for two years prior to joining.\n■The country’s inﬂation rate could not be higher than 1.5% above the average\ninﬂation rate of the three EU countries with the lowest inﬂation rates.\n■The country’s long-term interest rate on government bonds could not be higher\nthan 2% above the average of the comparable rates in the three countries with the\nlowest inﬂation.\nAlthough the ease of traveling is one of the most attractive reasons to join the\neuro, being part of the monetary union provides other beneﬁts:\n■It eliminates exchange rate ﬂuctuations, providing a more stable environment to\ntrade within the euro area.\n■The purging of all exchange rate risk within the zone allows businesses to plan\ninvestment decisions with greater certainty.\n■Transaction costs also diminish, mainly those relating to foreign exchange\noperations, hedging operations, cross-border payments, and the management of\nseveral currency accounts.\n■Prices become more transparent as consumers and businesses can compare prices\nacross countries more easily, which, in turn, increases competition.\n■A huge single currency market becomes more attractive for foreign investors.\n■The economy’s magnitude and stability allow the ECB to control inﬂation with\nlower interest rates, thanks to increased credibility.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS\nk\nk29\nk\nk\nFIGURE 2.6 EURUSD Price Since Launch\nSource: eSignal\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS30Yet the euro is not without its limitations. Leaving aside political sovereignty\nissues, the main problem is that, by adopting the euro, a nation essentially forfeits\nany independent monetary policy. Since each country’s economy is not perfectly\ncorrelated to the EMU’s economy, a nation might ﬁnd the ECB hiking interest\nrates during a domestic recession. This can be particularly true for many of the\nsmaller nations. As a result, countries try to rely more heavily on ﬁscal policy, but\nthe efﬁciency of ﬁscal policy is limited when it is not effectively combined with\nmonetary policy. This inefﬁciency is further exacerbated by the 3% of GDP limit on\nbudget deﬁcits, as stipulated by the Stability and Growth Pact.\nSome concerns also subsist regarding the ECB’s effectiveness as a central bank.\nThe central bank strives for a 2% inﬂation target, but in the past 15 years, it strayed\naway from this level often. Also, from 1999 to late 2002, a lack of conﬁdence\nin the union’s currency (and in the union itself) led to a 24% depreciation, from\napproximately $1.15 to the euro in January 1999 to $0.88 in May 2000, forcing\nthe ECB to intervene in foreign exchange markets in the last few months of 2000.\nFigure 2.6 shows a daily chart of the euro since it was launched in 1999.\nSince 2000, things have greatly changed, with the euro trading at a premium to\nthe dollar, but quantitative easing in 2014 put the currency back in a downtrend\nversus the dollar. Some analysts claim that the euro will one day replace the dollar\nas the world’s dominant international currency, and while we believe it will have a\ngreater share in reserve portfolios, we doubt that this will be likely.\n31CHAPTER 3\nWhat Moves the\nCurrency Market?\nNow that we know a little bit about the history of the forex market, let’s take a\nlook at what moves currencies. There are two primary ways to analyze ﬁnancial\nmarkets: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis is rooted\nin understanding underlying economic conditions, while technical analysis uses\nhistorical prices to predict future movements. For as long as technical analysis\nhas been around, there has been an ongoing debate as to which methodology\nis more successful. Short-term traders prefer to use technical analysis, focusing\ntheir strategies primarily on price action, while medium-term traders tend to use\nfundamental analysis to determine a currency’s current and future valuation.\nBefore implementing successful trading strategies, it is important to understand\nwhat drives the movements of currencies in the foreign exchange market. The\nbest strategies tend to be the ones that combine both fundamental and technical\nanalysis. Textbook perfect technical formations have failed too often because of\nmajor fundamental news and events like U.S. nonfarm payrolls. But trading on\nfundamentals alone can also be risky. There will oftentimes be sharp gyrations in\nthe price of currency on a day when there are no news or economic reports. This\nsuggests that the price action is driven by nothing more than ﬂows, sentiment, and\npattern formations. Therefore, it is very important for technical traders to be aware\nof the key economic data or events that are scheduled for release, and, in turn,\nfor fundamental traders to be aware of important technical levels that the general\nmarket may be focusing on.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?32■Fundamental Analysis\nFundamental analysis focuses on the economic, social, and political forces that drive\nsupply and demand. Those using fundamental analysis as a trading tool look at\nvarious macroeconomic indicators such as growth rates, interest rates, inﬂation,\nand unemployment. We outlined some of the most important economic releases\nin the ﬁrst chapter of this book. Fundamental analysts will combine all of this\ninformation to assess current and future performance. This requires a lot of work\nand thorough analysis, as there is no single set of beliefs that guides fundamental\nanalysis. Traders employing fundamental analysis need to continually keep abreast\nof news and announcements, as they can indicate potential changes to the economic,\nsocial, and political environment. All traders should be aware of the broad economic\nconditions before placing trades. This is especially important for day traders who\nare trying to make trading decisions based on news events because even though\nFederal Reserve Monetary Policy decisions are always important, if the rate move is\ncompletely priced into the market, then the actual reaction in the EURUSD could\nbe nominal.\nTaking a step back, currencies move primarily based on supply and demand.\nThat is, on the most fundamental level, a currency rallies because there is demand\nfor that currency. Regardless of whether the demand is for hedging, speculative,\nor conversion purposes, true movements are based on the need for the currency.\nCurrency values decrease when there is excess supply. Supply and demand should be\nthe real determinants for predicting future movements. However, how to predict\nsupply and demand is not as simple as many would think. There are many factors\nthat contribute to the net supply and demand for a currency. This includes capital\nﬂows, trade ﬂows, speculative, and hedging needs.\nFor example, the U.S. dollar was very strong (against the euro) between 1999\nand the end of 2001. This rally was driven primarily by the dot-com boom and the\ndesire by foreign investors to participate in these elevated returns. This demand\nfor U.S. assets required foreign investors to sell their local currencies and purchase\nU.S. dollars. Since the end of 2001, geopolitical uncertainty arose, the United States\nstarted cutting interest rates, and foreign investors started to sell U.S. assets in\nsearch of higher yields elsewhere. This required foreign investors to sell U.S. dollars,\nincreasing supply and lowering the dollar’s value against other major currency pairs.\nThe availability of funding or interest in buying a currency is a major factor that can\nimpact the direction that a currency trades. It was one of the primary drivers of the\nU.S. dollar between 2002 and 2005, making foreign ofﬁcial purchases of U.S. assets\n(also known as the Treasury International Capital Flow, or TIC data) an important\neconomic indicator.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?33Capital and Trade Flows\nCapital ﬂows and trade ﬂows constitute a country’s balance of payments, which\nquantiﬁes the amount of demand for a currency over a given period of time.\nTheoretically, a balance of payments equal to zero is required for a currency to\nmaintain its current valuation. A negative balance of payments number, on the other\nhand, indicates that capital is leaving the economy at a more rapid rate than it is\nentering, and hence, it should fall in value.\nThis is particularly important in current conditions (at the time of this book’s\npublication), where the United States is running a consistently large trade deﬁcit\nwithout sufﬁcient foreign inﬂow to fund that deﬁcit. As a result of this very problem,\nthe trade-weighted dollar index fell 22% in value between 2003 and 2005. The\nJapanese yen is another good example. As one of the world’s largest exporters, Japan\nruns a very high trade surplus. Therefore, despite a zero interest rate policy that\nprevents capital ﬂows from increasing, the yen has a natural tendency to trade lower\nbased on trade ﬂows, which is the other side of the equation. To be more speciﬁc,\nfollowing is a more detailed explanation of what capital and trade ﬂows encompass.\nCapital Flows\nCapital ﬂows measure the net amount of a currency that is being purchased or sold\ndue to capital investments. A positive capital ﬂow balance implies that foreign inﬂows\nof physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed outﬂows. A negative\ncapital ﬂow balance indicates that there are more physical or portfolio investments\nbought by domestic investors than foreign investors. There are generally two types\nof capital ﬂows—physical ﬂows and portfolio ﬂows (which are further segmented\ninto equity markets and ﬁxed-income markets).\nPhysical Flows\nPhysical ﬂows encompass actual foreign direct investments by corporations such as\ninvestments in real estate, manufacturing, and local acquisitions. All of these require\nthat a foreign corporation sell its local currency and buy the foreign currency, which\nleads to movements in the FX market. This is particularly important for global\nmergers and corporate acquisitions that involve more cash than stock.\nPhysical ﬂows are important to watch, as they represent the underlying changes\nin actual physical investment activity. These ﬂows shift in response to changes in\neach country’s ﬁnancial health and growth opportunities. Changes in local laws that\nencourage foreign investment also serve to promote physical ﬂows. For example,\ndue to China’s entry into the WTO, its foreign investment laws have been relaxed.\nAs a result of China’s cheap labor and attractive revenue opportunities (population\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?34of over 1 billion), corporations globally have ﬂooded China with investments. From\nan FX perspective, in order to fund investments in China, foreign corporations need\nto sell their local currency and buy Chinese renminbi (RMB).\nPortfolio Flows in Equity Markets\nAs technology has enabled greater ease with respect to transportation of capital,\ninvesting in global equity markets has become far more feasible. Accordingly, a\nrallying stock market in any part of the world serves as an ideal opportunity for all,\nregardless of geographic location. The result of this has become a strong correlation\nbetween a country’s equity markets and its currency: If the equity market is rising,\ninvestment dollars generally come in to seize the opportunity. Alternatively, falling\nequity markets could prompt domestic investors to sell their shares of local publicly\ntraded ﬁrms to take advantage of investment opportunities abroad.\nThe attraction of equity markets over ﬁxed-income markets has increased across\nthe years. Since the early 1990s, the ratio of foreign transactions in U.S. government\nbonds over U.S. equities has declined from 10 to 1 to 2 to 1. As indicated in\nFigure 3.1, it is evident that the Dow had a high correlation (of approximately 81%)\nwith the U.S. dollar (against the EUR) between 1994 and 1999. In addition, from\n1991–1999, the Dow increased 300%, while the USD index appreciated nearly 30%\nfor the same time period. As a result, currency traders closely followed the global\nequity markets to predict short and intermediate term equity-based capital ﬂows.\nHowever, this relationship shifted after the tech bubble burst in the United States as\n1/31/9412500 1. 15\n1. 10\n1 .05\n1 .00\n0.95\n0.90\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n0.70\n0.6511500\n10500\n9500\n8500\n7500\n6500\n5500\n4500\n3500\n6/30/94 11/30/94 4/28/95 9/29/95 2/29/96 7/31/96 12/31/96Dow Jones and USDEUR\n5/30/97 10/31/97 3/31/98 8/31/98 1/29/99 6/30/99 11/30/99INDU Index Px Last USDEUR Curncy\nFIGURE 3.1 Dow and USDEUR\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?35foreign investors remained relatively risk averse causing a lower correlation between\nthe performance of the U.S. equity market and the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, a\nrelationship still exists, making it important for all traders to keep an eye on global\nmarket performances in search of intermarket opportunities.\nPortfolio Flows in Fixed-Income Markets\nJust as the equity market is correlated to exchange rate movement, so too is the\nﬁxed-income market. In times of global uncertainty, ﬁxed-income investments can\nbecome particularly appealing, due to the inherent safety they possess. As a result,\neconomies boasting the most valuable ﬁxed-income opportunities will be capable of\nattracting foreign investment—which will naturally ﬁrst require the purchasing of\nthe country’s respective currency.\nA good gauge of ﬁxed-income capital ﬂows are the short- and long-term yields of\ninternational government bonds. It is important to monitor the spread differential\nbetween the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the yield on foreign bonds because\ninternational investors tend to move money from one country to another in search\nof the highest yielding assets. When U.S. assets have one of the highest yields,\nthis encourages more investments in U.S. ﬁnancial instruments, hence beneﬁting\nthe U.S. dollar. When the United States has the lowest yields, this discourages\ninvestments. Investors can also use short-term yields, such as the spreads on 2-year\ngovernment bonds, to gauge the short-term ﬂow of international funds. Aside from\ngovernment bond yields, Fed fund futures can also be used to estimate movement\nof U.S. funds, as they price in the expectation of future Fed interest rate policy.\nEuribor futures are a barometer for the Euro region’s expected future interest rates\nand can give an indication of EU future policy movements. We will discuss how to\nuse ﬁxed-income products to trade FX further in our strategy section.\nTrade Flows: Measuring Exports versus Imports\nTrade ﬂows are the basis of all international transactions. Just as the investment\nenvironment of a given economy is a key driver of its currency valuation, trade ﬂows\nrepresent a country’s net trade balance. Countries that are net exporters—meaning\nthey sell more goods abroad than they buy—will experience a net trade surplus.\nCountries that are net exporters are more likely to have their currency rise in value\nbecause from the perspective of international trade, their currency is being bought\nmore than it is sold. This impacts currency ﬂows because international clients buying\nthe exported product/service must ﬁrst buy the currency of the exporting nation.\nCountries who are net importers purchase more goods abroad than they sell,\ncreating a trade deﬁcit. These nations will generally see more downward than\nupward pressure on their currencies because in order to purchase these foreign\ngoods, importers must sell their own currency and purchase the currency of the\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?36country from which they are buying the good or service. This accordingly drives\ndown the value of the currency when all else is equal. This concept is important\nbecause it is one of primary reasons why many economists say that certain currencies\nneed to fall to reverse burgeoning trade deﬁcits.\nTo understand this further, let’s imagine that the UK economy is booming,\nand its stock market is performing well. Meanwhile, in the United States, a\nlackluster economy is creating a shortage of investment opportunities. In this type\nof environment U.S. investors will feel more inclined to sell their U.S. dollars and\nbuy British pounds to participate in the outperformance of the UK economy. When\nthey elect to do so, it results in the outﬂow of capital from the United States and\nthe inﬂow of capital into the United Kingdom. From an exchange rate perspective,\nthis would induce a fall in the USD coupled with a rise in the GBP, as demand for\nUSD declines and the demand for GBP increases, translating into strength for the\nGBP/USD currency pair.\nEven day and swing traders will ﬁnd it valuable to keep up with incoming\neconomic reports from the major economies.\nTrading Tip: Charting Economic Surprises\nOne way for traders to stay on top of economic trends is to chart economic data\nsurprises against price action. Figure 3.2 illustrates how this can be done. The chart\ngraphs how much an economic indicator has deviated from its consensus forecast,\nor the ‘‘surprise,’’ and stacks them on the same side and graphs price (blue line)\naction when the data was release against the surprise, with a simple regression line\n(white line). This can be done for all of the major currency pairs and provides a\nvisual guide to understanding whether price action has been in line with economic\nfundamentals and can be used as a guide to future price action. Economic data can\nbe found on the calendars of any major forex website, and price action can generally\nbe downloaded from your trading platforms.\nAccording to Figure 3.2, in November of 2004, there were 14 out of 15 positive\neconomic surprises and yet the dollar sold off against the euro during the month\nof December, which was the month in which the economic data were released.\nAlthough this methodology is not exact, the analysis is simple and past charts\nhave yielded some extremely useful clues to future price action. Figure 3.3 shows\nhow the EURUSD moved the following month. As you can see, the EURUSD\nquickly corrected itself during the month of January, indicating that the fundamental\ndivergence from price action that occurred in December proved to be quite useful\nto dollar longs, which harvested almost 600 pips as the euro quickly retracted a large\npart of its gains in January. This method of analysis, called variant perception, was ﬁrst\ninvented by the legendary hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, who produced\n24% average rates return for 30 consecutive years.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?37US Dollar Data and EURUSD\n1 .3700\n1 .3600\n1 .3500\n1 .3400\n1 .3300\n1 .3200\n1. 3 10 0\n1 .3000\n–100%–26.11%0.00%0.00%1.41%1.46%2.56%2.81%3.55%4.18%14.29%16.67%33.33%43.48%50.25%140.00%\n–50% 0% 50%Durable Goods\nEmpire State Manufacturing\nPhilly Fed\nLeading Economic Indicators\nPersonal Income\nIndustrial Production\nISM Non-Manufacturing\nCurrent Account\nExisting Home Sales\nGDP Annualized\nU.

Large positive and negative\nsurprises in economic data can often yield clues to future price action. If you go back\nand look at the EURUSD charts, you will see that the record current account deﬁcits\nin October 2004 were the catalyst that sent the dollar plunging over the next two\nmonths. In many ways, economic fundamentals matter more in the foreign exchange\nmarket than in any other market, and charts such as these could provide valuable\nclues to price direction. Generally, the 15 most important economic indices are\nchosen from each region, and then a price regression line is superimposed over the\npast 20 days of price data.\n■Technical Analysis\nPrior to the mid-1980s, fundamental traders dominated the FX market. However,\nwith the rising popularity of technical analysis and the advent of new technologies,\nthe inﬂuence of technical trading on the FX market has increased signiﬁcantly. The\navailability of high leverage also led to an increased number of high frequency and\nmomentum. They have become active participants in the FX market, with the acute\nability to inﬂuence currency prices.\nUnlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses on the study of price\nmovements. Technical analysts use historical currency data to forecast the direction\nof future prices. The underlying belief behind technical analysis is that all current\nmarket information is already reﬂected in the price of that currency; therefore,\nstudying price action is all that is required to make informed trading decisions. In a\nnutshell, technical analysis assumes that history will repeat itself.\nTechnical analysis is an extremely popular tool used by short- and medium-term\ntraders for analyzing the forex market. It works especially well in the currency\nmarkets because short-term currency price ﬂuctuations are primarily driven by\nhuman emotions or market perceptions. The primary tool in technical analysis\nis price and charts. Traders will look for trends and patterns to identify trading\nopportunities. The most basic concept of technical analysis is that markets have a\ntendency to trend. Being able to identify trends in their earliest stage of development\nis the key to technical analysis. Range trading is also very popular, and similar tools\ncan be used to identify these setups. Technical analysis integrates price action and\nmomentum to construct a pictorial representation of past currency price action and\nto use this information to predict future performance. Technical analysis tools such\nas Fibonacci retracement levels, moving averages, oscillators, candlestick charts, and\nBollinger bands provide further information on the value of the emotional extremes\nof buyers and sellers. It also helps to gauge when greed and fear are the strongest.\nThere are basically two types of markets, trending or range bound, and in the trade\nparameters section, we outline some rules that can help traders determine the type\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?39of market they trading in right now and the sort of trading opportunities they should\nbe looking for.\nIs Technical Analysis or Fundamental Analysis Better?\nNo one will ever win the age-long battle between technical and fundamental analysis.\nHowever, most individual traders will start trading with technical analysis because\nit is easier to understand and does not require hours of study. Technical analysts can\nalso follow many currencies and markets at one time, whereas fundamental analysts\ntend to focus on a few pairs due to the overwhelming amount of data in the market.\nNonetheless, technical analysis works well because the currency market tends to\ndevelop strong trends. Once technical analysis is mastered, it can be applied with\nequal ease to any time frame or currency traded.\nHowever, it is important to take both strategies into consideration, as fundamental\nanalysis can trigger technical movements such as breakouts or reversal in trends.\nTechnical analysis, on the other hand, can also explain moves that fundamentals\ncannot, especially in quiet markets, causing resistance in trends or unexplainable\nmovements. For example, as shown in Figure 3.4, in the days leading up to\nSeptember 11, USDJPY had just broken out of a triangle formation and looked\npoised to head higher. However, as the chart indicates, instead of breaking higher as\ntechnicians may have anticipated, USDJPY broke down following the September 11,\n2001, terrorist attacks and ended up hitting a low of 115.81 from a high of 121.88\non September 10.\n■Currency Forecasting—What Bookworms\nand Economists Look At\nFor more avid students of foreign exchange who want to learn more about\nfundamental analysis and valuing currencies, this section examines the different\nmodels of currency forecasting used by analysts of the major investment banks.\nThere are seven major models for forecasting currencies, which include the balance\nof payments theory, purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, the monetary\nmodel, the real interest rate differential model, the asset market model, and the\ncurrency substitution model.\nBalance of Payments Theory\nThe balance of payments theory states that exchange rates should be at their\nequilibrium level, which is the rate that produces a stable current account balance.\nCountries with trade deﬁcits experience a run on their foreign exchange reserves\ndue to the fact that exporters to that nation must sell that nation’s currency in order\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?k\nk40k\nk\nFIGURE 3.4 USDJPY September 11th Chart\nSource: eSignal\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?41to receive payment. The cheaper currency makes the nation’s exports less expensive\nabroad, which in turn fuels exports and brings the currency into balance.\nWhat Is the Balance of Payments (BOP)?\nThe balance of payments account is divided into two parts: the current account and\nthe capital account. The current account measures trade in tangible, visible items\nsuch as cars and manufactured goods; the trade balance is the surplus or deﬁcit\nbetween exports and imports. The capital account measures ﬂows of money, such\nas investments for stocks or bonds. Balance of payments data can be found on the\nwebsite of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nTrade Flows\nThe trade balance of a country shows the net difference over a period of time\nbetween a nation’s exports and imports. When a country imports more than it\nexports, the trade balance is negative or is in a deﬁcit. If the country exports more\nthan it imports, the trade balance is positive or is in a surplus. The trade balance\nreﬂects the redistribution of wealth among countries and is a major channel through\nwhich the macroeconomic policies of a country may affect another.\nIn general, if a country has a trade deﬁcit, it is considered to be unfavorable, since\nit negatively impacts the value of the nation’s currency. For example, if U.S. trade\nﬁgures show greater imports than exports, more dollars ﬂow out of the United\nStates and the value of the U.S. currency depreciates. A positive trade balance,\nin comparison, will affect the dollar by causing it to appreciate against the other\ncurrencies.\nCapital Flows\nIn addition to trade ﬂows, there are also capital ﬂows that occur among countries.\nThey record a nation’s incoming and outgoing investment ﬂows, such as payments\nfor entire or parts of companies, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, real estate, and\nfactories. Capital ﬂows are inﬂuenced by many factors, including the ﬁnancial and\neconomic climate of other countries, and can be in the form of physical or portfolio\ninvestments. In general, in developing countries, the composition of capital ﬂows\ntends to be skewed toward foreign direct investment (FDI) and bank loans. For\ndeveloped countries, due to the strength of the equity and ﬁxed-income markets,\nstocks and bonds appear to be more important than bank loans and FDI.\nEquity Markets\nEquity markets have a signiﬁcant impact on exchange rate movements because\nthey are a major place for high-volume currency movements. Their importance is\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?42considerable for the currencies of countries with developed capital markets, where\na great amount of capital inﬂows and outﬂows occur, and where foreign investors\nare major participants. The amount of the foreign investment ﬂows in the equity\nmarkets is dependent on the general health and growth of the market, reﬂecting\nthe well-being of companies and particular sectors. Movements of currencies occur\nwhen foreign investors move their money to a particular equity market. Thus,\nthey convert their capital in a domestic currency and push the demand for it\nhigher, making the currency appreciate. When the equity markets are experiencing\nrecessions, however, foreign investors tend to ﬂee, thus converting back to their\nhome currency and pushing the domestic currency down.\nFixed-Income (Bond) Markets\nThe effect that ﬁxed-income markets have on currencies is similar to that of the\nequity markets and is a result of capital movements. An investor’s interest in the\nﬁxed-income market depends on the company’s speciﬁcs and credit rating, as well as\non the general health of the economy and the country’s interest rates. The movement\nof foreign capital into and out of ﬁxed-income markets leads to change in the demand\nand supply for currencies, hence impacting the currencies’ exchange rates.\nSummary of Trade and Capital Flows\nDetermining and understanding a country’s balance of payments is perhaps the\nmost important and useful tool for those interested in fundamental analysis. Any\ninternational transaction gives rise to two offsetting entries: trade ﬂow balance\n(current account) and capital ﬂow balance (capital account). If the trade ﬂow balance\nis a negative outﬂow, the country is buying more from foreigners than it sells\n(imports exceed exports). When it is a positive inﬂow, the country is selling more\nthan it buys (exports exceed imports). The capital ﬂow balance is positive when\nforeign inﬂows of physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed that\ncountry’s outﬂows. A capital ﬂow is negative when a country buys more physical or\nportfolio investments than are sold to foreign investors.\nThese two entries, trade and capital ﬂow, when added together signify a country’s\nbalance of payments. In theory, the two entries should balance and add up to zero\nin order to provide for the maintenance of the status quo in a nation’s economy and\ncurrency rates.\nIn general, countries might experience positive or negative trade, as well as\npositive or negative capital ﬂow balances. In order to minimize the net effect of\nthe two on the exchange rates, a country should try to maintain a balance between\nthe two. For example, in the United States, there is a substantial trade deﬁcit, as\nmore is imported than is exported. When the trade balance is negative, the country\nis buying more from foreigners than it sells, and therefore it needs to ﬁnance its\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?43deﬁcit. This negative trade ﬂow might be offset by a positive capital ﬂow into the\ncountry, as foreigners buy either physical or portfolio investments. Therefore, the\nUnited States seeks to minimize its trade deﬁcit and maximize its capital inﬂows,\nwith hopes that the two will balance out.\nA change in this balance is extremely signiﬁcant and carries ramiﬁcations that\nrun deep into economic policy and currency exchange levels. The net result of the\ndifference between the trade and capital ﬂows, positive or negative, will impact the\ndirection in which the nation’s currency will move. If the overall trade and capital\nbalance is negative, it will result in a depreciation of the nation’s currency, and if\npositive, it will lead to an appreciation of the currency.\nClearly, a change in the balance of payments carries a direct effect for currency\nlevels. It is therefore possible for any investor to observe economic data relating to\nthis balance and interpret the results that will occur. Data relating to capital and\ntrade ﬂows should be followed most closely. For instance, if an analyst observes\nan increase in the U.S. trade deﬁcit and a decrease in the capital ﬂows, a balance\nof payments deﬁcit would occur, and as a result, an investor may anticipate a\ndepreciation of the dollar.\nLimitations of BOP Model\nThe BOP model mainly focuses on traded goods and services, while ignoring\ninternational capital ﬂows. Indeed, international capital ﬂows often dwarfed trade\nﬂows in the currency markets toward the end of the 1990s, and this oftentimes\nbalanced out the current account of debtor nations like the United States.\nFor example, in 1999, 2000, and 2001, the United States maintained a large\ncurrent account deﬁcit while the Japanese ran a large current account surplus.\nHowever, during this same period in time the U.S. dollar rose against the yen even\nthough trade ﬂows were running against the dollar. The reason was that capital ﬂows\nbalanced out trade ﬂows, thus defying the BOP’s forecasting model for a period of\ntime. Indeed, the increase in capital ﬂows has given rise to the asset market model .\nNote: It is probably a misnomer to call this theory the balance of payments theory\nsince it only takes into account the current account balance, not the actual balance\nof payments. However, until the 1990s capital ﬂows played a very small role in the\nworld economy, so the main statistic viewed was the trade balance, which made up\nthe bulk of the balance of payments for most nations.\nPurchasing Power Parity\nThepurchasing power parity (PPP) theory is based on the belief that foreign exchange\nrates should be determined by the relative prices of a similar basket of goods between\ntwo countries. Any change in a nation’s inﬂation rate should be balanced by an\nopposite change in that nation’s exchange rate. Therefore, according to this theory,\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?44when a country’s prices are rising due to inﬂation, that country’s exchange rate\nshould depreciate in order to return to parity.\nPPP’s Basket of Goods\nThe basket of goods and services priced for the PPP exercise is a sample of all goods\nand services covered by GDP. It includes consumer goods and services, government\nservices, equipment goods, and construction projects. More speciﬁcally, consumer\nitems include food, beverages, tobacco, clothing, footwear, rents, water supply,\ngas, electricity, medical goods and services, furniture and furnishings, household\nappliances, personal transport equipment, fuel, transport services, recreational\nequipment, recreational and cultural services, telephone services, education services,\ngoods and services for personal care and household operation, and repair and\nmaintenance services.\nBig Mac Index\nOne of the most well-known examples of PPP is The Economist ’s Big Mac Index. The\nBig Mac PPP calculates the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the\nsame in America as elsewhere. Comparing these with actual rates helps to signal if\na currency is under- or overvalued. As described by The Economist, the index is a\nlightheartedly guide to currency valuation. It was never intended as a precise gauge\nof currency misalignment, but merely a tool to make exchange-rate theory more\ndigestible.\nFor example, in January 2015, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and\nChinese yuan was approximately 6.20. At the time, a Big Mac cost $4.79 in the\nUnited States. In China, the same burger cost 17.15 yuan, or approximately $2.77\nat market exchange. This means that based on the comparison between the two\nburger prices, the Chinese yuan was undervalued by 42%.\nOECD Purchasing Power Parity Index\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) releases a\nmore formal index. Under a joint OECD-Eurostat PPP Program, the OECD and\nEurostat share the responsibility for calculating PPPs. Their latest information on\nwhich currencies are under- or overvalued against the U.S. dollar can be found\non the OECD website at www.oecd.org. The OECD publishes a table that shows\nthe price levels for the major industrialized countries. Each column shows the\nnumber of speciﬁed monetary units needed in each of the countries listed to buy\nthe same representative basket of consumer goods and services. In each case,\nthe representative basket costs a hundred units in the country whose currency is\nspeciﬁed. The chart that is then created compares the PPP of a currency with its\nactual exchange rate. The chart is updated weekly to reﬂect the current exchange\nrate. It is also updated about twice a year to reﬂect new estimates of PPP. The\nPPP estimates are taken from studies carried out by the OECD; however, it should\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?45not be taken as deﬁnitive. Different methods of calculation will arrive at different\nPPP rates.\nAccording to the OECD’s data as of April 17, 2015, the PPP value of the\nAustralian dollar versus the U.S. dollar based on GDP is 0.6712. At the time, the\nAUD/USD exchange rate was 0.7812. Using this model of valuation, this indicates\nthat the Australian dollar was 14% overvalued.\nLimitations to Using Purchasing Power Parity\nPPP theory should only be used for long-term fundamental analysis. While the\neconomic forces behind PPP will eventually equalize the purchasing power of\ncurrencies, this can take many years. A time horizon of 5–10 years is typical.\nPPP’s major weakness is that it assumes goods can be traded easily, without regard\nto such things as tariffs, quotas, or taxes. For example, when the U.S. government\nannounces new tariffs on imported steel, the cost of domestic manufactured goods\ngoes up; but those increases will not be reﬂected in the U.S. PPP tables.\nThere are other factors that must also be considered when weighing PPP: inﬂation,\ninterest rate differentials, economic releases/reports, asset markets, trade ﬂows,\nand political developments. Indeed, PPP is just one of several theories traders should\nuse when determining exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Parity\nThe interest rate parity theory states that if two different currencies have different\ninterest rates, then that difference should be reﬂected in the premium or discount\nfor the forward exchange rate to prevent riskless arbitrage.\nFor example, if U.S. interest rates are 3% and Japanese interest rates are 1%,\nthen the U.S. dollar should depreciate against the Japanese yen by 2% in order\nto prevent riskless arbitrage. This future exchange rate is reﬂected in the forward\nexchange rate stated today. In our example, the forward exchange rate of the dollar\nis said to be at discount because it buys fewer Japanese yen in the forward rate than\nit does in the spot rate. The yen is said to be at a premium.\nInterest rate parity has shown very little proof of effectiveness in recent years.\nOftentimes, currencies with higher interest rates rise and attract incoming invest-\nment, while currencies with low and falling interest rates decline as outﬂows slow.\nThe Monetary Model\nAccording to the monetary model, exchange rates are determined by a nation’s\nmonetary policy. The premise is that countries that follow a stable monetary policy\nover time should have appreciating currencies. Countries that have erratic monetary\npolicies or excessively expansionist policies should see the value of their currency\ndepreciate.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?46How to Use the Monetary Model\nThree factors inﬂuence exchange rates under this theory:\n1. A nation’s money supply\n2. Expected future levels of a nation’s money supply\n3. The growth rate of a nation’s money supply\nAll of these factors are key to understanding and spotting a monetary trend that\nmay force a change in exchange rates. For example, let’s assume that the Japanese\neconomy has been slipping in and out of recession for over a decade. Interest rates\nare near zero and annual budget deﬁcits prevent the Japanese from spending their\nway out of recession, which leaves only one tool left at the disposal of Japanese\nofﬁcials determined to revive Japan’s economy: printing more money. By buying\nstocks and bonds, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is increasing the nation’s money supply,\nwhich produces inﬂation, and this forces a change in the exchange rate. The example\nin Figure 3.5 illustrates the effect of money supply changes to the Japanese yen using\nthe monetary model.\nIndeed, it is in the area of excessive expansionary monetary policy that the\nmonetary model is most successful. One of the only ways a country can keep\nits currency from sharply devaluing is by pursuing a tight monetary policy. For\nexample, during the Asian Currency Crisis, the Hong Kong dollar came under\nattack from speculators. Hong Kong ofﬁcials raised interest rates to 300% to halt\nthe Hong Kong dollar from being dislodged from its peg to the U.S. dollar. The\ntactic worked perfectly, as speculators were cleared out by such sky-high interest\nrates. The downside was that the Hong Kong economy would slide into recession.\nBut in the end, the peg held and the monetary model worked.\nLimitations of the Monetary Model\nVery few economists rely solely on this model because it does not take into account\ntrade ﬂows and capital ﬂows. For example, throughout 2014 Australia had higher\ninterest rates, growth rates, and inﬂation rates than both the United States and the\nEuropean Union, yet, the AUD appreciated in value against both the dollar and the\neuro. Indeed, the monetary model has greatly struggled since the dawn of freely\nCHANGE IN MONEY\nSUPPL Y\nY en Is Printed Increase in Y en Creates\nInflationY en Depreciates in ValueCHANGE IN EXCHANGE\nRATECHANGE IN PRICE\nLEVEL\nFIGURE 3.5 Monetary Model\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?47ﬂoating currencies. The model holds that high interest rates signal growing inﬂation,\nwhich it often does, followed by a depreciating currency. But this does not take into\naccount the capital inﬂows that would take effect as a result of higher interest yields\nor of an equity market that may be thriving in a booming economy—thus causing\nthe currency to possibly appreciate.\nIn any case, the monetary model is one of several valuation tools that can be\nemployed in tandem with other models to determine the direction an exchange rate\nis heading.\nReal Interest Rate Differential Model\nAccording to the real interest rate differential theory, exchange rate movements are\ndetermined by a country’s interest rate. The idea is that countries with high interest\nrates should see their currency appreciate in value, while countries with low interest\nrates should see their currency depreciate in value.\nBasics of the Model\nThe basic premise of the model is that when a country raises its interest rates,\ninternational investors will buy that currency because they ﬁnd its yield more\nattractive. When a country lowers interest rates, they sell the currency. Figure 3.6\nUK\nUKInterest Rates vs. United States Eurozone\nEurozone2003 Percent.

The Australian dollar had the\nlargest basis point spread and also had the highest return against the U.S. dollar,\nwhich seems to vindicate the model, as investors bought up higher-yielding Aussie.\nThe same can be said for the New Zealand dollar, which also had a higher yield\nthan the U.S. dollar and gained 27% against USD. Yet the model becomes less\nconvincing when comparing the euro, which gained 20% against the dollar (more\nthan every currency except NZD), even though its basis point differential was\nonly 100 points. The model then comes under serious question when comparing\nthe British pound and the Japanese yen. The yen differential is –100, and yet it\nappreciated almost 12% against the dollar. Meanwhile, the British pound gained\nonly 11% against the dollar even though it had a whopping 275 point interest rate\ndifferential.\nThis model also stresses that one of the key factors in determining the severity of\nan exchange rate’s response to a shift in interest rates is the expected persistence of\nthat shift. Simply put, a rise in interest rates that is expected to last for ﬁve years\nwill have a much larger impact on the exchange rate than if that rise were expected\nto last for only one year.\nLimitations to the Interest Rate Model\nThere is a great deal of debate among international economists over whether there\nis a strong and statistically signiﬁcant link between changes in a nation’s interest rate\nand currency price. The main weakness of this model is that it does not take into\naccount a nation’s current account balance, relying on capital ﬂows instead. Indeed,\nthe model tends to overemphasize capital ﬂows at the expense of numerous other\nfactors, such as political stability, inﬂation, and poor economic growth. Absent these\ntypes of factors, the model can be very useful, since it is quite logical to conclude\nthat an investor will naturally gravitate toward the investment vehicle that pays a\nhigher reward.\nThe Asset Market Model\nThe basic premise of the asset market model theory is that the ﬂow of funds into the\nﬁnancial assets of a country such as equities and bonds increases the demand for that\ncountry’s currency (and vice versa). As proof, advocates point out that the amount\nof funds that are placed in investment products such as stocks and bonds now dwarf\nthe amount of funds that is exchanged as a result of the transactions in goods and\nservices for import and export purposes. The asset market theory is basically the\nopposite of the balance of payments theory since it takes into account a nation’s\ncapital account instead of its current account.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?49A Dollar-Driven Theory\nThroughout 1999, many experts argued that the dollar would fall against the euro\non the grounds of the expanding U.S. current account deﬁcit and an overvalued\nWall Street. That was based on the rationale that non-U.S. investors would begin\nwithdrawing their funds from U.S. stocks and bonds into more economically sound\nmarkets, which would weigh signiﬁcantly on the dollar. Yet, such fears have lingered\nsince the early 1980s when the U.S. current account soared to a record high 3.5%\nof GDP.\nIn the two decades that followed, the balance of payments approach in assessing\nthe dollar’s behavior has given way to the asset market approach. This theory\ncontinues to hold the most sway over pundits due to the enormity of U.S. capital\nmarkets. In May and June of 2002, the dollar plummeted over 1000 points versus\nthe yen at the same time equity investors ﬂed U.S. equity markets due to the\naccounting scandals that were plaguing Wall Street. As the scandals subsided toward\nthe end of 2002, the dollar rose 500 points from a low of 115.43 to close at 120.00\nagainst the yen, even though the current account balance remained in massive deﬁcit\nthe entire time.\nLimitations to the Asset Market Theory\nIt is frequently argued that over the long run, there is no relationship between\na nation’s equity market performance and the performance of its currency. See\nFigure 3.7 for a comparison.

Only time\nwill tell whether the asset market model will hold up or merely be a short-term blip\non the currency forecasting radar.\nThe Currency Substitution Model\nThe currency substitution model is an enhanced version of the monetary model\nbecause it takes into account investor ﬂows. It posits that the shifting of private\nand public portfolios from one nation to another can have a signiﬁcant effect on\nexchange rates. The ability of individuals to change their assets from domestic and\nforeign currencies is known as currency substitution. When this model is added\nto the monetary model, evidence shows that shifts in expectations of a nation’s\nmoney supply can have a decided impact on that nation’s exchange rates. Simply\nput, investors are looking at monetary model data and coming to the conclusion\nthat a change in money ﬂow is about to occur, thus affecting the exchange rate, so\nthey are investing accordingly, which turns the monetary model into a self-fulﬁlling\nprophecy. Investors who subscribe to this theory are merely jumping on the currency\nsubstitution model bandwagon on the way to the monetary model party.\nThe Yen Example\nIn the monetary model we talked about how the Japanese government was basically\nprinting yen and increasing the money supply when it bought stocks and bonds.\nMonetary model theorists would say that this monetary growth would spark inﬂation\n(more yen chasing fewer products), decrease demand for the yen, and ﬁnally cause\nthe yen to depreciate. A currency substitution theorist would agree with this scenario\nand look to take advantage of this view by shorting the yen, or if they were long\nthe yen promptly getting out of the position. By taking this action, our yen trader\nis helping to drive the market precisely in that direction, thus making the monetary\nmodel theory a fate accompli. The step-by-step process is illustrated in Figure 3.8.\nA. Japan announces new stock and bond buyback plan. Economists are now\npredicting Japan’s money supply will dramatically increase.\nB. Economists are also predicting a rise in inﬂation with the introduction of this\nnew policy. Speculators expect a change in the exchange rate as a result.\nC. Economists expect interest rates to rise and inﬂation takes hold in the economy.\nSpeculators start selling short the yen in anticipation of a change in the exchange\nrate.\nD. Demand for the yen plummets as money ﬂows easily through the Japanese\neconomy and speculators dump yen in the markets.\nE. The exchange rate for the Japanese yen changes dramatically as the yen falls\nin value to foreign currencies, especially those that are easily substituted by\ninvestors (read: liquid yen crosses).\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?51Forecast of\nFuture\nMonetary\nGrowth Forecast of\nFuture InflationChange in\nExchange RateChange in Real\nMoney Demand\nChange in\nExpected\nExchange RateChange in\nDemand for\nForeign Cash\nAB CD EForecast of\nFuture Inflation\nFIGURE 3.8 Currency Substitution Model\nLimitations of the Currency Substitution Model\nAmong the major, actively traded currencies, this model has not yet shown itself\nto be a convincing, single determinant for exchange rate movements. While this\ntheory can be used with more conﬁdence in underdeveloped countries where ‘‘hot\nmoney’’ rushes in and out of emerging markets with enormous effect, there are\nstill too many variables not accounted for by the currency substitution model. For\nexample, using the yen illustration in Figure 3.8, even though Japan may try to spark\ninﬂation with its securities’ buyback plan, it still has an enormous current account\nsurplus that will continually prop up the yen. Also, Japan has numerous political\nlandmines it must avoid in its own neighborhood, and should Japan make it clear\nthat it is trying to devalue its currency, there will be enormous repercussions. These\nare just two of many factors the substitution model does not take into consideration.\nHowever, this model (like numerous other currency models) should be considered\npart of an overall, balanced, FX forecasting diet.",

Traditionally, it is the platform through which governments, businesses,\ninvestors, travelers, and other interested parties convert or ‘‘exchange’’ currency.\nAt its most fundamental level, the foreign exchange market is an over-the-counter\n(OTC) market with no central exchange and clearing house where orders are\nmatched. FX dealers and market makers around the world are linked to each other\naround-the-clock via telephone, computer, and fax, creating one cohesive market.\nThrough the years, this has changed with many institutions offering exchange traded\nFX instruments, but all of the prices are still derived from the underlying or spot\nforex market.\nIn the past two decades, foreign exchange, also known as forex orFX,became\navailable to trade by individual retail investors, and this access caused the market\nto explode in popularity. In the early 2000s, the Bank of International Settlements\nreported a 57% increase in volume between Ap ril 2001 and 2004. At the time more\nthan $1.9 trillion were changing hands on a daily basis. After the ﬁnancial crisis in\n2008, the pace of growth eased to a still- respectable 32% between 2010 and 2013,\nbut the actual volume that changed hands was signiﬁcantly larger at an average of\n$5.3 trillion per day. To put this into perspective, it is 50 times greater than the\ndaily trading volume of the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ combined.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET2While the growth of the retail foreign exchange market contributed to this surge\nin volume, an increase in volatility over the past few years also made investors\nmore aware of how currency movements can impact the equity and bond markets.\nIf stocks, bonds, and commodity traders want to make more educated trading\ndecisions, it is important for them to also follow forex movements. What follows\nare some of the examples of how currency ﬂuctuations impacted stock and bond\nmarket movements in past years.\n■EURUSD and Corporate Proﬁtability\nFor stock market traders, particularly those who invest in European corporations that\nexport a tremendous amount of goods to the United States, monitoring exchange\nrates are essential to predicting earnings and corporate proﬁtability. Throughout 2003\nand 2004, European manufacturers complained extensively about the rapid rise in the\neuro and the weakness in the U.S. dollar. The main culprit for the dollar’s selloff at\nthe time was the country’s rapidly growing trade and budget deﬁcits. This caused the\nEURUSD exchange rate to surge, which took a signiﬁcant toll on the proﬁtability of\nEuropean corporations because a higher exchange rate makes the goods of European\nexporters more expensive to U.S. consumers. In 2003, inadequate hedging shaved\napproximately EUR$1 billion euros from Volkswagen’s proﬁts, while DSM, a Dutch\nchemicals group, warned that a 1% move in the EURUSD rate would reduce proﬁts\nby EUR$7 million to EUR$11 million. Unfortunately, inadequate hedging is still a\nreality in Europe, which makes monitoring the EURUSD exchange rate even more\nimportant in forecasting the earnings and proﬁtability of European exporters.\n■Nikkei and U.S. Dollar\nTraders exposed to Japanese equities also need to be aware of the developments\nthat are occurring in the U.S. dollar and ho w that affects the Nikkei rally. Japan\nrecently came out of 10 years of stagnation. During this time, mutual funds and\nhedge funds were grossly underweight Japanese equities. When the economy began\nto turn around, global macro funds rushed to make changes to their portfolios in fear\nof missing out on a great opportunity to take advantage of Japan’s recovery. Hedge\nfunds borrowed signiﬁcant amount of dollars to pay for increased exposure, but the\nproblem was that their borrowings were very sensitive to U.S. interest rates and the\nFed’s monetary policy tightening cycle. Increased borrowing costs forthe dollar could\nderail the Nikkei’s rally because higher rates will raise the dollar’s ﬁnancing costs. Yet\nwith the huge current account deﬁcit, the Fed might need to continue raising rates\nto increase the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Therefore, continual\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET3rate hikes, coupled with slowing growth in Japan, may make it less proﬁtable for\nfunds to be overleveraged and overly exposed to Japanese stocks. As a result, how\nthe U.S. dollar moves also plays a role on the future direction of the Nikkei.\n■George Soros\nKnown as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England,’’ George Soros is one of\nthe most well-known traders in the FX market. We discuss his adventures in\nmore detail in Chapter 2, but in a nutshell, in 1990, England decided to join\nthe Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) system because it wanted to take part in\nthe stable and low-inﬂation environment created by the Bundesbank, the central\nbank of Germany. This alliance tied the pound to the deutschmark, which meant\nthat the United Kingdom was subject to the monetary policies enforced by the\nBundesbank. In the early 1990s, Germany aggressively increased interest rates to\navoid the inﬂationary effects related to German reuniﬁcation. However, national\npride and the commitment of ﬁxing exchange rates within the ERM prevented\nEngland from devaluing the pound. On Wednesday, September 16, also known as\nBlack Wednesday, George Soros leveraged the entire value of his fund ($1 billion) and\nsold $10 billion worth of pounds to bet against the ERM. This essentially ‘‘broke’’\nthe Bank of England and forced it to devalue the pound. In a matter of 24 hours, the\nBritish pound fell approximately 5%, or 5000 pips. The Bank of England promised\nto raise rates in order to tempt speculators to buy pounds. As a result, this caused\ntremendous volatility in the bond markets, with 1-month UK LIBOR rates rising\n1% and then retracing those gains over the next 24 hours. If bond traders were\ncompleted oblivious to what was going on in the currency markets, they would have\nprobably found themselves dumbstruck in face of such rapid gyration in yields.\n■Chinese Yuan Revaluation and Bonds\nFor Treasury traders, there’s another currency-related issue that is important to\nfollow and that is the gradual revaluation of the Chinese yuan. For most of its history,\nthe yuan or renminbi (RMB) was pegged to the U.S. dollar. In the 1980s, the RMB\nwas devalued to promote growth in C hina’s economy, and between 1997 and 2005\nthe People’s Bank of China artiﬁcially maintained a USDRMB rate of 8.27. At the\ntime, it received signiﬁcant criticism because keeping the peg meant that the Chinese\ngovernment would artiﬁcially weaken its currency to make Chinese goods more\ncompetitive. To maintain the band, the Chinese government had to sell the yuan and\nbuy U.S. dollars each time their currency appreciated above the band’s upper limit.\nThese dollars were then used to purchase U.S. Treasuries, and this practice turned\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET4China into the world’s largest holder of U.S. Treasuries. In 2005, however, China\nended its dollar peg and linked the value of the yuan to a basket of currencies and\nallowed it to ﬂuctuate within a narrow band that was reset every day. While the exact\npercentage of the basket is unknown, it is largely dominated by the U.S. dollar and\nincludes other currencies such as the euro, Japanese yen, South Korean won, British\npound, Thai baht, Russian ruble, and Australian, Canadian, and Singapore dollar.\nThrough the years China has gradually widened the band that the yuan can trade\nin, but if China were to end the ﬂoat and allow the RMB to trade freely on the\nglobal foreign exchange market, the impact on the ﬁxed-income markets would be\nsigniﬁcant because it would reduce the government’s need to purchase Treasuries\nand other ﬁxed-income securities. An announcement of this sort would send yields\nsoaring and prices tumbling. While it could be years before this happens, it will be\nimportant for bond investors to follow these developments if they want to effectively\nmanage the risk.\n■Comparing the FX Market with Futures\nand Equities\nThe foreign exchange market has not always been a popular market to trade because\nfor many decades, it was restricted to hedge funds, commodity trading advisers who\nmanage large amounts of capital, major corporations, and institutional investors\ndue to regulation, capital requirements, and technology. Yet it was the market\nof choice for many of these large players because the risk was fully customizable.\nTrader A could use a 50 times leverage, and Trader B could trade cash on cash.\nWhen the market opened up to retail traders, many brokerage ﬁrms swept in to\nprovide leveraged trading along with free instantaneous execution platforms, charts,\nand real-time news. This access to low-cost information helped foreign exchange\ntrading surge in popularity, increasing its attractiveness as an alternative asset class\nto trade.\nMany equity and futures traders also turned to currencies, adding the asset class\nto their trading portfolios. Before you choose to do so, however, it is important to\nunderstand some of the key difference s between the forex and equity markets.\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs, and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET5Characteristics of Equities Market\n1. There is decent market liquidity, but that can depend on a stock’s daily volume.\n2. The market is only available for trading 9:30am to 5pm NY Time, with limited\nafter-hours trading.\n3. The existence of exchange fees results in higher costs and commissions.\n4. There is an uptick rule to short stocks, which many day traders ﬁnd frustrating.\n5. The number of steps involved in completing a trade can increase slippage and\nerror.\nAs one of the most liquid markets in the world, the volume and liquidity present in\nthe FX markets has allowed traders to access a 24-hour market with low transaction\ncosts, high leverage, the ability to proﬁt in both bull and bear markets, minimized\nerror rates, limited slippage, and no trading curbs or uptick rules. Oftentimes, traders\ncan use the same strategies for analyzing the equity markets in the FX market. Funda-\nmental traders will ﬁnd that countries can be analyzed like stocks. Technical traders\nwill ﬁnd that the FX market is perfect for their style of analysis because of the abun-\ndance of tick data and because it is already one of the most commonly used analysis\ntools by professional traders. Now let’s take a closer look at the individual attributes\nof the FX market to really understand why this is such an attractive market to trade!\n24-Hour Market\nOne of the primary reasons why the FX market is popular is because for active\ntraders, it is the ideal market to trade. It’s 24-hour nature offers traders instant access\nto the markets at all hours of the day for immediate response to global developments.\nThis characteristic also gives traders the added ﬂexibility of determining their own\ntrading day. Active day traders no longer have to wait for the equities market to\nopen at 9:30am NY Time to begin trading. If there is a signiﬁcant announcement or\ndevelopment either domest ically or overseas bet ween 4pm NY Time and 9:30am\nNY Time, most day traders will have to wait for the exchanges to open at 9:30am\nto place trades. In all likelihood, by that time, unless you have access to electronic\ncommunication networks (ECNs) such as Instinet for premarket trading, the market\nwould have gapped up or gapped down against your favor. This is particularly\nfrustrating when important data are released at 8:30am NY Time, such as nonfarm\npayrolls. Professionals would have already priced in the outcome before the average\ntrader can even access to market.\nIn addition, many people who want to trade also have a full-time job during\nthe day. The ability to trade after hours makes the FX market a much more\nconvenient market for all traders. Different times of the day will offer different\ntrading opportunities, as the global ﬁnancial centers around the world are all actively\ninvolved in foreign exchange. With the FX m arket, trading after hours with a large\nonline FX broker provides the same liquidity and spread as any other time of day.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET6As a guideline, at 5pm Sunday NY Time, trading begins as the markets open in\nSydney, Australia. Then, the Tokyo markets open at 7 pm NY Time. Next, Singapore\nand Hong Kong open at 9pm NY Time followed by the European markets in Frankfurt\n(2am) and then London (3am). By 4am the European markets are in full swing, and\nAsia has concluded their trading day. The U.S. markets open ﬁrst in New York around\n8am Monday as Europe winds down. By 5pm, Sydney is set to reopen once again.\nThe majority of trading activity happens when the markets overlap; for example,\nAsia and Europe trading overlaps between 12am to approximately 2am, Europe and\nthe United States overlaps between 8a m to approximately 12pm NY Time, while\nthe United States and Asia overlap be tween 5pm and 9pm. During New York and\nLondon hours, all currency pairs trade actively. During the Asian hours, however,\nthe trading activity for pairs such as the GBPJPY and AUDJPY tend to peak.\nLower Transaction Costs\nLower transaction costs also makes forex an attractive asset class to trade. In the\nequity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission and with online\nequity brokers, commissions can run upwards of $20 per trade. This means that for\npositions of $100,000, average roundtrip commissions could be as high as $120.\nThe over the counter (OTC) structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which, in turn, lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Equity traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade for\nshort-term traders. For an active equity trader who typically places 30 trades a day,\nat $20 commission per trade, you would have to up to pay $600 in daily transaction\ncosts. This is a signiﬁcant amount of money that could take a large cut out of proﬁts\nor deepen losses. The reason why costs are so high is because there are a lot of\npeople involved in an equity transaction. More speciﬁcally, for each trade, there is\na broker, the exchange, and the specialist. All of these parties need to be paid, and\ntheir payment comes in the form of commission and clearing fees. In the FX market,\nbecause it is decentralized with no exchange or clearinghouse (everything is taken\ncare of by the market maker), these fees are not applicable.\nCustomizable Leverage\nEven though many people realize that higher leverage comes with risks, traders are\nhumans, and few of them ﬁnd it easy to turn away the opportunity to trade on\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET7someone else’s money. The FX market caters perfectly to these traders by offering\nthe highest leverage available for any market. Most online currency ﬁrms offer 50\ntimes leverage on regular-sized accounts and up to 200 times leverage on miniature\naccounts (abroad leverage can be as high as 400 times). Compare that to the 2 times\nleverage offered to the average equity investor and the 10 times capital that is\ntypically offered to the professional trader, and you can see why many traders have\nturned to the foreign exchange market. The margin deposit for leverage in the FX\nmarket is not seen as a down payment on a purchase of equity, as many perceive\nmargins to be in the stock markets. Rather, the margin is a performance bond, or\ngood-faith deposit, to ensure against trading losses. This is very useful to short-term\nday traders who need the enhancement in capital to generate quick returns. For the\nmore risk-averse investor, leverage is completely customizable, which means that\nif they only feel comfortable with 10 or 20 times leverage or no leverage at all,\nthey can elect to do so. It is extremely important to understand that leverage is a\ndouble-edged sword—it can magnify proﬁts but also losses.\nProﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nIn the FX market, proﬁt potentials exist in both bull and bear markets. Since\ncurrency trading always involves buying one currency and selling another, there\nis no structural bias to the market. Therefore, if you are long one currency, you\nare at the same time short another. As a result, equal proﬁt potential exists in\nboth upward-trending and downward-trending markets. This is different from the\nequities market, where most traders go long instead of short stocks, so the general\nequity investment community tends to suffer in a bear market.\nNo Trading Curbs or Uptick Rule\nThe FX market is the largest market in the world, forcing market makers to offer\nvery competitive prices. Unlike the equities market, there is never a time in the\nFX markets when trading curbs would take into effect and trading would be halted,\nonly to gap when reopened. This eliminates missed proﬁts due to archaic exchange\nregulations. In the FX market, traders would be able to place trades 24 hours a day\nwith virtually no disruptions.\nOne of the biggest annoyances for day trades in the equity market is the fact\nthat traders are prohibited from shorting a stock in a downtrend unless there is an\nuptick. This can be very frustrating as traders wait to join short sellers, but are only\nleft with continually watching the stock trend down before an uptick occurs. In the\nFX market, there is no such rule. If you want to short a currency pair, you can do\nso immediately; this allows for instant and efﬁcient execution.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET8Online Trading Reducing Error Rates\nA shorter trade process minimizes errors. Online currency trading is typically a\nthree-step process. A trader would place an order on the platform, the FX dealing\ndesk would automatically execute it electronically, and the order conﬁrmation\nwould be posted or logged onto the trader’s trading station. Typically, these three\nsteps would be completed in a matter of seconds. For an equities trade on the other\nhand, there is generally a ﬁve-step process. The client would call his broker to place\nan order, the broker sends the order to the exchange ﬂoor, the specialist on the\nﬂoor tries to match up orders (the broker competes with other brokers to get the\nbest ﬁll for the client), the specialist executes the trade, and the client receives a\nconﬁrmation from the broker. The elimination of a middleman minimizes the error\nrates in currency trades and increases the efﬁciency of each transaction.\nLimited Slippage\nUnlike the equity markets, many online FX market makers provide instantaneous\nexecution from real-time, two-way quotes. These quotes are the prices where the\nﬁrms are willing to buy or sell the quoted currency, rather than vague indications\nof where the market is trading, which may or may not be honored. Orders are\nexecuted and conﬁrmed within seconds. Robust systems would never request the\nsize of a trader’s potential order, or which side of the market he’s trading, before\ngiving him a bid/offer quote. Inefﬁcient dealers determine whether the investor is a\nbuyer or a seller, and shade the price to increase their own proﬁt on the transaction.\nThe equity market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’ system, under\nwhich you may not get executed at the price you wish, but rather at the next best\nprice available. For example, let’s say Microsoft is trading at $52.50. If you enter a\nbuy order at this rate, by the time it reaches the specialist on the exchange ﬂoor, the\nprice may have risen to $53.25. In this case, you will not get executed at $52.50;\nyou will get executed at $53.25, which is essentially a loss of 3∕4of a point. The\nprice transparency provided by the some of the better market makers assures that\ntraders always receive a fair price.\nPerfect Market for Technical Analysis\nFor technical analysts, currencies rarely spend much time in tight trading ranges and\nhave the tendency to develop strong trends. Over 80% of volume is speculative in\nnature and as a result, the market frequently overshoots and then corrects itself.\nHence, technical analysis works well for the FX market, and a technically trained\ntrader can easily identify new trends and breakouts, which provide multiple oppor-\ntunities to enter and exit positions. Charts and indicators are used by all professional\nFX market traders, and candle charts are available on most charting packages. In addi-\ntion, the most commonly used indicators such as Fibonacci retracements, stochastics,\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET9MACD, moving averages, RSI, and support/resistance levels have proven valid in\nmany instances.\nIn the USDJPY chart shown in Figure 1.1, it is clear that Fibonacci retracements,\nmoving averages, and stochastics have at one point or another given successful\ntrading signals. For example, the 61.8% retracement level served as resistance for\nUSDJPY in December 2014, January 2015, and February 2015. The moving-average\ncrossovers of the 10- and 20-day simple moving averages also successfully forecasted\nthe rally in USDJPY in late October, along with the decline in early January. Equity\ntraders who focus on technical analysis have the easiest transition, since they can\nimplement the same technical strategies that they use in the equities market into the\nFX market.\nAnalyze Stocks Like Countries\nTrading currencies is not a big challenge for fundamental traders either, because\ncountries can be analyzed like stocks. For example, if you analyze growth rates of\nstocks, you can use gross domestic product (GDP) to analyze the growth rate of\ncountries. If you analyze inventory and production ratios, you can follow industrial\nproduction (IP) or durable goods data. If you follow sales ﬁgures, you can analyze\nretail sales data. As with a stock investme n t ,i ti sb e t t e rt oi n v e s ti nt h ec u r r e n c yo fa\ncountry that is growing faster and fund it with a currency of a country that is growing\nslower. Currency prices reﬂect the balance of supply and demand for currencies.\nTwo of the primary factors affecting supply and demand of currencies are interest\nrates and the overall strength of the economy. Economic indicators such as GDP,\nforeign investment, and the trade balance reﬂect the general health of an economy\nand are therefore responsible for the underlying shifts in supply and demand for\nthat currency. There is a tremendous amount of data released at regular intervals,\nsome of which are more important than others. Data related to interest rates and\ninternational trade is the most closely followed.\nIf there is uncertainty regarding the direction of interest rates, any bit of news\non monetary policy can directly affect how the currency trades. Traditionally,\nif a country raises its interest rate, the currency of that country will strengthen\nin relation to other countries as investors shift assets to that country to gain a\nhigher return. In contrast, an interest rates hike is generally bad news for stocks\nbecause it means that borrowing costs have risen. In response, some investors will\ntransfer money out of a country’s stock market when interest rates are increased,\ncausing the country’s currency to weaken. Determining which effect dominates can\nbe tricky, but generally there is an advance consensus on how interest rates will\nmove. Indicators that have the biggest impact on interest rates are producer prices,\nconsumer prices, employment, spending, and GDP. Most of the time monetary\npolicy announcements are known in advance with meeting dates by the Bank of\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET10\nFIGURE 1.1 USDJPY Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET11England (BoE), the Federal Reserve (FED), European Central Bank (ECB), Bank\nof Japan (BoJ), and other central banks posted on their respective websites.\nAnother piece of data that can impact how currencies move is the trade balance,\nwhich shows the net differ ence over a period of time b etween a nation’s exports and\nimports. When a country imports more than it exports, the trade balance will show\na deﬁcit, which is generally considered unfavorable. For example, if U.S. dollars are\nsold for other domestic national currencies (to pay for imports), the ﬂow of dollars\noutside the country will depreciate the value of the dollar. Similarly, if trade ﬁgures\nshow an increase in exports, dollars will ﬂow into the United States and appreciate\nthe value of the dollar. From the standpoint of a national economy, a deﬁcit in and of\nitself is not necessarily a bad thing. If the deﬁcit is greater than market expectations\nhowever, it can trigger a negative price movement.\n■FX versus Futures\nTrading spot forex is also different from trading futures, and like equity traders,\nmany futures traders have also added currency spot trading into their portfolios. We\nknow that the spot forex market has the following attributes:\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nCharacteristics of Futures Markets\n1. There is limited market liquidity depending on the month of contract trades.\n2. The presence of exchange fees results in more costs and commissions.\n3. Market hours for futures trading are much shorter than spot and are dependent\non the product traded; each product may have different open and closing hours,\nand there is limited after-hours trading.\n4. Futures leverage is higher than equities, but still only a fraction of the leverage\noffered in FX.\n5. There tends to be prolonged bear markets.\n6. Pit trading structure increases error and slippage.\nLike in the equities market, traders can implement the same strategies they use\nin analyzing the futures markets in the FX m arket. Most future tr aders are technical\ntraders, and the FX market is perfect for technical analysis. In fact, it is the most\npopular analysis technique used by professional FX traders. Taking a closer look at\nhow the futures market stacks up, we see the following.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET12Comparing Market Hours and Liquidity\nThe volume traded in the FX market is estimated to be over ﬁve times that of the\nfutures market. The FX market is open for trading 24 hours a day, but the futures\nmarket has confusing market hours which vary based on the product traded. For\nexample, if you traded gold futures, it is only open for trading between 7:20am\nand 1:30pm on the COMEX. If you traded crude oil futures on the New York\nMercantile Exchange, t rading would only be ope n between 8:30am. and 2:10pm.\nThese varying hours not only create confusion but also makes it difﬁcult to act on\nbreakthrough announcements throughout the reminder of the day.\nIn addition, if you have a day job and can only trade after hours, futures would be\na very inconvenient market product to trade. You would basically be placing orders\nbased on past prices that are not current market prices. This lack of transparency\nmakes trading very cumbersome. In addition, each time zone has its own unique\nnews and developments that could move speciﬁc currency pairs, and with futures it\ncan difﬁcult to act on breaking overnight news.\nLow to Zero Transaction Costs\nIn the equity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission. With future\nbrokers, average commissions can run close to $160 per trade on positions of\n$100,000 or greater. The OTC structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which can in turn lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight,\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Futures traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow to zero transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade\nfor short-term traders. If you are an active futures trader who typically places 20\ntrades a day, at $100 commission per trade, you would have to pay $2,000 in daily\ntransaction costs. A typical futures trade involves a broker, a future commissions\nmerchant (FCM) order desk, a clerk on the exchange ﬂoor, a runner, and a pit\ntrader. All of these parties need to be paid, and their payment comes in the form of\ncommission and clearing fees, whereas the electronic nature of the market minimizes\nthese costs.\nNo Limit Up or Down Rules/Proﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nUnlike the tight restriction on the futures market, there is no limit down or limit\nup rule in the FX market. For example, on the S&P index futures, if the contract\nvalue falls more than 5% from the previous day’s close, limit down rules will come\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET13in effect, whereby on a 5% move, the index would only be allowed to trade at\nor above this level for the next 10 minutes. For a 20% decline, trading would be\ncompletely halted. Due to the decentralized nature of the FX market, there are no\nexchange-enforced restrictions on daily activity, which can help eliminate missed\nopportunities caused by archaic exchange regulations.\nExecution Quality and Speed/Low Error Rates\nThe futures market is also known for inconsistent execution, both in terms of pricing\nand execution time. Every futures trader has, at some point in time, experienced\na half hour or so wait for a market order to be ﬁlled, only to ﬁnd that the order\nhas been executed at a price far away from where the market was trading when\nthe initial order was placed. Even with electronic trading and limited guarantees of\nexecution speed, the price for ﬁlls on market orders is far from certain. The reason\nfor this inefﬁciency is the number of steps that are involved in placing a futures\ntrade. A futures trade is typically a seven-step process:\n1. The client calls his broker and places his trade (or places it online).\n2. The trading desk receives the order, processes it, and routes it to the FCM\norder desk on the exchange ﬂoor.\n3. The FCM order desk passes the order to the order clerk.\n4. The order clerk hands the order to a runner or signals it to the pit.\n5. The trading clerk goes to the pit to execute the trade.\n6. The trade conﬁrmation goes to the runner or is signaled to the order clerk and\nprocessed by the FCM order desk.\n7. The broker receives the trade conﬁrmation and passes it on to the client.\nAn FX trade in comparison is typically only a three-step process. A trader would\nplace an order on the platform, the FX dealing desk would automatically execute\nit electronically, and the order conﬁrmation would be posted or logged on the\ntrader’s trading station. The elimination of the involvement of these additional\nparties increases the speed of the trade execution and decreases errors.\nIn addition, the futures market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’\nsystem, under which your trades frequently do not get executed at the initial market\norder price, but rather, at the next best price available. For example, let’s say a\nclient is long 5 March Dow Jones futures contracts at 8800. If the client enters a\nstop order at 8700, when the rate reaches this level, the client will most likely be\nexecuted at 8690. This 10-point difference would be attributed to slippage, which\nis very common in the futures market.\nOn most FX trading stations, traders execute directly off of real-time streaming\nprices. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, there is generally no discrepancy\nbetween the displayed price and the execution price. This holds true even during\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET14volatile times and fast-moving markets. In the futures market, execution is uncertain\nbecause all orders must be done on the exchange. This creates a situation where\nliquidity is limited by the number of participants, which, in turn, limits quantities\nthat can be traded at a given price. Real-time streaming prices ensure that market\norders, stops, and limits are executed with minimal slippage and no partial ﬁlls.\n■W h oA r et h eP l a y e r si nt h eF XM a r k e t ?\nSince the foreign exchange market is an OTC market without a centralized exchange,\ncompetition between market makers prohibits monopolisti c pricing strategies. If\none market maker attempts to drastically skew the price, then traders simply have\nthe option to ﬁnd another market maker. Moreover, spreads are closely watched to\nensure market makers are not whimsically altering the cost of the trade. Many equity\nmarkets, on the other hand, operate in a completely different fashion; the New York\nStock Exchange, for instance, is the sole place where companies listed on the NYSE\ncan have their stocks traded. Centralized markets are operated by what are referred\nto as specialists. Market makers, on the other hand, is the term used in reference to\ndecentralized marketplaces. Since the NYSE is a centralized market, a stock traded\non the NYSE can only have one bid–ask quote at all times. Decentralized markets,\nsuch as foreign exchange, can have multiple market makers—all of whom have the\nright to quote different prices. Here is an illustration of how both centralized and\ndecentralized markets operate.\nCentralized Markets\nBy their very nature, centralized markets tend to be monopolistic: With a single\nspecialist controlling th e market, prices can easil y be skewed to a ccommodate the\ninterests of the specialist, not those of the traders (see Figure 1.2). If, for example,\nthe market is ﬁlled with sellers that the specialists must buy from but no prospective\nbuyers on the other side, the specialist may simply widen the spread, thereby\nBuyers\nCan buy only\nfrom one\nspecialistSpecialist\nUnites buyers and\nsellers; maintains\nsole control over\nthe spreadSellers\nCan sell only to\none specialist\nFIGURE 1.2 Centralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET15increasing the cost of the trade and preventing additional participants from entering\nthe market. Or, specialists can drastically alter the quotes they are offering, thus\nmanipulating the price to accommodate their own risk tolerance.\nHierarchy of Participants\nWhile the foreign exchange market is decentralized, and hence employs multiple\nmarket makers rather than a single specialist, participants in the FX market are\norganized into a hierarchy; those with superior credit access, volume transacted,\nand sophistication receive priority pricing in the market (see Figure 1.3). At the\ntop of the food chain is the interbank market, which trades the highest volume per\nday in relatively few currencies. In the interbank market, the largest banks can deal\nwith each other directly, via interbank brokers, or through electronic brokering\nsystems like EBS or Reuters. The interbank market is a credit-approved system,\nwhere banks trade based solely on the credit relationships they have established\nwith one another. The banks can see the rates everyone is dealing at, but each bank\nmust have a speciﬁc credit relationship with that bank in order to trade at the rates\nbeing offered. Other institutions such as online FX market makers, hedge funds,\nand corporations must trade FX through these banks, although some have created\ntheir own liquidity pools through the years. Many banks (e.g., small community\nbanks or banks in emerging markets), corporations, and institutional investors do\nnot have access to these rates because they have no established credit lines with\nbig banks. This forces smaller participants to deal through just one bank for their\nRetail Clients\nTrader\nTrader\nTrader\nTraderOnline TradingInterbank Market\nBank Bank\nBank BankEBS and\nReutersOnline FX\nMarket\nMakers\nFIGURE 1.3 Decentralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET16foreign exchange needs, and oftentimes this means much less competitive rates for\nthe participants further down the participant hierarchy. Those receiving the least\ncompetitive rates are customers of banks and physical currency exchange companies.\nRecently, technology has broken down the barriers that used to stand between the\nend-users of foreign exchange services and the interbank market. The online trading\nrevolution opened its doors to retail clientele by connecting market makers and\nmarket participants in an efﬁcient, low-cost manner. In essence, online trading\nplatforms serve as a gateway to the liquid FX market. Average traders can now\ntrade alongside the biggest banks in the world, with virtually similar pricing and\nexecution. What used to be a game dominated and controlled by the ‘‘big boys’’ is\nslowly becoming a level playing ﬁeld where individuals can proﬁt and take advantage\nof the same opportunities as big banks. FX is no longer an old boys club, which\nmeans opportunities abound for aspiring online currency traders.\nDealing Stations— Interbank Market\nFor serious traders who want to know more about the interbank market, the\nmajority of FX volume is actually transacted primarily through the interbank\nmarket. The leading banks of the world trade with each other electronically\nover two platforms—the EBS and Reuters, dealing 3000-spot matching. Both\nplatforms offer trading in the major currency pairs; however, certain currency\npairs are more liquid and generally more frequently traded over one versus the\nother. Some cross-currency pairs are traded over these platforms as well, but\nothers are calculated from the rates of the major currency pairs and are then offset\nusing the ‘‘legs.’’ For example, if an interbank trader had a client who wanted to\ngo long NZDCAD, the trader would most likely buy NZDUSD and USDCAD\nseparately. The trader would then multiply these rates and provide the client with\nthe respective NZDCAD rate, creating a synthetic quote and trade.\n17CHAPTER 2\nHistorical Events in\nthe FX Markets\nBefore learning how to trade currencies, it is important for every new and\nseasoned market participant to have some understanding about the most\nimportant historical events that have shaped the currency market. To this day, these\nevents are often referenced by professional traders.\n■Bretton Woods: Anointing the Dollar as the World\nCurrency (1944)\nIn July 1944, representatives of 44 nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire,\nto create a new institutional arrangement for governing the international economy\nin the years following World War II. Most agreed that international economic\ninstability was one of the principle causes of the war, and that such instability needed\nto be prevented in the future. The agreement, which was developed by renowned\neconomists John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White, was initially proposed\nto Great Britain as a part of the Lend Lease Act—an American act designed to assist\nGreat Britain in postwar redevelopment efforts. After various negotiations, the ﬁnal\nform of the Bretton Woods Agreement consisted of three key items:\n1. The formation of key international authorities designed to promote fair trade\nand international economic harmony\n2. The ﬁxation of exchange rates between currencies\n3. The convertibility between gold and t he U.S. dollar, thus empowering the U.S.\ndollar as the reserve currency of choice for the world\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS18Of these three parameters, only the ﬁrst is still in existence today, but the\norganizations formed as a direct result of Bretton Woods include the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT); and they all play a crucial role in modern day development and regulation\nof international economies. Since the demise of Bretton Woods, the IMF has\nworked closely with the World Bank. Toge ther, the two institutions now regularly\nlend funds to developing nations, assisting them in the development of a public\ninfrastructure capable of supporting a sound mercantile economy that can contribute\nin the international arena. In order to ensure that these nations can actually enjoy\nequal and legitimate access to trade with their industrialized counterparts, the World\nBank and IMF must work closely with GATT. While GATT was initially meant to\nbe a temporary organization, it now operates to encourage the dismantling of trade\nbarriers—namely, tariffs and quotas.\nThe Bretton Woods Agreement existed from 1944 to 1971, after which it\nwas replaced by the Smithsonian Agreement, an international contract pioneered\nby U.S. President Richard Nixon out the necessity to accommodate for Bretton\nWoods’ shortcomings. Unfortunately, the Smithsonian Agreement possessed the\nsame critical weakness: While it did not include gold/U.S. dollar convertibility,\nit maintained ﬁxed exchange rates—a facet that did not accommodate the United\nStates’ ongoing trade deﬁcit and the international need for a weaker U.S. dollar. As\na result, the Smithsonian Agreement was short-lived.\nUltimately, the exchange rates of t he world evolved into a free market,\nwhere supply and demand were the sole criteria that determined the value of a\ncurrency. While this did and still does result in a number of currency crises and\ngreater volatility between currencies, it also allowed the market to become self-\nregulating, and thus could dictate the appropriate value of a currency without any\nhindrances.\nAs for Bretton Woods, perhaps its most memorable contribution to the interna-\ntional economic arena was its role in changing the international perception about the\nU.S. dollar. While the euro is a revolutionary currency blazing new frontiers in both\nsocial behavior and international trade, the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve\ncurrency of choice. This is due, in large part, to the Bretton Woods Agreement:\nBy establishing dollar/gold convertibility, the dollar’s role as the world’s most\naccessible and reliable currency was ﬁrmly cemented. So while Bretton Woods\nmight be a doctrine of yesteryear, its impact on the U.S. dollar and international\neconomics still resonates today.\n■The End of Bretton Woods: Free Market\nCapitalism Is Born (1971)\nOn August 15, 1971, it became ofﬁcial: The Bretton-Woods system was abandoned\nonce and for all. While it had been exorcised before—only to subsequently emerge\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS19in a new form—this ﬁnal eradication of the Bretton Woods system was truly its\nlast stand: No longer would currencies be ﬁxed in value to gold, allowed only to\nﬂuctuate in a 1% range, but instead, their fair valuation could be determined by\nfree-market behavior such as trade ﬂows and foreign direct investment.\nAlthough U.S. President Nixon was conﬁdent that the end of the Bretton Woods\nsystem would bring about better times for the international economy, he was\nnot a believer that the free market could dictate a currency’s true valuation in a\nfair and catastrophe-free manner. Nixon and many well-respected economists at\nthe time reasoned that an entirely unstructured foreign exchange market would\nresult in competing devaluations, which, in turn, would lead to the breakdown of\ninternational trade and investment. The end result, Nixon and his board of economic\nadvisors argued, would be global depression.\nIn response, the Smithsonian Agreement was introduced a few months later.\nHailed by President Nixon as the ‘‘greatest monetary agreement in the history of\nthe world,’’ the Smithsonian Agreement strived to maintain ﬁxed exchange rates\nwithout the backing of gold. Its key difference from the Bretton Woods system was\nthat the value of the dollar could ﬂoat in a range of 2.25%, compared to just 1%\nunder Bretton Woods.\nUltimately, the Smithsonian Agreement proved to be unfeasible as well. Without\nexchange rates ﬁxed to gold, the free market gold price shot up to $215 per\nounce. Moreover, the U.S. trade deﬁcit continued to grow, and from a fundamental\nstandpoint, the U.S. dollar needed to be devalued beyond the 2.25% parameters\nestablished by the Smithsonian Agreement. In light of these problems, the foreign\nexchange markets were forced to close in February 1972.\nThe markets reopened in March 1973, and this time, they were not bound by a\nSmithsonian Agreement: The value of the US dollar was to be determined entirely\nby the market, as its value was not ﬁxed to any commodity, nor was its exchange rate\nﬂuctuation conﬁned to certain parameters. While this did provide the U.S. dollar,\nand other currencies by default, the agility required to adapt to a new and rapidly\nevolving international trading environment, it also set the stage for unprecedented\ninﬂation. The end of Bretton Woods and the Smithsonian Agreement, as well as\nconﬂicts in the Middle East, resulted in substantially higher oil prices and helped\nto create stagﬂation—the synthesis of unemployment and inﬂation—in the U.S.\neconomy. It would not be until later in the decade, when Federal Reserve Chairman\nPaul Volcker initiated new economic policies and President Reagan introduced a new\nﬁscal agenda, that the U.S. dollar would return to ‘‘normal’’ valuations. By then,\nthe foreign exchange markets had thoroughly developed and were capable of serving\na multitude of purposes. In addition to employing a laissez-faire style of regulation\non international trade, they also were beginning to attract speculators seeking to\nparticipate in a market with unrivaled liquidity and continued growth. Ultimately,\nthe death of Bretton Woods in 1971 marked the beginning of a new economic era, one\nthat liberated international trading while also proliferating speculative opportunities.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS20■Plaza Accord—Devaluation\nof the U.S. Dollar (1985)\nAfter the demise of all the various exchange rate regulatory mechanisms that\ncharacterized the twentieth century—t hat is, the Gold Standard, the Bretton\nWoods Standard, and the Smithsonian Agreement—the currency market was left\nwith virtually no regulation other than the mythical ‘‘invisible hand’’ of free\nmarket capitalism, one that supposedly strived to create economic balance through\nsupply and demand. Unfortunately, due to a number of unforeseen economic\nevents—such as the OPEC oil crises, stagﬂation throughout the 1970s, and drastic\nchanges in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ﬁscal policy—supply and demand, in and\nof themselves, became insufﬁcient means by which the currency markets could be\nregulated. A system of sorts was needed, but not one that was inﬂexible: Fixation of\ncurrency values to a commodity, such as gold, proved to be too rigid for economic\ndevelopment, as was also the notion of ﬁxing maximum exchange rate ﬂuctuations.\nThe balance between structure and rigidity was one that had plagued the currency\nmarkets throughout the twentieth century, and while advancements had been made,\na deﬁnitive solution was still greatly needed.\nHence, in 1985, the respective ministers of ﬁnance and central bank governors\nof the world’s leading economies—France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom,\nand the United States—convened in New York City, with the hopes of arranging a\ndiplomatic agreement that would work to optimize the economic effectiveness of\nthe foreign exchange markets. Meeting at the Plaza Hotel, the international leaders\ncame to the following agreements regarding speciﬁc economies and the international\neconomy as a whole:\n■Across the world, inﬂation was at very low levels. Contrary to the stagﬂation of\nthe 1970s—where inﬂation was high and real economic growth was low—the\nglobal economy in 1985 had done a complete 180, as inﬂation was now low and\ngrowth was strong.\n■While low inﬂation, even when coupled with robust economic growth, still\nallowed for low interest rates—a caveat that developing countries particularly\nenjoyed—there was an imminent danger of protectionist policies such as tariffs\nentering the economy. The United States was experiencing a large and growing\ncurrent account deﬁcit, while Japan and Germany were facing large and growing\nsurpluses. An imbalance so fundamental in nature could create serious economic\ndisequilibrium, which, in turn, would result in a distortion of the foreign exchange\nmarkets, and thus, the international economy as a whole.\n■The results of current account imbalances, and the protectionist policies that\nensued, required action. Ultimately, it was believed that the rapid acceleration\nin the value of the U.S. dollar, which appreciated more than 80% against the\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS21currencies of its major trading partners, was the primary culprit. The rising\nvalue of the U.S. dollar created enormous trade deﬁcits, hurting many different\neconomies.\nAt the meeting in the Plaza Hotel, the Uni ted States persuad ed other attending\ncountries to coordinate a multilateral intervention, and on September 22, 1985,\nthe Plaza Accord was implemented. This agreement was designed to allow for\na controlled decline of the dollar and the appreciation of the main anti-dollar\ncurrencies. Each country agreed to changes to their economic policies and to\nintervene in currency markets as necessary to weaken the value of the dollar. The\nUnited States agreed to cut its budget deﬁcit and lower interest rates. France, the\nUnited Kingdom, Germany, and Japan agreed to raise interest rates. Germany also\nagreed to tax cuts, while Japan agreed to let the value of the yen ‘‘fully reﬂect\nthe underlying strength of the Japanese economy.’’ However, one major problem\nwas that not every country adhered to their pledges made under the Plaza Accord.\nThe United States, in particular, did not follow through with its initial promise to\ncut the budget deﬁcit. Japan was severely hurt by the sharp rise in the yen, as its\nexporters were unable to remain competitive overseas, and it is argued that this\neventually triggered a 10-year recession in Japan. The United S tates, on the other\nhand, enjoyed considerable growth and price stability as a result of the agreement.\nThe effects of the multilateral intervention were seen immediately, and within\nless than two years, the dollar fell 46% and 50% against the German deutschemark\nand the Japanese yen, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.1.

This gradually resolved\nthe current account deﬁcits for the time being, and also ensured that protectionist\npolicies were minimal and nonthreatening. But perhaps most importantly, the\nPlaza Accord cemented the role of the central banks in regulating exchange rate\nmovement—yes, the rates would not be ﬁxed, and hence would be determined\nprimarily by supply and demand; but ultimately, such an invisible hand is insufﬁcient,\nand it was the right and responsibility of the world’s central banks to intervene on\nbehalf of the international economy when necessary.\n■George Soros—The Man Who Broke the Bank\nof England\nWhen George Soros placed a $10 billion speculative bet on the UK pound and\nwon, he became universally known as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England.’’\nWhether you love him or hate him, Soros led the charge in one of the most\nfascinating events in currency trading history. Here are the details.\nThe UK Joins the Exchange Rate Mechanism\nIn 1979, a Franco-German initiative set up the European Monetary System (EMS) to\nstabilize exchange rates, reduce inﬂation, and prepare for monetary integration. The\nExchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), one of the EMS’s main components, gave each\nparticipatory currency a central exchange rate against a basket of currencies, the\nEuropean Currency Unit (ECU). Participants (initially France, Germany, Italy, the\nNetherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and Luxemburg) were then required to\nmaintain their exchange rates within a 2.25% ﬂuctuation band above or below each\nbilateral central rate. The ERM was an adjustable-peg system, and nine realignments\nwould occur between 1979 and 1987. Whil e the United Kingdom was not one of\nthe original members, it would eventually join in 1990 at a rate of DM2.95 to the\npound and with a ﬂuctuation band of +/–6%.\nUntil mid-1992, the ERM appeared to be a success, as a disciplinary effect\nhad reduced inﬂation throughout Europe under the leadership of the German\nBundesbank. The stability wouldn’t last, however, as international investors started\nworrying that the exchange rate values of several currencies within the ERM\nwere inappropriate. Following German reuniﬁcation in 1989 government spending\nsurged, forcing the Bundesbank to print more money. This led to high inﬂation\nand left the German central bank with little choice but to increase interest rates.\nHowever, the rate hike came with consequences as it placed upward pressure on\nthe German mark. This forced other central banks to raise their interest rates as\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS23well as to maintain their pegged currency exchange rates (a direct application of\nIrving Fischer’s interest parity theory). Realizing that the UK’s weak economy and\nhigh unemployment rate would not permit the British government to maintain this\npolicy for long, George Soros stepped into action.\nSoros Bets Against the Success of UK Involvement in the ERM\nThe quantum hedge fund manager essentially wanted to bet that the pound would\ndepreciate because the United Kingdom would either devalue the pound or leave the\nERM. Thanks to the progressive removal of capital controls during the EMS years,\ninternational investors at the time had more freedom than ever to take advantage\nof perceived disequilibria, so Soros established short positions in pounds and long\npositions in marks by borrowing pounds and investing in mark-denominated assets.\nHe also made great use of options and futures. In all, his positions accounted for\na gargantuan $10 billion. Soros was not the only one; many other investors soon\nfollowed suit. Everyone was selling pounds, placing tremendous downward pressure\non the currency.\nAt ﬁrst, the Bank of England (BoE) tried to defend the pegged rates by buying\n15 billion pounds with its large reserve assets, but its sterilized interventions\n(whereby the monetary base is held constant thanks to open market interventions)\nwere limited in their effectiveness. The pound was trading dangerously close to the\nlower levels of its ﬁxed band. On September 16, 1992, a day that would later be\nknown as Black Wednesday, the bank announced a 2% rise in interest rates (from\n10% to 12%) in an attempt to boost the pound’s appeal. A few hours later, it\npromised to raise rates again to 15%, but international investors such as Soros could\nnot be swayed, knowing that huge proﬁts were right around the corner. Traders\nkept selling pounds in huge volumes, and the BoE kept buying them until, ﬁnally, at\n7:00 pm that same day, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced that Britain would\nleave the ERM and that rates would return to their initial level of 10%. The chaotic\nBlack Wednesday marked the beginning of a steep depreciation in the pound’s\neffective value.\nWhether the return to a ﬂoating currency was due to the Soros-led attack on\nthe pound or because of simple fundamental analysis is still debated today. What\nis certain, however, is that the pound’s depreciation of almost 15% against the\ndeutschemark and 25% against the dollar over the next ﬁve weeks as seen in Figure 2.2\nand Figure 2.3 resulted in tremendous proﬁts for Soros and others traders (the pound\nalso weakened by a similar proportion to the dollar). Within a month, the quantum\nfund cashed in on approximately $2 billion by selling the now more expensive\nDMs and buying back the now cheaper pounds. ‘‘The man who broke the Bank of\nEngland’’ showed how central banks can still be vulnerable to speculative attacks.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS243.00British Pound vs. Deutschemark (GBPDEM)\n2.90\n2.80\n2.70\n2.60\n2.50\n2.40\n2.30\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.2 GBPDEM after Soros\n2.10\n2.00\n1 .90\n1 .80\n1 .70\n1 .60\n1 .50\n1 .40British Pound Against US Dollar GBPUSD\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.3 GBPUSD after Soros\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS25■Asian Financial Crisis (1997–1998)\nFalling like a set of dominos on July 2, 1997, the relatively nascent Asian tiger\neconomies provide the perfect example of the interdependence in global capital\nmarkets and their subsequent effects throughout international currency forums.\nBased on several fundamental breakdowns, the cause of the ‘‘contagion’’ stemmed\nlargely from shrouded lending practices, inﬂated trade deﬁcits, and immature capital\nmarkets. Compiled, these factors contributed to a perfect storm that left major\nregional markets incapacitated and once-prized currencies devalued to signiﬁcantly\nlower levels. With adverse effects easily seen in the equities markets, currency\nmarket ﬂuctuations were negatively impacted in much the same manner during this\ntime period.\nThe Bubble\nLeading up to 1997, investors had become increasingly attracted to Asian investment\nprospects, focusing on real estate development and domestic equities. As a result,\nforeign investment capital ﬂowed into the region as economic growth rates climbed\non improved production in countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and\nKorea. Thailand, home of the baht, experienced a 6.5% growth rate in 1996, falling\nfrom 13% in 1988. Lending additional support for a stronger economy was the\nenactment of a ﬁxed currency peg to the U.S. dollar. With a ﬁxed valuation to\nthe greenback, countries like Thailand could ensure ﬁnancial stability in their own\nmarkets and a constant rate for export trading purposes with the world’s largest\neconomy. Ultimately, the region’s national currencies appreciated, as underlying\nfundamentals were justiﬁed and increased speculative positions of further climbs in\nprice mounted.\nBallooning Current Account Deﬁcits and Nonperforming Loans\nHowever, in early 1997, a shift in sentiment began to occur as international account\ndeﬁcits became increasingly difﬁcult for respective governments to handle and\nlending practices were revealed to be detrimental to the economic infrastructure. In\nparticular, economists were alerted to the fact that Thailand’s current account deﬁcit\nballooned in 1996 to $14.7 billion and had been climbing since 1992. Although\ncomparatively smaller than the U.S. deﬁcit, the gap represented 8% of the country’s\ngross domestic product. Shrouded lending practices also contributed heavily to\nthese breakdowns, as close personal relationships with high-ranking banking ofﬁcials\nwere well rewarded and surprisingly common throughout the region. In particular\nthis affected many of South Korea’s highly leveraged conglomerates as total\nnonperforming loan values skyrocketed to 7.5 percent of gross domestic product.\nAdditional evidence of these practices could be observed in ﬁnancial institutions\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS26throughout Japan. First announcing questionable and nonperforming loans of\n$136 billion in 1994, Japanese authorities admitted to an alarming $400 billion\ntotal a year later. Coupled with a then-crippled stock market, cooling real estate\nvalues, and dramatic slowdowns in the economy, investors saw opportunity in\na depreciating yen, subsequently adding selling pressure to neighbor currencies.\nWhen their own asset bubble collapsed, asset prices fell by $10 trillion, with\nthe fall in real estate prices accounting for nearly 65% of the total decline—the\nlosses were worth two years of national output. This fall in asset prices sparked\nthe banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early 1990s and then developed into a\nfull-blown, systemic crisis in 1997, following the failure of a number of high-proﬁle\nﬁnancial institutions. In response, Japanese monetary authorities issued rhetoric on\npotentially increasing benchmark interest rates in hopes of defending the domestic\ncurrency valuation. Unfortunately, these considerations never materialized and a\nshortfall ensued. Sparked mainly by an announcement of a managed ﬂoat of the Thai\nbaht, the slide snowballed as central bank reserves evaporated and currency price\nlevels became unsustainable in light of downside selling pressure.\nCurrency Crisis\nFollowing mass short speculation and attempted intervention, the aforementioned\nAsian economies were left ruined and momentarily incapacitated. The Thailand baht,\na once-prized possession, was devalued by as much as 48 percent, even slumping\ncloser to a 100% fall at the turn of the new year. The most adversely affected was\n01/01/97 02/01/97 03/01/97 04/01/97 05/01/97 06/01/97 07/01/97 08/01/97 09/01/97 10/01/97 11/01/97 12/01/97 01/01/98 02/01/98 03/01/98 04/01/9860\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0140001997–98 Asian Currency Fluctuations\n12000\n10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0Thailand Baht Indonesia Rupiah\nFIGURE 2.4 Asian Crisis Price Action\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS27150USDJPY During Asian Crisis\n145\n140\n135\n130\n125\n120\n115\n110\n105\n100\n5/3/19966/3/19967/3/19968/3/19969/3/199610/3/199611/3/199612/3/19961/3/19972/3/19973/3/19974/3/19975/3/19976/3/19977/3/19978/3/19979/3/199710/3/199711/3/199712/3/19971/3/19982/3/19983/3/19984/3/19985/3/19986/3/1998\nFIGURE 2.5 USDJPY Asian Crisis Price Action\nthe Indonesian rupiah.

Additionally, it\nshowed the inability of central banks to successfully intervene in currency valuations\nwith the absence of secure economic fundamentals and overwhelming market forces.\nToday, with the assistance of IMF reparation packages and the implementation of\nstricter requirements, Asia’s four little dragons are healthy once again. With inﬂa-\ntionary benchmarks and a revived exporting market, Southeast Asia is building back\nits once prominent stature among the world’s industrialized economic regions. With\nthe experience of evaporating currency reserves under their belt, the Asian tigers\nnow take active initiatives to ensure that there is large pot of reserves on hand in\ncase speculators attempt to attack their currencies once again.\n■Introduction of the Euro (1999)\nThe introduction of the euro was a monumental achievement, marking the largest\nmonetary changeover ever. The euro was ofﬁcially launched as an electronic trading\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS28currency on January 1, 1999. Euro notes and coins were put into circulation in 2002.\nThe 11 initial member states were: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy,\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, and Finland. As of 2015, there\nare 17 countries in the Eurozone. Each country ﬁxed its currency to a speciﬁc\nconversion rate against the euro, and a common monetary policy governed by the\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) was adopted. To many economists, the system would\nideally include all of the original 15 EU nations, but the United Kingdom, Sweden,\nand Denmark decided to keep their own currencies. In deciding whether to adopt\nthe euro, EU members have many important factors to consider.\nThe 1993 Maastricht Treaty sets out ﬁve main convergence criteria for member\nstates to participate in the European Monetary Union (EMU):\nMaastricht Treaty: C onvergence Criteria\n■The country’s government budget deﬁcit could not be greater than 3% of GDP.\n■The country’s government debt could not be larger than 60% of GDP.\n■The country’s exchange rate had to be maintained within ERM bands without any\nrealignment for two years prior to joining.\n■The country’s inﬂation rate could not be higher than 1.5% above the average\ninﬂation rate of the three EU countries with the lowest inﬂation rates.\n■The country’s long-term interest rate on government bonds could not be higher\nthan 2% above the average of the comparable rates in the three countries with the\nlowest inﬂation.\nAlthough the ease of traveling is one of the most attractive reasons to join the\neuro, being part of the monetary union provides other beneﬁts:\n■It eliminates exchange rate ﬂuctuations, providing a more stable environment to\ntrade within the euro area.\n■The purging of all exchange rate risk within the zone allows businesses to plan\ninvestment decisions with greater certainty.\n■Transaction costs also diminish, mainly those relating to foreign exchange\noperations, hedging operations, cross-border payments, and the management of\nseveral currency accounts.\n■Prices become more transparent as consumers and businesses can compare prices\nacross countries more easily, which, in turn, increases competition.\n■A huge single currency market becomes more attractive for foreign investors.\n■The economy’s magnitude and stability allow the ECB to control inﬂation with\nlower interest rates, thanks to increased credibility.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS\nk\nk29\nk\nk\nFIGURE 2.6 EURUSD Price Since Launch\nSource: eSignal\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS30Yet the euro is not without its limitations. Leaving aside political sovereignty\nissues, the main problem is that, by adopting the euro, a nation essentially forfeits\nany independent monetary policy. Since each country’s economy is not perfectly\ncorrelated to the EMU’s economy, a nation might ﬁnd the ECB hiking interest\nrates during a domestic recession. This can be particularly true for many of the\nsmaller nations. As a result, countries try to rely more heavily on ﬁscal policy, but\nthe efﬁciency of ﬁscal policy is limited when it is not effectively combined with\nmonetary policy. This inefﬁciency is further exacerbated by the 3% of GDP limit on\nbudget deﬁcits, as stipulated by the Stability and Growth Pact.\nSome concerns also subsist regarding the ECB’s effectiveness as a central bank.\nThe central bank strives for a 2% inﬂation target, but in the past 15 years, it strayed\naway from this level often. Also, from 1999 to late 2002, a lack of conﬁdence\nin the union’s currency (and in the union itself) led to a 24% depreciation, from\napproximately $1.15 to the euro in January 1999 to $0.88 in May 2000, forcing\nthe ECB to intervene in foreign exchange markets in the last few months of 2000.\nFigure 2.6 shows a daily chart of the euro since it was launched in 1999.\nSince 2000, things have greatly changed, with the euro trading at a premium to\nthe dollar, but quantitative easing in 2014 put the currency back in a downtrend\nversus the dollar. Some analysts claim that the euro will one day replace the dollar\nas the world’s dominant international currency, and while we believe it will have a\ngreater share in reserve portfolios, we doubt that this will be likely.\n31CHAPTER 3\nWhat Moves the\nCurrency Market?\nNow that we know a little bit about the history of the forex market, let’s take a\nlook at what moves currencies. There are two primary ways to analyze ﬁnancial\nmarkets: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis is rooted\nin understanding underlying economic conditions, while technical analysis uses\nhistorical prices to predict future movements. For as long as technical analysis\nhas been around, there has been an ongoing debate as to which methodology\nis more successful. Short-term traders prefer to use technical analysis, focusing\ntheir strategies primarily on price action, while medium-term traders tend to use\nfundamental analysis to determine a currency’s current and future valuation.\nBefore implementing successful trading strategies, it is important to understand\nwhat drives the movements of currencies in the foreign exchange market. The\nbest strategies tend to be the ones that combine both fundamental and technical\nanalysis. Textbook perfect technical formations have failed too often because of\nmajor fundamental news and events like U.S. nonfarm payrolls. But trading on\nfundamentals alone can also be risky. There will oftentimes be sharp gyrations in\nthe price of currency on a day when there are no news or economic reports. This\nsuggests that the price action is driven by nothing more than ﬂows, sentiment, and\npattern formations. Therefore, it is very important for technical traders to be aware\nof the key economic data or events that are scheduled for release, and, in turn,\nfor fundamental traders to be aware of important technical levels that the general\nmarket may be focusing on.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?32■Fundamental Analysis\nFundamental analysis focuses on the economic, social, and political forces that drive\nsupply and demand. Those using fundamental analysis as a trading tool look at\nvarious macroeconomic indicators such as growth rates, interest rates, inﬂation,\nand unemployment. We outlined some of the most important economic releases\nin the ﬁrst chapter of this book. Fundamental analysts will combine all of this\ninformation to assess current and future performance. This requires a lot of work\nand thorough analysis, as there is no single set of beliefs that guides fundamental\nanalysis. Traders employing fundamental analysis need to continually keep abreast\nof news and announcements, as they can indicate potential changes to the economic,\nsocial, and political environment. All traders should be aware of the broad economic\nconditions before placing trades. This is especially important for day traders who\nare trying to make trading decisions based on news events because even though\nFederal Reserve Monetary Policy decisions are always important, if the rate move is\ncompletely priced into the market, then the actual reaction in the EURUSD could\nbe nominal.\nTaking a step back, currencies move primarily based on supply and demand.\nThat is, on the most fundamental level, a currency rallies because there is demand\nfor that currency. Regardless of whether the demand is for hedging, speculative,\nor conversion purposes, true movements are based on the need for the currency.\nCurrency values decrease when there is excess supply. Supply and demand should be\nthe real determinants for predicting future movements. However, how to predict\nsupply and demand is not as simple as many would think. There are many factors\nthat contribute to the net supply and demand for a currency. This includes capital\nﬂows, trade ﬂows, speculative, and hedging needs.\nFor example, the U.S. dollar was very strong (against the euro) between 1999\nand the end of 2001. This rally was driven primarily by the dot-com boom and the\ndesire by foreign investors to participate in these elevated returns. This demand\nfor U.S. assets required foreign investors to sell their local currencies and purchase\nU.S. dollars. Since the end of 2001, geopolitical uncertainty arose, the United States\nstarted cutting interest rates, and foreign investors started to sell U.S. assets in\nsearch of higher yields elsewhere. This required foreign investors to sell U.S. dollars,\nincreasing supply and lowering the dollar’s value against other major currency pairs.\nThe availability of funding or interest in buying a currency is a major factor that can\nimpact the direction that a currency trades. It was one of the primary drivers of the\nU.S. dollar between 2002 and 2005, making foreign ofﬁcial purchases of U.S. assets\n(also known as the Treasury International Capital Flow, or TIC data) an important\neconomic indicator.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?33Capital and Trade Flows\nCapital ﬂows and trade ﬂows constitute a country’s balance of payments, which\nquantiﬁes the amount of demand for a currency over a given period of time.\nTheoretically, a balance of payments equal to zero is required for a currency to\nmaintain its current valuation. A negative balance of payments number, on the other\nhand, indicates that capital is leaving the economy at a more rapid rate than it is\nentering, and hence, it should fall in value.\nThis is particularly important in current conditions (at the time of this book’s\npublication), where the United States is running a consistently large trade deﬁcit\nwithout sufﬁcient foreign inﬂow to fund that deﬁcit. As a result of this very problem,\nthe trade-weighted dollar index fell 22% in value between 2003 and 2005. The\nJapanese yen is another good example. As one of the world’s largest exporters, Japan\nruns a very high trade surplus. Therefore, despite a zero interest rate policy that\nprevents capital ﬂows from increasing, the yen has a natural tendency to trade lower\nbased on trade ﬂows, which is the other side of the equation. To be more speciﬁc,\nfollowing is a more detailed explanation of what capital and trade ﬂows encompass.\nCapital Flows\nCapital ﬂows measure the net amount of a currency that is being purchased or sold\ndue to capital investments. A positive capital ﬂow balance implies that foreign inﬂows\nof physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed outﬂows. A negative\ncapital ﬂow balance indicates that there are more physical or portfolio investments\nbought by domestic investors than foreign investors. There are generally two types\nof capital ﬂows—physical ﬂows and portfolio ﬂows (which are further segmented\ninto equity markets and ﬁxed-income markets).\nPhysical Flows\nPhysical ﬂows encompass actual foreign direct investments by corporations such as\ninvestments in real estate, manufacturing, and local acquisitions. All of these require\nthat a foreign corporation sell its local currency and buy the foreign currency, which\nleads to movements in the FX market. This is particularly important for global\nmergers and corporate acquisitions that involve more cash than stock.\nPhysical ﬂows are important to watch, as they represent the underlying changes\nin actual physical investment activity. These ﬂows shift in response to changes in\neach country’s ﬁnancial health and growth opportunities. Changes in local laws that\nencourage foreign investment also serve to promote physical ﬂows. For example,\ndue to China’s entry into the WTO, its foreign investment laws have been relaxed.\nAs a result of China’s cheap labor and attractive revenue opportunities (population\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?34of over 1 billion), corporations globally have ﬂooded China with investments. From\nan FX perspective, in order to fund investments in China, foreign corporations need\nto sell their local currency and buy Chinese renminbi (RMB).\nPortfolio Flows in Equity Markets\nAs technology has enabled greater ease with respect to transportation of capital,\ninvesting in global equity markets has become far more feasible. Accordingly, a\nrallying stock market in any part of the world serves as an ideal opportunity for all,\nregardless of geographic location. The result of this has become a strong correlation\nbetween a country’s equity markets and its currency: If the equity market is rising,\ninvestment dollars generally come in to seize the opportunity. Alternatively, falling\nequity markets could prompt domestic investors to sell their shares of local publicly\ntraded ﬁrms to take advantage of investment opportunities abroad.\nThe attraction of equity markets over ﬁxed-income markets has increased across\nthe years. Since the early 1990s, the ratio of foreign transactions in U.S. government\nbonds over U.S. equities has declined from 10 to 1 to 2 to 1. As indicated in\nFigure 3.1, it is evident that the Dow had a high correlation (of approximately 81%)\nwith the U.S. dollar (against the EUR) between 1994 and 1999. In addition, from\n1991–1999, the Dow increased 300%, while the USD index appreciated nearly 30%\nfor the same time period. As a result, currency traders closely followed the global\nequity markets to predict short and intermediate term equity-based capital ﬂows.\nHowever, this relationship shifted after the tech bubble burst in the United States as\n1/31/9412500 1. 15\n1. 10\n1 .05\n1 .00\n0.95\n0.90\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n0.70\n0.6511500\n10500\n9500\n8500\n7500\n6500\n5500\n4500\n3500\n6/30/94 11/30/94 4/28/95 9/29/95 2/29/96 7/31/96 12/31/96Dow Jones and USDEUR\n5/30/97 10/31/97 3/31/98 8/31/98 1/29/99 6/30/99 11/30/99INDU Index Px Last USDEUR Curncy\nFIGURE 3.1 Dow and USDEUR\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?35foreign investors remained relatively risk averse causing a lower correlation between\nthe performance of the U.S. equity market and the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, a\nrelationship still exists, making it important for all traders to keep an eye on global\nmarket performances in search of intermarket opportunities.\nPortfolio Flows in Fixed-Income Markets\nJust as the equity market is correlated to exchange rate movement, so too is the\nﬁxed-income market. In times of global uncertainty, ﬁxed-income investments can\nbecome particularly appealing, due to the inherent safety they possess. As a result,\neconomies boasting the most valuable ﬁxed-income opportunities will be capable of\nattracting foreign investment—which will naturally ﬁrst require the purchasing of\nthe country’s respective currency.\nA good gauge of ﬁxed-income capital ﬂows are the short- and long-term yields of\ninternational government bonds. It is important to monitor the spread differential\nbetween the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the yield on foreign bonds because\ninternational investors tend to move money from one country to another in search\nof the highest yielding assets. When U.S. assets have one of the highest yields,\nthis encourages more investments in U.S. ﬁnancial instruments, hence beneﬁting\nthe U.S. dollar. When the United States has the lowest yields, this discourages\ninvestments. Investors can also use short-term yields, such as the spreads on 2-year\ngovernment bonds, to gauge the short-term ﬂow of international funds. Aside from\ngovernment bond yields, Fed fund futures can also be used to estimate movement\nof U.S. funds, as they price in the expectation of future Fed interest rate policy.\nEuribor futures are a barometer for the Euro region’s expected future interest rates\nand can give an indication of EU future policy movements. We will discuss how to\nuse ﬁxed-income products to trade FX further in our strategy section.\nTrade Flows: Measuring Exports versus Imports\nTrade ﬂows are the basis of all international transactions. Just as the investment\nenvironment of a given economy is a key driver of its currency valuation, trade ﬂows\nrepresent a country’s net trade balance. Countries that are net exporters—meaning\nthey sell more goods abroad than they buy—will experience a net trade surplus.\nCountries that are net exporters are more likely to have their currency rise in value\nbecause from the perspective of international trade, their currency is being bought\nmore than it is sold. This impacts currency ﬂows because international clients buying\nthe exported product/service must ﬁrst buy the currency of the exporting nation.\nCountries who are net importers purchase more goods abroad than they sell,\ncreating a trade deﬁcit. These nations will generally see more downward than\nupward pressure on their currencies because in order to purchase these foreign\ngoods, importers must sell their own currency and purchase the currency of the\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?36country from which they are buying the good or service. This accordingly drives\ndown the value of the currency when all else is equal. This concept is important\nbecause it is one of primary reasons why many economists say that certain currencies\nneed to fall to reverse burgeoning trade deﬁcits.\nTo understand this further, let’s imagine that the UK economy is booming,\nand its stock market is performing well. Meanwhile, in the United States, a\nlackluster economy is creating a shortage of investment opportunities. In this type\nof environment U.S. investors will feel more inclined to sell their U.S. dollars and\nbuy British pounds to participate in the outperformance of the UK economy. When\nthey elect to do so, it results in the outﬂow of capital from the United States and\nthe inﬂow of capital into the United Kingdom. From an exchange rate perspective,\nthis would induce a fall in the USD coupled with a rise in the GBP, as demand for\nUSD declines and the demand for GBP increases, translating into strength for the\nGBP/USD currency pair.\nEven day and swing traders will ﬁnd it valuable to keep up with incoming\neconomic reports from the major economies.\nTrading Tip: Charting Economic Surprises\nOne way for traders to stay on top of economic trends is to chart economic data\nsurprises against price action. Figure 3.2 illustrates how this can be done. The chart\ngraphs how much an economic indicator has deviated from its consensus forecast,\nor the ‘‘surprise,’’ and stacks them on the same side and graphs price (blue line)\naction when the data was release against the surprise, with a simple regression line\n(white line). This can be done for all of the major currency pairs and provides a\nvisual guide to understanding whether price action has been in line with economic\nfundamentals and can be used as a guide to future price action. Economic data can\nbe found on the calendars of any major forex website, and price action can generally\nbe downloaded from your trading platforms.\nAccording to Figure 3.2, in November of 2004, there were 14 out of 15 positive\neconomic surprises and yet the dollar sold off against the euro during the month\nof December, which was the month in which the economic data were released.\nAlthough this methodology is not exact, the analysis is simple and past charts\nhave yielded some extremely useful clues to future price action. Figure 3.3 shows\nhow the EURUSD moved the following month. As you can see, the EURUSD\nquickly corrected itself during the month of January, indicating that the fundamental\ndivergence from price action that occurred in December proved to be quite useful\nto dollar longs, which harvested almost 600 pips as the euro quickly retracted a large\npart of its gains in January. This method of analysis, called variant perception, was ﬁrst\ninvented by the legendary hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, who produced\n24% average rates return for 30 consecutive years.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?37US Dollar Data and EURUSD\n1 .3700\n1 .3600\n1 .3500\n1 .3400\n1 .3300\n1 .3200\n1. 3 10 0\n1 .3000\n–100%–26.11%0.00%0.00%1.41%1.46%2.56%2.81%3.55%4.18%14.29%16.67%33.33%43.48%50.25%140.00%\n–50% 0% 50%Durable Goods\nEmpire State Manufacturing\nPhilly Fed\nLeading Economic Indicators\nPersonal Income\nIndustrial Production\nISM Non-Manufacturing\nCurrent Account\nExisting Home Sales\nGDP Annualized\nU.

Large positive and negative\nsurprises in economic data can often yield clues to future price action. If you go back\nand look at the EURUSD charts, you will see that the record current account deﬁcits\nin October 2004 were the catalyst that sent the dollar plunging over the next two\nmonths. In many ways, economic fundamentals matter more in the foreign exchange\nmarket than in any other market, and charts such as these could provide valuable\nclues to price direction. Generally, the 15 most important economic indices are\nchosen from each region, and then a price regression line is superimposed over the\npast 20 days of price data.\n■Technical Analysis\nPrior to the mid-1980s, fundamental traders dominated the FX market. However,\nwith the rising popularity of technical analysis and the advent of new technologies,\nthe inﬂuence of technical trading on the FX market has increased signiﬁcantly. The\navailability of high leverage also led to an increased number of high frequency and\nmomentum. They have become active participants in the FX market, with the acute\nability to inﬂuence currency prices.\nUnlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses on the study of price\nmovements. Technical analysts use historical currency data to forecast the direction\nof future prices. The underlying belief behind technical analysis is that all current\nmarket information is already reﬂected in the price of that currency; therefore,\nstudying price action is all that is required to make informed trading decisions. In a\nnutshell, technical analysis assumes that history will repeat itself.\nTechnical analysis is an extremely popular tool used by short- and medium-term\ntraders for analyzing the forex market. It works especially well in the currency\nmarkets because short-term currency price ﬂuctuations are primarily driven by\nhuman emotions or market perceptions. The primary tool in technical analysis\nis price and charts. Traders will look for trends and patterns to identify trading\nopportunities. The most basic concept of technical analysis is that markets have a\ntendency to trend. Being able to identify trends in their earliest stage of development\nis the key to technical analysis. Range trading is also very popular, and similar tools\ncan be used to identify these setups. Technical analysis integrates price action and\nmomentum to construct a pictorial representation of past currency price action and\nto use this information to predict future performance. Technical analysis tools such\nas Fibonacci retracement levels, moving averages, oscillators, candlestick charts, and\nBollinger bands provide further information on the value of the emotional extremes\nof buyers and sellers. It also helps to gauge when greed and fear are the strongest.\nThere are basically two types of markets, trending or range bound, and in the trade\nparameters section, we outline some rules that can help traders determine the type\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?39of market they trading in right now and the sort of trading opportunities they should\nbe looking for.\nIs Technical Analysis or Fundamental Analysis Better?\nNo one will ever win the age-long battle between technical and fundamental analysis.\nHowever, most individual traders will start trading with technical analysis because\nit is easier to understand and does not require hours of study. Technical analysts can\nalso follow many currencies and markets at one time, whereas fundamental analysts\ntend to focus on a few pairs due to the overwhelming amount of data in the market.\nNonetheless, technical analysis works well because the currency market tends to\ndevelop strong trends. Once technical analysis is mastered, it can be applied with\nequal ease to any time frame or currency traded.\nHowever, it is important to take both strategies into consideration, as fundamental\nanalysis can trigger technical movements such as breakouts or reversal in trends.\nTechnical analysis, on the other hand, can also explain moves that fundamentals\ncannot, especially in quiet markets, causing resistance in trends or unexplainable\nmovements. For example, as shown in Figure 3.4, in the days leading up to\nSeptember 11, USDJPY had just broken out of a triangle formation and looked\npoised to head higher. However, as the chart indicates, instead of breaking higher as\ntechnicians may have anticipated, USDJPY broke down following the September 11,\n2001, terrorist attacks and ended up hitting a low of 115.81 from a high of 121.88\non September 10.\n■Currency Forecasting—What Bookworms\nand Economists Look At\nFor more avid students of foreign exchange who want to learn more about\nfundamental analysis and valuing currencies, this section examines the different\nmodels of currency forecasting used by analysts of the major investment banks.\nThere are seven major models for forecasting currencies, which include the balance\nof payments theory, purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, the monetary\nmodel, the real interest rate differential model, the asset market model, and the\ncurrency substitution model.\nBalance of Payments Theory\nThe balance of payments theory states that exchange rates should be at their\nequilibrium level, which is the rate that produces a stable current account balance.\nCountries with trade deﬁcits experience a run on their foreign exchange reserves\ndue to the fact that exporters to that nation must sell that nation’s currency in order\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?k\nk40k\nk\nFIGURE 3.4 USDJPY September 11th Chart\nSource: eSignal\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?41to receive payment. The cheaper currency makes the nation’s exports less expensive\nabroad, which in turn fuels exports and brings the currency into balance.\nWhat Is the Balance of Payments (BOP)?\nThe balance of payments account is divided into two parts: the current account and\nthe capital account. The current account measures trade in tangible, visible items\nsuch as cars and manufactured goods; the trade balance is the surplus or deﬁcit\nbetween exports and imports. The capital account measures ﬂows of money, such\nas investments for stocks or bonds. Balance of payments data can be found on the\nwebsite of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nTrade Flows\nThe trade balance of a country shows the net difference over a period of time\nbetween a nation’s exports and imports. When a country imports more than it\nexports, the trade balance is negative or is in a deﬁcit. If the country exports more\nthan it imports, the trade balance is positive or is in a surplus. The trade balance\nreﬂects the redistribution of wealth among countries and is a major channel through\nwhich the macroeconomic policies of a country may affect another.\nIn general, if a country has a trade deﬁcit, it is considered to be unfavorable, since\nit negatively impacts the value of the nation’s currency. For example, if U.S. trade\nﬁgures show greater imports than exports, more dollars ﬂow out of the United\nStates and the value of the U.S. currency depreciates. A positive trade balance,\nin comparison, will affect the dollar by causing it to appreciate against the other\ncurrencies.\nCapital Flows\nIn addition to trade ﬂows, there are also capital ﬂows that occur among countries.\nThey record a nation’s incoming and outgoing investment ﬂows, such as payments\nfor entire or parts of companies, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, real estate, and\nfactories. Capital ﬂows are inﬂuenced by many factors, including the ﬁnancial and\neconomic climate of other countries, and can be in the form of physical or portfolio\ninvestments. In general, in developing countries, the composition of capital ﬂows\ntends to be skewed toward foreign direct investment (FDI) and bank loans. For\ndeveloped countries, due to the strength of the equity and ﬁxed-income markets,\nstocks and bonds appear to be more important than bank loans and FDI.\nEquity Markets\nEquity markets have a signiﬁcant impact on exchange rate movements because\nthey are a major place for high-volume currency movements. Their importance is\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?42considerable for the currencies of countries with developed capital markets, where\na great amount of capital inﬂows and outﬂows occur, and where foreign investors\nare major participants. The amount of the foreign investment ﬂows in the equity\nmarkets is dependent on the general health and growth of the market, reﬂecting\nthe well-being of companies and particular sectors. Movements of currencies occur\nwhen foreign investors move their money to a particular equity market. Thus,\nthey convert their capital in a domestic currency and push the demand for it\nhigher, making the currency appreciate. When the equity markets are experiencing\nrecessions, however, foreign investors tend to ﬂee, thus converting back to their\nhome currency and pushing the domestic currency down.\nFixed-Income (Bond) Markets\nThe effect that ﬁxed-income markets have on currencies is similar to that of the\nequity markets and is a result of capital movements. An investor’s interest in the\nﬁxed-income market depends on the company’s speciﬁcs and credit rating, as well as\non the general health of the economy and the country’s interest rates. The movement\nof foreign capital into and out of ﬁxed-income markets leads to change in the demand\nand supply for currencies, hence impacting the currencies’ exchange rates.\nSummary of Trade and Capital Flows\nDetermining and understanding a country’s balance of payments is perhaps the\nmost important and useful tool for those interested in fundamental analysis. Any\ninternational transaction gives rise to two offsetting entries: trade ﬂow balance\n(current account) and capital ﬂow balance (capital account). If the trade ﬂow balance\nis a negative outﬂow, the country is buying more from foreigners than it sells\n(imports exceed exports). When it is a positive inﬂow, the country is selling more\nthan it buys (exports exceed imports). The capital ﬂow balance is positive when\nforeign inﬂows of physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed that\ncountry’s outﬂows. A capital ﬂow is negative when a country buys more physical or\nportfolio investments than are sold to foreign investors.\nThese two entries, trade and capital ﬂow, when added together signify a country’s\nbalance of payments. In theory, the two entries should balance and add up to zero\nin order to provide for the maintenance of the status quo in a nation’s economy and\ncurrency rates.\nIn general, countries might experience positive or negative trade, as well as\npositive or negative capital ﬂow balances. In order to minimize the net effect of\nthe two on the exchange rates, a country should try to maintain a balance between\nthe two. For example, in the United States, there is a substantial trade deﬁcit, as\nmore is imported than is exported. When the trade balance is negative, the country\nis buying more from foreigners than it sells, and therefore it needs to ﬁnance its\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?43deﬁcit. This negative trade ﬂow might be offset by a positive capital ﬂow into the\ncountry, as foreigners buy either physical or portfolio investments. Therefore, the\nUnited States seeks to minimize its trade deﬁcit and maximize its capital inﬂows,\nwith hopes that the two will balance out.\nA change in this balance is extremely signiﬁcant and carries ramiﬁcations that\nrun deep into economic policy and currency exchange levels. The net result of the\ndifference between the trade and capital ﬂows, positive or negative, will impact the\ndirection in which the nation’s currency will move. If the overall trade and capital\nbalance is negative, it will result in a depreciation of the nation’s currency, and if\npositive, it will lead to an appreciation of the currency.\nClearly, a change in the balance of payments carries a direct effect for currency\nlevels. It is therefore possible for any investor to observe economic data relating to\nthis balance and interpret the results that will occur. Data relating to capital and\ntrade ﬂows should be followed most closely. For instance, if an analyst observes\nan increase in the U.S. trade deﬁcit and a decrease in the capital ﬂows, a balance\nof payments deﬁcit would occur, and as a result, an investor may anticipate a\ndepreciation of the dollar.\nLimitations of BOP Model\nThe BOP model mainly focuses on traded goods and services, while ignoring\ninternational capital ﬂows. Indeed, international capital ﬂows often dwarfed trade\nﬂows in the currency markets toward the end of the 1990s, and this oftentimes\nbalanced out the current account of debtor nations like the United States.\nFor example, in 1999, 2000, and 2001, the United States maintained a large\ncurrent account deﬁcit while the Japanese ran a large current account surplus.\nHowever, during this same period in time the U.S. dollar rose against the yen even\nthough trade ﬂows were running against the dollar. The reason was that capital ﬂows\nbalanced out trade ﬂows, thus defying the BOP’s forecasting model for a period of\ntime. Indeed, the increase in capital ﬂows has given rise to the asset market model .\nNote: It is probably a misnomer to call this theory the balance of payments theory\nsince it only takes into account the current account balance, not the actual balance\nof payments. However, until the 1990s capital ﬂows played a very small role in the\nworld economy, so the main statistic viewed was the trade balance, which made up\nthe bulk of the balance of payments for most nations.\nPurchasing Power Parity\nThepurchasing power parity (PPP) theory is based on the belief that foreign exchange\nrates should be determined by the relative prices of a similar basket of goods between\ntwo countries. Any change in a nation’s inﬂation rate should be balanced by an\nopposite change in that nation’s exchange rate. Therefore, according to this theory,\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?44when a country’s prices are rising due to inﬂation, that country’s exchange rate\nshould depreciate in order to return to parity.\nPPP’s Basket of Goods\nThe basket of goods and services priced for the PPP exercise is a sample of all goods\nand services covered by GDP. It includes consumer goods and services, government\nservices, equipment goods, and construction projects. More speciﬁcally, consumer\nitems include food, beverages, tobacco, clothing, footwear, rents, water supply,\ngas, electricity, medical goods and services, furniture and furnishings, household\nappliances, personal transport equipment, fuel, transport services, recreational\nequipment, recreational and cultural services, telephone services, education services,\ngoods and services for personal care and household operation, and repair and\nmaintenance services.\nBig Mac Index\nOne of the most well-known examples of PPP is The Economist ’s Big Mac Index. The\nBig Mac PPP calculates the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the\nsame in America as elsewhere. Comparing these with actual rates helps to signal if\na currency is under- or overvalued. As described by The Economist, the index is a\nlightheartedly guide to currency valuation. It was never intended as a precise gauge\nof currency misalignment, but merely a tool to make exchange-rate theory more\ndigestible.\nFor example, in January 2015, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and\nChinese yuan was approximately 6.20. At the time, a Big Mac cost $4.79 in the\nUnited States. In China, the same burger cost 17.15 yuan, or approximately $2.77\nat market exchange. This means that based on the comparison between the two\nburger prices, the Chinese yuan was undervalued by 42%.\nOECD Purchasing Power Parity Index\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) releases a\nmore formal index. Under a joint OECD-Eurostat PPP Program, the OECD and\nEurostat share the responsibility for calculating PPPs. Their latest information on\nwhich currencies are under- or overvalued against the U.S. dollar can be found\non the OECD website at www.oecd.org. The OECD publishes a table that shows\nthe price levels for the major industrialized countries. Each column shows the\nnumber of speciﬁed monetary units needed in each of the countries listed to buy\nthe same representative basket of consumer goods and services. In each case,\nthe representative basket costs a hundred units in the country whose currency is\nspeciﬁed. The chart that is then created compares the PPP of a currency with its\nactual exchange rate. The chart is updated weekly to reﬂect the current exchange\nrate. It is also updated about twice a year to reﬂect new estimates of PPP. The\nPPP estimates are taken from studies carried out by the OECD; however, it should\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?45not be taken as deﬁnitive. Different methods of calculation will arrive at different\nPPP rates.\nAccording to the OECD’s data as of April 17, 2015, the PPP value of the\nAustralian dollar versus the U.S. dollar based on GDP is 0.6712. At the time, the\nAUD/USD exchange rate was 0.7812. Using this model of valuation, this indicates\nthat the Australian dollar was 14% overvalued.\nLimitations to Using Purchasing Power Parity\nPPP theory should only be used for long-term fundamental analysis. While the\neconomic forces behind PPP will eventually equalize the purchasing power of\ncurrencies, this can take many years. A time horizon of 5–10 years is typical.\nPPP’s major weakness is that it assumes goods can be traded easily, without regard\nto such things as tariffs, quotas, or taxes. For example, when the U.S. government\nannounces new tariffs on imported steel, the cost of domestic manufactured goods\ngoes up; but those increases will not be reﬂected in the U.S. PPP tables.\nThere are other factors that must also be considered when weighing PPP: inﬂation,\ninterest rate differentials, economic releases/reports, asset markets, trade ﬂows,\nand political developments. Indeed, PPP is just one of several theories traders should\nuse when determining exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Parity\nThe interest rate parity theory states that if two different currencies have different\ninterest rates, then that difference should be reﬂected in the premium or discount\nfor the forward exchange rate to prevent riskless arbitrage.\nFor example, if U.S. interest rates are 3% and Japanese interest rates are 1%,\nthen the U.S. dollar should depreciate against the Japanese yen by 2% in order\nto prevent riskless arbitrage. This future exchange rate is reﬂected in the forward\nexchange rate stated today. In our example, the forward exchange rate of the dollar\nis said to be at discount because it buys fewer Japanese yen in the forward rate than\nit does in the spot rate. The yen is said to be at a premium.\nInterest rate parity has shown very little proof of effectiveness in recent years.\nOftentimes, currencies with higher interest rates rise and attract incoming invest-\nment, while currencies with low and falling interest rates decline as outﬂows slow.\nThe Monetary Model\nAccording to the monetary model, exchange rates are determined by a nation’s\nmonetary policy. The premise is that countries that follow a stable monetary policy\nover time should have appreciating currencies. Countries that have erratic monetary\npolicies or excessively expansionist policies should see the value of their currency\ndepreciate.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?46How to Use the Monetary Model\nThree factors inﬂuence exchange rates under this theory:\n1. A nation’s money supply\n2. Expected future levels of a nation’s money supply\n3. The growth rate of a nation’s money supply\nAll of these factors are key to understanding and spotting a monetary trend that\nmay force a change in exchange rates. For example, let’s assume that the Japanese\neconomy has been slipping in and out of recession for over a decade. Interest rates\nare near zero and annual budget deﬁcits prevent the Japanese from spending their\nway out of recession, which leaves only one tool left at the disposal of Japanese\nofﬁcials determined to revive Japan’s economy: printing more money. By buying\nstocks and bonds, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is increasing the nation’s money supply,\nwhich produces inﬂation, and this forces a change in the exchange rate. The example\nin Figure 3.5 illustrates the effect of money supply changes to the Japanese yen using\nthe monetary model.\nIndeed, it is in the area of excessive expansionary monetary policy that the\nmonetary model is most successful. One of the only ways a country can keep\nits currency from sharply devaluing is by pursuing a tight monetary policy. For\nexample, during the Asian Currency Crisis, the Hong Kong dollar came under\nattack from speculators. Hong Kong ofﬁcials raised interest rates to 300% to halt\nthe Hong Kong dollar from being dislodged from its peg to the U.S. dollar. The\ntactic worked perfectly, as speculators were cleared out by such sky-high interest\nrates. The downside was that the Hong Kong economy would slide into recession.\nBut in the end, the peg held and the monetary model worked.\nLimitations of the Monetary Model\nVery few economists rely solely on this model because it does not take into account\ntrade ﬂows and capital ﬂows. For example, throughout 2014 Australia had higher\ninterest rates, growth rates, and inﬂation rates than both the United States and the\nEuropean Union, yet, the AUD appreciated in value against both the dollar and the\neuro. Indeed, the monetary model has greatly struggled since the dawn of freely\nCHANGE IN MONEY\nSUPPL Y\nY en Is Printed Increase in Y en Creates\nInflationY en Depreciates in ValueCHANGE IN EXCHANGE\nRATECHANGE IN PRICE\nLEVEL\nFIGURE 3.5 Monetary Model\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?47ﬂoating currencies. The model holds that high interest rates signal growing inﬂation,\nwhich it often does, followed by a depreciating currency. But this does not take into\naccount the capital inﬂows that would take effect as a result of higher interest yields\nor of an equity market that may be thriving in a booming economy—thus causing\nthe currency to possibly appreciate.\nIn any case, the monetary model is one of several valuation tools that can be\nemployed in tandem with other models to determine the direction an exchange rate\nis heading.\nReal Interest Rate Differential Model\nAccording to the real interest rate differential theory, exchange rate movements are\ndetermined by a country’s interest rate. The idea is that countries with high interest\nrates should see their currency appreciate in value, while countries with low interest\nrates should see their currency depreciate in value.\nBasics of the Model\nThe basic premise of the model is that when a country raises its interest rates,\ninternational investors will buy that currency because they ﬁnd its yield more\nattractive. When a country lowers interest rates, they sell the currency. Figure 3.6\nUK\nUKInterest Rates vs. United States Eurozone\nEurozone2003 Percent.

The Australian dollar had the\nlargest basis point spread and also had the highest return against the U.S. dollar,\nwhich seems to vindicate the model, as investors bought up higher-yielding Aussie.\nThe same can be said for the New Zealand dollar, which also had a higher yield\nthan the U.S. dollar and gained 27% against USD. Yet the model becomes less\nconvincing when comparing the euro, which gained 20% against the dollar (more\nthan every currency except NZD), even though its basis point differential was\nonly 100 points. The model then comes under serious question when comparing\nthe British pound and the Japanese yen. The yen differential is –100, and yet it\nappreciated almost 12% against the dollar. Meanwhile, the British pound gained\nonly 11% against the dollar even though it had a whopping 275 point interest rate\ndifferential.\nThis model also stresses that one of the key factors in determining the severity of\nan exchange rate’s response to a shift in interest rates is the expected persistence of\nthat shift. Simply put, a rise in interest rates that is expected to last for ﬁve years\nwill have a much larger impact on the exchange rate than if that rise were expected\nto last for only one year.\nLimitations to the Interest Rate Model\nThere is a great deal of debate among international economists over whether there\nis a strong and statistically signiﬁcant link between changes in a nation’s interest rate\nand currency price. The main weakness of this model is that it does not take into\naccount a nation’s current account balance, relying on capital ﬂows instead. Indeed,\nthe model tends to overemphasize capital ﬂows at the expense of numerous other\nfactors, such as political stability, inﬂation, and poor economic growth. Absent these\ntypes of factors, the model can be very useful, since it is quite logical to conclude\nthat an investor will naturally gravitate toward the investment vehicle that pays a\nhigher reward.\nThe Asset Market Model\nThe basic premise of the asset market model theory is that the ﬂow of funds into the\nﬁnancial assets of a country such as equities and bonds increases the demand for that\ncountry’s currency (and vice versa). As proof, advocates point out that the amount\nof funds that are placed in investment products such as stocks and bonds now dwarf\nthe amount of funds that is exchanged as a result of the transactions in goods and\nservices for import and export purposes. The asset market theory is basically the\nopposite of the balance of payments theory since it takes into account a nation’s\ncapital account instead of its current account.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?49A Dollar-Driven Theory\nThroughout 1999, many experts argued that the dollar would fall against the euro\non the grounds of the expanding U.S. current account deﬁcit and an overvalued\nWall Street. That was based on the rationale that non-U.S. investors would begin\nwithdrawing their funds from U.S. stocks and bonds into more economically sound\nmarkets, which would weigh signiﬁcantly on the dollar. Yet, such fears have lingered\nsince the early 1980s when the U.S. current account soared to a record high 3.5%\nof GDP.\nIn the two decades that followed, the balance of payments approach in assessing\nthe dollar’s behavior has given way to the asset market approach. This theory\ncontinues to hold the most sway over pundits due to the enormity of U.S. capital\nmarkets. In May and June of 2002, the dollar plummeted over 1000 points versus\nthe yen at the same time equity investors ﬂed U.S. equity markets due to the\naccounting scandals that were plaguing Wall Street. As the scandals subsided toward\nthe end of 2002, the dollar rose 500 points from a low of 115.43 to close at 120.00\nagainst the yen, even though the current account balance remained in massive deﬁcit\nthe entire time.\nLimitations to the Asset Market Theory\nIt is frequently argued that over the long run, there is no relationship between\na nation’s equity market performance and the performance of its currency. See\nFigure 3.7 for a comparison. Between April 2014 and April 2015, the German DAX\nand EURUSD have a very weak correlation.\nAlso, what happens to a nation’s currency when the stock market is trading\nsideways—stuck between bullish and bearish sentiments? That was the scenario in\n6/11/14 7/11/14 8/11/14 9/11/1410/11/14 11/11/14 12/11/141/11/15 2/11/15 3/11/15 4/11/15 5/11/15 6/11/15EURUSD and DAX\n13000\n12500\n12000\n11500\n11000\n10500\n10000\n9500\n9000\n80001.4\n1.35\n1.3\n1.2\n11.051.11.151.25\n8500\nEURUSD BGN Curncy (R1) DAX  INDEX (R2)\nFIGURE 3.7 The DAX Index and the EURUSD\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?50Germany for much of 2014, and currency traders found themselves going back to\nolder money making models, such as interest rate arbitrage, as a result. Only time\nwill tell whether the asset market model will hold up or merely be a short-term blip\non the currency forecasting radar.\nThe Currency Substitution Model\nThe currency substitution model is an enhanced version of the monetary model\nbecause it takes into account investor ﬂows. It posits that the shifting of private\nand public portfolios from one nation to another can have a signiﬁcant effect on\nexchange rates. The ability of individuals to change their assets from domestic and\nforeign currencies is known as currency substitution. When this model is added\nto the monetary model, evidence shows that shifts in expectations of a nation’s\nmoney supply can have a decided impact on that nation’s exchange rates. Simply\nput, investors are looking at monetary model data and coming to the conclusion\nthat a change in money ﬂow is about to occur, thus affecting the exchange rate, so\nthey are investing accordingly, which turns the monetary model into a self-fulﬁlling\nprophecy. Investors who subscribe to this theory are merely jumping on the currency\nsubstitution model bandwagon on the way to the monetary model party.\nThe Yen Example\nIn the monetary model we talked about how the Japanese government was basically\nprinting yen and increasing the money supply when it bought stocks and bonds.\nMonetary model theorists would say that this monetary growth would spark inﬂation\n(more yen chasing fewer products), decrease demand for the yen, and ﬁnally cause\nthe yen to depreciate. A currency substitution theorist would agree with this scenario\nand look to take advantage of this view by shorting the yen, or if they were long\nthe yen promptly getting out of the position. By taking this action, our yen trader\nis helping to drive the market precisely in that direction, thus making the monetary\nmodel theory a fate accompli. The step-by-step process is illustrated in Figure 3.8.\nA. Japan announces new stock and bond buyback plan. Economists are now\npredicting Japan’s money supply will dramatically increase.\nB. Economists are also predicting a rise in inﬂation with the introduction of this\nnew policy. Speculators expect a change in the exchange rate as a result.\nC. Economists expect interest rates to rise and inﬂation takes hold in the economy.\nSpeculators start selling short the yen in anticipation of a change in the exchange\nrate.\nD. Demand for the yen plummets as money ﬂows easily through the Japanese\neconomy and speculators dump yen in the markets.\nE. The exchange rate for the Japanese yen changes dramatically as the yen falls\nin value to foreign currencies, especially those that are easily substituted by\ninvestors (read: liquid yen crosses).\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?51Forecast of\nFuture\nMonetary\nGrowth Forecast of\nFuture InflationChange in\nExchange RateChange in Real\nMoney Demand\nChange in\nExpected\nExchange RateChange in\nDemand for\nForeign Cash\nAB CD EForecast of\nFuture Inflation\nFIGURE 3.8 Currency Substitution Model\nLimitations of the Currency Substitution Model\nAmong the major, actively traded currencies, this model has not yet shown itself\nto be a convincing, single determinant for exchange rate movements. While this\ntheory can be used with more conﬁdence in underdeveloped countries where ‘‘hot\nmoney’’ rushes in and out of emerging markets with enormous effect, there are\nstill too many variables not accounted for by the currency substitution model. For\nexample, using the yen illustration in Figure 3.8, even though Japan may try to spark\ninﬂation with its securities’ buyback plan, it still has an enormous current account\nsurplus that will continually prop up the yen. Also, Japan has numerous political\nlandmines it must avoid in its own neighborhood, and should Japan make it clear\nthat it is trying to devalue its currency, there will be enormous repercussions. These\nare just two of many factors the substitution model does not take into consideration.\nHowever, this model (like numerous other currency models) should be considered\npart of an overall, balanced, FX forecasting diet."

This includes the following:\n1. What are the best times to trade for individual currency pairs?\n2. What are the most market moving economic data?\n3. What are currency correlations, and how can we use them?\n■What Are the Best Times to Trade for Individual\nCurrency Pairs?\nThe Foreign Exchange market operates 24 hours a day, making it nearly impossible\nfor a single trader to track every market movement and respond immediately at all\ntimes. Timing is everything in currency trading. In order to devise an effective and\ntime-efﬁcient investment strategy, it is important to understand how much liquidity\nthere is around the clock to maximize the number of trading opportunities during a\ntrader’s own market hours. Besides liquidity, a currency pair’s trading range is also\nheavily dependent on geographical location and macroeconomic factors. Knowing\nwhat time of day a currency pair has the widest or narrowest trading range will\nundoubtedly help traders improve their investment utility due to better capital\nallocation. This section outlines the typical trading activity of major currency pairs\nin different time zones to see when they are the most volatile.

During the Asian trading session, the largest volume is\ntransacted in Tokyo, followed by Hong Kong and Singapore. Trading in Tokyo can\nbe thin from time to time; but large investment banks and hedge funds are known to\ntry to use the Asian session to run important stop and option barrier levels, especially\nduring Sunday trade. Figure 4.2 provides a ranking of the different currency pairs\nand their ranges during the Asian trading session.\nMore risk-tolerant traders may choose to trade USDJPY, GBPCHF, and GBPJPY\nbecause their broad ranges provide short-term traders with lucrative proﬁt potentials,\nwith an average daily range of 90 pips. Foreign investment banks and institutional\ninvestors who hold mostly dollar-dominated assets also contribute to the daily ﬂow\nin USDJPY through their Japanese equity and bond markets transactions. The Bank\nof Japan, who holds over $1.2 trillion of U.S. Treasury debt, is an active player with\ntheir open market operations impacting the value of the currency. Last but not least,\nlarge Japanese exporters may choose to repatriate their foreign earnings during the\nTokyo trading session, adding to the ﬂuctuations of the currency pair.

When the U.S. equity and bond markets are open during\nthe U.S. session, foreign investors have to convert their domestic currency, such\nas the euro, Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc into dollar-dominated assets in order\nto carry out their transactions.

In AUDCAD for\nexample, for an Australian dollar to be converted into Canadian dollars, it usually\nhas to be traded against the USD ﬁrst, then CAD. This means an AUDCAD trade\ntypically involves two different currency transactions, AUDUSD and USDCAD,\nand its volatility is ultima tely determined by the correlations of the two derived\ncurrency pairs. Since AUDUSD and USDCAD are negatively correlated, which\nmeans they tend to move in opposite directions, the volatility of AUDCAD is\nampliﬁed. Trading currency pairs with high volatility can be very lucrative, but in\ndoing it is also important to bear in mind that the risk involved can also be high.\nTraders should continuously evaluate their strategies as market conditions change\nbecause big moves in exchange rates can easily nullify their long-term strategies.\nFor the more risk-averse traders, USDJPY, EURUSD, and USDCAD can be\nattractive pairs because they offer a dece nt trading range with lower risk. The highly\nliquid nature of these currency pairs can also allow investor to secure proﬁts or\ncut losses promptly and efﬁciently. The modest volatility of these pairs provides a\nfavorable environment for traders who want to pursue long-term strategies.\nEuropean Session (London): 3am to 12pm EST\nLondon is the largest and most important dealing center in the world, with a market\nshare of more than 40% according to the BIS survey.

While such high volatility\ncan create much in the way of opportunity, it is important to realize that the\npeak of daily trade activity in these two pairs generally happens during the London\nsession. With the London trading session overlapping both the New York and Tokyo\nsessions, it is the perfect market for banks and institutional investors to reposition\ntheir portfolios, and these adjustments contribute to the volatility in the market.\nTraders with moderate risk proﬁles will also ﬁnd plenty of pairs to choose from.\nEURUSD, USDCAD, GBPUSD, and USDCHF have an average range of 100 pips. As\nmentioned earlier, trading in these pairs is active because large market participants\nlike to adjust their portfolios before the U.S. session opens.\nFor the more risk-averse, the NZDUSD, AUDUSD, EURCHF, and AUDJPY,\nwith an average of 50 pips range, are good choices as these pairs provide traders with\nhigh interest income and proﬁt potential.

In many cases, foreign economic\nconditions, interest rates, and price changes affect much more than just a single\ncurrency pair. Everything is interrelated in the forex market to some extent and\nknowing the direction and how strong this relationship is can be an advantage; it\nhas the potential to be a great trading tool. The bottom line is that unless you only\nwant to trade one pair at a time, it can be very proﬁtable to take into account\nhow pairs move relative to one another. To do this, we use correlation analysis.\nCorrelations are calculations based on pricing data, and these numbers can help\ngauge the relationships that exist between different currency pairs. The information\nthat the numbers provide can be a good aid for any traders who want to diversify\ntheir portfolio, double up on positions without investing in the same currency pair,\nor just get an idea of how much risk their trades are opening them up to. If used\ncorrectly, this method has the potential to maximize gains, gauge exposure, and\nhelp prevent counterproductive trading.\nWHAT ARE CURRENCY CORRELATIONS, AND HOW CAN WE USE THEM?68■Positive/Negative Correlations—What They Mean\nand How to Use Them\nKnowing how closely correlated the currency pairs are in your portfolio is a great\nway to measure your exposure and risk. You might think that you’re diversifying\nyour portfolio by investing in different pairs, but many of them have a tendency to\nmove in the same or opposite dir ection from one another. The correlations between\npairs can be strong or weak and last for weeks, months, or even years. Basically,\nwhat a correlation number measures is an estimate of how often these pairs move\ntogether or how opposite their actions are over a speciﬁed period of time. Any\ncorrelation calculation will be in decimal form; the closer the number is to 1, the\nstronger the connection between the two cu rrencies. For example, by looking at\nthe sample data in Table 6.1, we can see a +0.94 correlation between the EURUSD\nand the NZDUSD over the last month. If you are not a fan of decimals, you can also\nthink of the number as a percentage by multiplying it by 100% (in this case, getting\na 94% correlation between the EURUSD and the NZDUSD). High decimals reﬂect\ncurrency pairs that closely mirror one another, while lower numbers tell us that the\npairs do not usually move in a parallel fashion. Therefore, because there is a high\ncorrelation in this particular pair, we can see that by investing in both the EURUSD\nand the NZDUSD at the same time, you are virtually doubling up on a position.\nLikewise, it might not be the best idea to go long one of the pairs and short the\nother because a rally in one has a high likelihood of also setting off a rally in the\nother currency pair. While this would not make your proﬁt and losses exactly zero\nbecause they have different pip values, the two do move in such a similar fashion\nthat taking opposing positions could take a bite out of proﬁts or even cause losses.\nPositive correlations aren’t the only way to measure similarities between pairings;\nnegative correlations can be just as useful. In this case, instead of a very positive\nnumber, we are looking for a highly negative one. The closer the number is to\n–1, the increasingly connected the two currencies movements are, but this time in\nthe opposite direction. Again, we can use the EURUSD as an example. While we\njust saw a strong positive correlation with the NZDUSD, the EURUSD has a very\nnegative relationship with the USDCHF. Between these two currency pairs, the\ncorrelation has been –0.98 over the last year and –0.99 over the past month. This\nnumber indicates that these two pairs have a strong propensity to move in opposite\ndirections. Therefore, buying both currency pairs at the same time will often lead\nto gains in one and losses in the other. Buying one pair and selling the other would\nbe an intensiﬁcation of risk that can be v iewed as doubling up on t he same or similar\nposition.\nWHAT ARE CURRENCY CORRELATIONS, AND HOW CAN WE USE THEM?69Important Fact about Correlations: They Change\nAnyone who has ever traded the FX market knows that currencies are very dynamic;\neconomic conditions, both sentiment and pricing, change every day. Because of this,\nthe most important aspect to remember when analyzing currency correlations is\nthat they can also change overtime. The str ong correlations that are calculated today\nmight not be the same this time next year, or even next month. Due to the constant\nreshaping of the forex environment, it is imperative to keep current if you decide\nto use this method for trading. For example, over a one-month period that we\nobserved, the correlation between USDCAD and USDJPY was 0.06. This is a very\nlow number and would indicate that the pairs do not really share any deﬁnitive trend\nin their movements. However, if we look at the three-month data for the same time\nperiod, the number increases to 0.12 and then to 0.59 for six months, and ﬁnally\nto 0.80 for a year. In this particular example, we can see that there was a recent\nbreakdown in the relationship between these two pairs. What was once a strongly\npositive association over time has deteriorated completely in the short term. On\nthe other hand, the correlation between USDCHF and AUDUSD strengthened in\nmore recent reports. The correlation between these two pairs started at –0.78 for\nthe year and edged up to –0.94 for the last month. This suggests that there is an\nincreasing probability that if one of the trades became proﬁtable, the other would as\nwell. The opposite is also true that if one of the trades incurs signiﬁcant losses, the\nother has a very high likelihood of also ending up unproﬁtable.\nAn even more dramatic example of the extent to which these numbers can change\ncan be found in the GBPUSD and AUDUSD pai rs; there was a –0.79 correlation\nbetween the two for the yearlong data. However, while these two tended to move\nin reasonably opposite directions in the long term, over the month of February\n2005, for example, they were positively correlated with a +0.76 reading. The\nmajor events that change the amount and even direction that pairs are correlated are\nusually associated with major economic developments, such as interest rate changes\nor quantitative easing.\nCalculating Correlations Yourself\nBecause correlations have the tendency to shift overtime and the data in the table\ncould be stale by the time you read it, the best way to keep current on the direction\nand strength of your pairings is to calculate them yourself. Although it might seem\nlike a tricky concept, the actual process can be made quite easy. The simplest way\nto calculate the numbers is to use Microsoft Excel. In Excel, you can take the\ncurrency pairs that you want to derive a correlation from over a speciﬁc time period\nWHAT ARE CURRENCY CORRELATIONS, AND HOW CAN WE USE THEM?70\nEURUSD AUDUSD USDJPY GBPUSD NZDUSD USDCHF USDCAD\n1 Month 0.94 −0.92 0.92 0.94 −0.99 −0.32\n3 Month 0.47 −0.37 0.83 0.57 −0.98 −0.61\n6 Month 0.74 −0.83 0.94 0.78 −0.96 −0.57\n1Y e a r 0 . 8 5 −0 86 0.91 0.93 −09 8 −0.89\nAUDUSD EURUSD USDJPY GBPUSD NZDUSD USDCHF USDCAD\n1 Month 0.94 −0.91 0.95 0.96 −09 4 −0.17\n3 Month 0.47 0.24 0.81 0.90 −04 4 −0.14\n6 Month 0.74 −0.70 0.75 0.89 −0.70 −0.54\n1Y e a r 0 . 8 5 −0.87 0.79 0.90 −0.78 −0.81\nUSDJPY EURUSD AUDUSD GBPUSD NZDUSD USDCHF USDCAD\n1 Month −0.92 −0.91 −0.88 −0.91 0.94 0.06\n3 Month −0.37 0.24 −0.08 0.15 0.40 0.12\n6 Month −0.83 −0.70 −0.75 −0.61 0.83 0.59\n1Y e a r −0.86 −0.87 −0.82 −0.84 0.83 0.80\nGBPUSD EURUSD AUDUSD USDJPY NZDUSD USDCHF USDCAD\n1 Month 0.92 0.95 −0.88 0.87 −0.95 −0.03\n3 Month 0.83 0.81 −0.08 0.83 −0.82 −0.36\n6 Month 0.94 0.75 −0.75 0.84 −0.88 −0.42\n1 Year 0.91 0.79 −0.82 0.82 −0.90 −0.70\nNZDUSD EURUSD AUDUSD USDJPY GBPUSD USDCHF USDCAD\n1 Month 0.94 0.96 −0.91 0.87 −0.92 −0.29\n3 Month 0.57 0.90 0.15 0.83 −0.53 −0.35\n6 Month 0.78 0.89 −0.61 0.84 −0.69 −0.38\n1 Year 0.93 0.90 −0.84 0.82 −0.88 −0.94\nUSDCHF EURUSD AUDUSD USDJPY GBPUSD NZDUSD USDCAD\n1 Month −0.99 −0.94 0.94 −0.95 −0.92 0.21\n3 Month −0.98 −04 4 0 . 4 0 −0.82 −0.53 0.55\n6 Month −0.96 −07 0 0 . 8 3 −0.88 −0.69 0.70\n1Y e a r −0.98 −07 8 0 . 8 3 −0.90 −0.88 0.87\nUSDCAD EURUSD AUDUSD USDJPY GBPUSD NZDUSD USDCHF\n1 Month −0.32 −0.17 0.06 −0.03 −0.29 0.21\n3 Month −0.61 −0.14 0.12 −0.36 −0.35 0.55\n6 Month −0.57 −0.54 0.59 −04 2 −0.38 0.70\n1Y e a r −0.89 −0.81 0.80 −07 0 −0.94 0.87\nDate EURUSD AUDUSD USDJPY GBPUSD NZDUSD USDCHF USDCAD\n03/29/2004 - 09/29/2004 6 Month Trailing 0.10 −0.28 0.69 0.68 −0.88 −0.60\n04/29/2004 - 10/28/2004 6 Month Trailing 0.77 −0.67 0.47 0.84 −0.90 −0.78\n05/31/2004 - 11/29/2004 6 Month Trailing 0.96 −0.88 0.61 0.88 −0.97 −0.89\n06/30/2004 - 12/29/2004 6 Month Trailing 0.93 −0.94 0.87 0.94 −0.98 −0.85\n07/30/2004 - 01/28/2005 6 Month Trailing 0.93 −0.93 0.92 0.95 −0.99 −0.86\n08/31/2004 - 03/01/2005 6 Month Trailing 0.88 −0.91 0.96 0.91 −0.98 −0.80\n09/30/2004 - 03/31/2005 6 Month Trailing 0.74 −0.83 0.95 0.79 −0.96 −0.58\nAverage 0.76 −0.78 0.78 0.86 −0.95 −0.77\nFIGURE 6.1 March Correlation Table\nWHAT ARE CURRENCY CORRELATIONS, AND HOW CAN WE USE THEM?71and just use the correlation function.

        "73CHAPTER 7\nTrade Parameters\nfor Various Market\nConditions\nAfter learning about the emergence of the foreign exchange market, who the\nmajor players are, signiﬁcant historical milestones, and what moves the markets,\nit is time to move on and discuss some of my favorite strategies for trading currencies.\nHowever, before I even begin going over these strategies, the most important ﬁrst\nstep for any trader, regardless of the market that you are trading in, is to create a\ntrading journal.\n■Keep a Trading Journal\nThrough my experience, I have learned that being a successful trader is not about\nﬁnding the holy grail of indicators that can perfectly forecast movements 100% of\nthe time, but instead, to develop discipline. I cannot undermine the importance of\n‘‘the journal’’ as the primary ﬁrst step to becoming a successful and professional\ntrader. While working on the Inter-bank FX trading desk at J.P. Morgan and then\non the Cross-Markets trading desk after the merger with Chase, the trading journal\nmentality was engrained into the minds of every dealer and proprietary trader on the\ntrading ﬂoors, regardless of rank. The reason was simple—the bank was providing\nthe capital for trading and we needed to be held accountable, especially since each\ntransaction involved millions of dollars. For every trade that was executed, we\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS74needed to have a solid rationale as well as justiﬁcation for the choice of entry and exit\nlevels. More speciﬁcally, you had to know where to place your exit points before\nyou placed the trade to approximate worst case losses and to manage risk.\nWith this sort of accountability, the leading banks of the world are able to breed\nsuccessful and professional traders. For individual traders, this practice is even more\nimportant because you are trading with your own money and not someone else’s.\nBank traders are trading with someone else’s money so regardless of how poorly\nthey perform over a one- or two-week basis, they will receive their paycheck twice\na month. At a bank, traders have plenty of time to make the money back without any\ndisruptions to their daily way of life—unless of course they lose $1 million in one\nday. As an individual trader—you do not have this luxury. When you are trading\nwith your own money, each dollar lost is a dollar less that you own. So even though\nyou should only be trading with risk capital, or money that would not otherwise be\nused for rent or groceries, one way or the other, the pain is felt. To avoid repeating\nthe same mistakes and taking large losses, I cannot stress enough the importance of\nkeeping a trading journal. The journal is designed to ensure that as a trader, you\nonly take calculated losses and learn from each mistake. The trading journal setup\nthat I recommend should be broken up into three parts:\n1. Currency pair checklist\n2. Trades that I am waiting for\n3. Existing or completed trades\nCurrency Pair Checklist\nThe ﬁrst section of your trading journal should consist of a spreadsheet that can be\nprinted out and completed every day. This purpose of this checklist is to get a feel\nof the market and to identify trades. It should list of all of the currency pairs that are\noffered for trading on the left column, followed by three columns for the current,\nhigh, and low prices, and then a series of triggers laid out as a row on the right\nhand side. Newer traders should start with following only the four major currency\npairs, which are the EURUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, and the GBPUSD, and then\ngradually add the AUDUSD, USDCAD, and NZDUSD, followed by the nondollar\npairs. Although the checklist that I have created is fairly detailed, I ﬁnd that it is\na very useful daily exercise and should take no more than 20 minutes to complete\nonce the appropriate indicators are saved on the charts. The purpose of this checklist\nis to get a clear visual of which currencies are trending and which are range trading.\nComprehending the big picture is the ﬁrst step to trading successfully. Too often\nhave I seen traders fail because they lose sight of the overall environment that they\nare trading in. The worst thing to do is to trade blindly. Trying to pick tops or\nbottoms in a strong trend or buying breakouts in a range-bound environment can\nlead to signiﬁcant losses. Just take a look at Figure 7.1 of the EURUSD. If you tried\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS75\nFIGURE 7.1 EURUSD Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS76to pick bottoms in this pair, it would have led to an entire year of frustrating and\nunsuccessful trading. In trending environments, traders will ﬁnd a higher success\nrate by buying on retracements in an uptrend or selling on rallies in a downtrend.\nPicking tops and bottoms should only be a strategy that is used in clear range trading\nenvironments and even with that, traders need to be careful of contracting ranges\nthat can lead to breakout scenarios.\nA simpliﬁed version of the daily market overview sheet that I use is shown in\nFigure 7.2.\nAs you can see in Figure 7.2, the ﬁrst two columns after the daily high and low\nprices are the levels of the 10-day high or low. Recording this price helps to identify\nwhere current prices are within previous price action. This helps traders get a gauge\nof whether we are pressing toward a 10-day high or low or if we are simply trapped\nin the middle of the range. Yet the prices alone do not provide enough information\nto determine if we are in a trending or a range-bound environment. The next ﬁve\nindicators is a checklist for determining a trending environment. The more X marks\nin this section, the stronger the trend.\nThe ﬁrst column in the trending indicator group is the ‘‘ADX (14) above 25.’’\nADX is the Accumulation Distribution Index, which is the most popular used\nindicator for determining the strength of a trend. If the index reading is above 25,\nit indicates that a trend has developed. Generally speaking, the greater the number,\nthe stronger the trend. The next column is Bollinger Bands. When strong trends\ndevelop, the pair will frequently tag and cross either the upper or lower Bollinger\nBand. The next three trend indicators are the longer term moving averages. A\nbreak above or below these moving averages may also be indicative of a trending\nenvironment. With moving averages, crossovers in the direction of the trend can be\nused as a further conﬁrmation. If there are two or more Xs in this section, traders\nshould be looking for opportunities to buy on dips in an uptrend or sell on rallies in a\ndowntrend rather than selling at the top and buying back at the bottom of the range.\nThe last section of the trading journal is indications of range. The ﬁrst indicator is\nalso ADX, but this time, we are looking for ADX below 25, which signals that the\ncurrency pair’s trend is weak. Next, we look at the traditional oscillators, RSI and\nstochastics. If the ADX is weak and there is signiﬁcant technical resistance above,\nprovided by indicators such as moving averages or Fibonacci retracement levels,\nand RSI and/or stochastics are at overbought or oversold levels, we identify an\nenvironment that is highly conducive to range trading.\nOf course, the market overview sheet is not foolproof, and just because you have\na lot of X marks in either the trend or range group doesn’t mean that a trend will\nnot fade or a breakout will not occur. Yet, what this spreadsheet will do is prevent\ntraders from trading blindly and ignoring the broader market conditions. It provides\ntraders with a launching pad from which to identify the day’s trading opportunities.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS77Date - Time\nTrending Range\nCurrencyPair Current\nPriceDaily\nHighDaily\nLow10-day\nHigh10-day\nLowBollinger\nBand UpBollinger\nBand Down(14)\nabove 25Crosses\n50-DayCrosses\n100-dayCrosses\n200-dayBollinger\nBand\nRangeADX\n(14)\nbelow\n25RS1 (14)\nGreater\nthan 80(14)\nLess\nthan 80Stochastics\n>70Stochastics\n<30\nEURUSD 1.105 1.1144 1.0923 X X X X\nGBPUSD\nUSDJPY\nUSDCHF\nAUDUSD\nNZDUSD\nUSDCAD\nEURJPY\nEURGBP\nEURCHF\nAUDJPY\nCHFJPY\nGBPJPY\nGBPCHF\nAUDCAD\nEURCAD\nAUDNZD\nFIGURE 7.2 Currency Checklist\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS78Trades That I Am Waiting For\nThe next section in the trading journal lists out the possible trades for the day. Based\non an initial overview of the charts, this section is where you should list the trades\nfor which you are waiting. A sample entry would look like the following:\nApril 5, 2015\nBuy AUDUSD on a break of 0.7850 (previous day high)\nStop at 0.7800 (50-day SMA)\nTarget 1—0.7925 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement of Nov-Mar bull wave)\nTarget 2—0.8075 (Upper Bollinger)\nTarget 3—10-day Trailing Low\nAs soon as your entry level is reached, you know exactly how to take action and\nwhere to place your stops and limits. Of course, it is also important to take a quick\nglance at the market to make sure that the trading conditions that you were waiting\nfor are still intact. For example, if you were looking for a strong breakout with no\nretracement to occur at the entry level, when it does break, you want to make sure\nthat the break has decent momentum. This exercise will help you develop a plan of\naction to approach your trading day. Before every battle, warriors will regroup to\ngo over the plan of attack—in trading, you want to have the same mentality. Plan\nand prepare for the worst-case scenario and know your plan of attack for the day!\nExisting or Completed Trades\nThis section is developed and used to enforce discipline and to learn from your\nmistakes. At the end of each trading day, it is important to review this section to\nunderstand why certain trades resulted in losses and others in proﬁts. The purpose\nof this section is to identify trends. To understand why this is important, let’s look\nat an example that is completely unrelated to trading. On a normal given day,\nmost people will subconsciously inject a lot of ‘‘ums’’ or ‘‘uhs’’ into their daily\nconversation. However, most of these people do not even realize that they are even\ndoing so until someone records their conversation and replays it back to them. This\nis one of the ways that professional presenters and newscasters train to kick the\nhabit of using placeholder words. Having worked with over 65,000 traders, too\noften have I seen these traders make the same mistakes repeatedly. This includes\ntaking proﬁts too early, letting losses run, getting emotional about trading, ignoring\neconomic releases, or entering a trade prematurely. Keeping a record of previous\ntrades is like keeping a recording of your conversations. When you ﬂip back to the\ntrades that you have completed, you may have a perfect map of what strategies have\nor have not been proﬁtable for you. The reason why a journal is so important is\nbecause it minimizes the emotional intervention of trades. I frequently see novice\ntraders take proﬁts early but let losses run. The following are two samples of trade\njournal entries that could have provided learning opportunities:\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS79February 12, 2015\nTrade: Short 3 lots of EURUSD @ 1.1045\nStop: 1.1195 (former all-time high)\nTarget: 1.0800\nResult: Trade closed on Feb 13, 2015—stopped out of the 3 lots @ 1.1195\n(–150 pips)\nComments: Got margin call! It broke the all-time high, I thought it was going\nto reverse, did not stick to stop—kept letting losses run, eventually margin\ncall closed out all positions. Note to self: MAKE SURE STICK TO STOPS!\nApril 3, 2015\nTrade: Long 2 lots of USDCAD @ 1.2135\nStop: 1.2000 (strong technical support—conﬂuence of 50-day moving average\nand 68% Fibonacci retracement of Feb—March rally)\nTarget: First lot @ 1.2295 (upper Bollinger and 5 pips shy of 1.2300 psychological\nresistance)\nSecond lot @ 1.2450 (Former head and shoulders support turned resistance,\n100-day SMA)\nResult: Trade closed on April 5, 2015—stopped out of the 2 lots at 1.2000\n(–135 pips)\nComments: USDCAD did not continue uptrend and was becoming overbought,\nI didn’t see that ADX was weakening and falling from higher levels, there was\nalso a divergence in Stochastics. Note to self: MAKE SURE TO LOOK FOR\nDIVERGENCES NEXT TIME!\nUnlike many traders, the best trades in my opinion are the trades where both\ntechnicals and fundamentals support the trade. In general, I prefer to stay out of\ntrades that contradict my fundamental outlook. For example, if there is a bullish\nformation in both the GBPUSD and the AUDUSD due to U.S. dollar weakness,\nbut the Bank of England has ﬁnished raising interest rates, while the Reserve\nBank of Australia has full intentions of tightening to tame the strength of the\nAustralian economy, I would most likely choose to express my bearish dollar view\nin the AUDUSD rather than the GBPUSD. My bias for choosing the AUDUSD\nover the GBPUSD would be even stronger if the AUDUSD already offered a\nhigher interest rate differential than the GBPUSD. I seen technicals thwarted by\nfundamentals so often that now I always incorporate both into my trading strategy.\nI use a combination of technical, fundamental, and positioning, and am generally\nalso a trend follower. I also typically use a top-down approach that involves the\nfollowing:\n1. I will start by taking an overall technical survey of the market and pick the\ncurrency pairs that have retraced to attractive levels for entry in order to\nparticipate in a medium term fundamentally supportive trend.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS802. For currencies with a dollar component (i.e., not the crosses), I determine if my\ninitial technical view for that pair coincides with my fundamental view on the\ndollar, as well as my view on how upcoming U.S. releases may impact trading\nfor the day. The reason why I look at the dollar speciﬁcally is because 80% of all\ncurrency trades involve the dollar, which makes U.S. fundamentals particularly\nimportant.\n3. If it is a cross, I will proceed by determining if the technical view coincides with\nthe fundamental outlook using Fibonacci retracements, ADX, moving averages,\noscillators, and other technical tools.\n4. Then I like to look at positioning using the Commitment of Traders Report or\nthe FXCM Speculative Sentiment index to see if it supports the trade.\n5. If I am left with two equally compelling trade ideas, I will choose the one with\na positive interest rate differential.\nHave a Toolbox—Use What Works for the Current Market\nEnvironment\nOnce you have created a trading journal, it is time to ﬁgure out which indicators to\nlay on your charts. The reason why a lot of traders fail is because they neglect to\nrealize that their favorite indicators are not foolproof. Buying when stochastics are\nin oversold territory and selling when it is in overbought territory is a strategy that\nis used quite often by range traders, to a great deal of success, but once the market\nstops range trading and begins to trend, then relying on stochastics could lead to\ntremendous amount of losses. In order to become consistently proﬁtable, successful\ntraders need to learn to be adaptable.\nOne of the most important practices that every trader must understand is to be\nconscious of the environment that they are trading in. Every trader needs to have\nsome sort of checklist that will help to classify the trading environment so that\nthey can determine whether the market is trending or range bound. Deﬁning\ntrade parameters is one of the most important disciplines of trading. Too many\ntraders have tried to pick the top within a trend, only to wind up with consistently\nunproﬁtable trades.\nAlthough deﬁning trade parameters is important to traders in any market\n(currencies, futures, equities), it is particularly important in the currency market\nsince over 80% of the volume is speculative in nature. This means that currencies\ncan spend a very long period of time in a certain trading environment. Also, the\ncurrency market obeys technical analysis particularly well, given its large scale and\nnumber of participants.\nThere are basically two types of trading environments, which means that at any\npoint in time an instrument is either range trading or trending. The ﬁrst step every\ntrader needs to take is to deﬁne the current trading environment. The shortest time\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS81frame that traders should start looking at when their trading day starts are daily\ncharts, even if you are trading on a 5-minute time frame.\n■Step #1: Determine the Trading Environment\nRules to Determining Trading Environment\nThere are many different ways that traders can determine whether a currency pair\nis range trading or trending. Of course, many people do it visually, but having set\nrules will help to keep traders out of trends that may be fading or to prevent traders\nfrom getting into a range trade in the midst of a possible breakout. In Figure 7.3, I\nhave outlined some of the rules that I look for in order to classify a currency pair’s\ntrading environment.\nProﬁling a Range Environment\nLook for:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) less than 20 —The Average Directional Index is\none of the primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a\ntrend. When ADX is less than 20, this suggests that the trend is weak, which\nis generally characteristic of range-bound market. If ADX is less than 20 and\ntrending downward, it provides a further conﬁrmation that the trend is not only\nweak but will probably stay in a range-trading environment for a while longer.\n2.Decreasing implied volatility —There are many ways to analyze volatility. What I\nlike to do is actually track short-term versus long-term volatility. When short-\nterm volatility is falling, especially after a burst above long-term volatility, it\nis usually indicative of a reversion to range trading scenarios. Volatility usually\nTrade Rules Indicators\nRange ■ADX<20\n■Decreasing implied volatility\n■Risk reversals near choice or ﬂipping\nbetween favoring calls and putsBollinger, Bands, ADX,\nOptions\nTrend ■ADX>25\n■Momentum consistent with trend\ndirection\n■Risk reversals strongly bid for put or callMoving\naverages, ADX, Options,\nMomentum\nFIGURE 7.3 Trend/Range Trading Rules\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS82blows out when a currency pair experiences sharp, quick moves. It contracts\nwhen ranges are narrow and the trading is very quiet in the markets. The lazy\nman’s version of the way I track volatility is Bollinger Bands, which is actually\nalso a fairly decent measure for determining volatility conditions. A narrow\nBollinger Band suggests that ranges are small and there is low volatility in the\nmarkets, while wide Bollinger Bands are reﬂective of large ranges and a highly\nvolatile environment. In a range-trading environment, we are looking for fairly\nnarrow Bollinger Bands, ideally in a horizontal formation similar to the USDJPY\nchart in Figure 7.4.\n3.Risk reversals ﬂipping between calls and puts : A risk reversal consists of a pair of\noptions, a call and a put, on the same currency. Risk reversals have both the\nsame expiration (1 month) and sensitivity to the underlying spot rate. They are\nquoted in terms of the difference in volatility between the two options. While\nin theory these options should have the same implied volatility in practice, these\nvolatilities often differ in the market. Risk reversals can be seen as having a\nmarket polling function. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates\nthat the market prefers calls over puts. The reverse is true if the number is\nstrongly in favor of puts versus calls. Thus, risk reversals can be used as a\nsubstitute for gauging positions in the FX market. In an ideal environment, far\nout of the money calls and puts should have the same volatility. However, this\nis rarely the case, since there is generally a sentiment bias in the markets that\nis reﬂected in risk reversals. In range-bound environments, risk reversals tend\nFIGURE 7.4 USDJPY Bollinger Band Chart\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS83to ﬂip between favoring calls and puts at nearly zero (or equal). This indicates\nthat there is indecision among bulls and bears, and there is no strong bias in\nthe markets.\nWhat Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nAccording to the risk reversals in Figure 7.5, we can see that the market is strongly\nfavoring yen calls (JC) and dollar puts over the long term. EURUSD short-term\nrisk reversals are near choice, which is what you are looking for when proﬁling a\nrange-bound environment. Risk reversal information used to be readily available\nbut is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd these days. Currently, the only place we know of that\nprovides this information is the Bloomberg Professional Terminal, which costs over\nUS$1500 a month.\nIdentifying a Trending Environment\nLook for three things:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) greater than 20 —As mentioned earlier when we\ntalked about range-trading conditions, the Average Directional Index is one of\nthe primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a trend. In\na trending environment, we look for ADX to be greater than 25 and rising. If\nADX is greater than 25 but sloping downward, especially off of the extreme 40\nlevel, you have to be careful of aggressive trend positioning since it may indicate\nthat the trend is waning.\n2.Momentum consistent with trend direction —In addition to using ADX, I also\nrecommend looking for conﬁrmation of a trending environment through\nmomentum indicators. Traders should look for momentum to be consistent\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nCurrency 1M R/R 3M R/R 6M R/R 1YR R/R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 JC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C=Japanese yen call * SC =Sterling call\n*E C=Euro call * CC =Swiss call\n*S P=Sterling put\nFIGURE 7.5 Risk Reversals\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS84with the direction of the trend. Most currency traders will look for oscillators to\npoint strongly in the direction of the trend. For example, in an uptrend, trend\ntraders will look for the moving averages, RSI, stochastics, and MACD to all\npoint strongly upward. In a downtrend, they will look for these same indicators\nto point downward. Some currency traders use the momentum index, but in\nmy experience, it is less popular and reliable. Instead, one of the strongest\nmomentum indicators is a perfect order of moving averages. A perfect order is\nwhen we have the moving averages line up perfectly: that is, for an uptrend,\nthe 10-day SMA is greater than the 20-day SMA, which is greater 50-day SMA.\nThe 100-day SMA and the 200-day SMA are below the shorter-term moving\naverages. In a downtrend, a perfect order would be when the shorter-term\nmoving averages stack up below the longer-term moving averages.\n3.Options (risk reversals)— With a trending environment, we are looking for risk\nreversals to strongly favor calls or puts. When one side of the market is laden\nwith interest, it is usually indicative of a strong trending environment or that a\ncontra-trend move may be brewing if risk reversals are at extreme levels.\n■Step #2: Determine the Time Frame for Trade\nOnce you have determined that a currency pair is either range-bound or trending,\nit is time to determine how long you plan on holding the trade. The following is a\nset of guidelines and indicators that I use for trading different time frames. Not all\nof the guidelines need to be met, but the more guidelines that are met, the more\nsolid the trading opportunity.\nIntraday Trade (Range)\nRules:\n1. Use hourly charts to determine entry points and daily charts to conﬁrm that a\nrange trade exists on a longer-time frame.\n2. Use oscillators to determine entry point within range.\n3. Look for short-dated risk reversals to be near choice.\n4. Look for reversal in oscillators (RSI or stochastics at extreme point).\n5. Trade stronger when prices fail at key resistance or hold key support levels (use\nFibonacci retracement points and moving averages).\nIndicators Used:\nStochastics, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, options, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS85Medium-Term Range Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. There are two ways to range trade medium term—position for upcoming range\ntrading opportunities or get involved in existing ranges.\n3.Upcoming range opportunities : Look for high-volatility environments, where short-\nterm implied volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than longer-term volatilities.\nSeek reversion back to the mean environments.\n4.Existing ranges : Use Bollinger Bands to identify existing ranges.\n5. Look for reversals in oscillators such as RSI and stochastics.\n6. Make sure ADX is below 25 and ideally falling.\n7. Look for medium-term risk reversals near choice.\n8. Conﬁrm with price action—failure at key range resistances and bounces on key\nrange supports (using traditional technical indicators).\nIndicators:\nOptions, Bollinger Bands, stochastics, MACD, RSI, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nMedium-Term Trend Trade\nRules:\n1. Look for ranges on daily charts and use weekly charts for conﬁrmation.\n2. Refer back to the characteristics of a trending environment—look for those\nparameters to be met.\n3. Buy breakout/retracement scenarios on key Fibonacci levels or moving averages.\n4. Look for no major resistance levels in front of trade.\n5. Look for candlestick pattern conﬁrmation.\n6. Look for moving average conﬂuence to be on same side of trade.\n7. Enter on a break of signiﬁcant high or low.\n8. The ideal is to wait for volatilities to contract before getting in.\n9. Look for fundamentals to also be supportive of trade—growth and interest\nrates. You want to see a string of economic surprises or disappointments\ndepending on directional bias.\nIndicators\nADX, Parabolic SAR, RSI, Ichimoku Clouds, Elliot waves, Fibonacci\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS86Medium-Term Breakout Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. Look for contraction in short-term volatility to a point where it is sharply below\nlong-term volatility.\n3. Use pivot points to determine whether a break is a true break or a false break.\n4. Look for moving average conﬂuences to be supportive of trade.\nIndicators\nBollinger Bands, moving averages, Fibonacci\n■Risk Management\nAlthough risk management is one of the more simple topics to grasp, it is also one\nof the most important. Too often we have seen traders turn winning positions into\nlosing positions and solid strategies result in losses instead of proﬁts. The fact of the\nmatter is that regardless of how intelligent and knowledgeable a trader may be about\nthe markets, their own psychology will cause them to lose money. Why does this\nhappen? Are the markets really so enigmatic that few can proﬁt? Or is there simply\na common mistake that virtually all traders are prone to making? The answer is the\nlatter. And the good news is that the problem, while it can be an emotionally and\npsychologically challenging, is ultimately fairly easy to grasp and solve.\nMost traders lose money simply because they have no understanding or place no\nimportance in risk management . Risk management involves essentially knowing how\nmuch you are willing to risk and how much you are looking to gain. Without a\nsense of risk management, most traders simply hold on to losing positions for an\nextremely long amount of time, but take proﬁts on winning positions prematurely.\nThe result is a seemingly paradoxical scenario that in reality is all too common: The\ntrader ends up having more winning positions than losing ones, but ends up with a\nnegative P/L. So, what can traders do to ensure they have solid risk management\nhabits? There are a few key guidelines that every trader, regardless of their strategy\nor what they are trading, should keep in mind:\n■Risk-reward ratio . Traders should look to establish a risk-reward ratio for every\ntrade they place. In other words, they should have an idea of how much they are\nwilling to lose, and how much they are looking to gain. Generally, the risk-reward\nratio should be at least 1:2, if not more. Having a solid risk-reward ratio can\nprevent traders from entering positions that ultimately are not worth the risk.\n■Stop-loss orders . Traders should also employ stop-loss orders as a way of specifying\nthe maximum loss they are willing to accept. By using stop-loss orders, traders\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS87can avoid the common predicament of being in a scenario where they have many\nwinning trades but a single loss large enough to eliminate any trace of proﬁtability\nin the account. Trailing stops to lock in proﬁts are particularly useful. A good\nhabit of more successful traders is to employ the rule of moving your stop to\nbreak even as soon as your position has proﬁted by the same amount that you\ninitially risked through the stop order. At the same time, some traders may also\nchoose to close a portion of their position.\nFor those looking to add to a winning position or go with trend, the best strategy\nis to treat it as if it were a new trade of its own, independent of the winning position.\nIf you are going to add to a winning position, perform the same analysis of the chart\nthat you would if you had no position at all. If a trade continues to go in your favor,\nyou can also close out part of the position while trailing your stop higher on the\nremaining lots that you are holding. Try thinking about your risk and reward on\neach separate lot that you have bought if they are at different entry points as well. If\nyou buy a second lot 50 pips above your ﬁrst entry point, don’t use the same stop\nprice on both, but manage the risk on the second lot independently from the ﬁrst.\nUsing Stop-Loss Orders to Manage Risk\nGiven the importance of money management to successful trading, using the stop-\nloss order is imperative for any trader looking to succeed in the currency market.\nStop-loss orders allow traders to specify the maximum loss they are willing to\naccept on any given trade. If the market reaches the rate the trader speciﬁes in\nhis/her stop-loss order, then the trade will be closed immediately. As a result, using\nstop-loss orders allows you to know how much you are risking at the time you enter\nthe trade.\nThere are two parts to successfully using a stop-loss order: (1) initially placing\nthe stop at a reasonable level and (2) trailing the stop—or moving it forward toward\nproﬁtability—as the trade progresses in your favor.\nPlacing the Stop Loss\nWe recommend two ways of placing a trailing stop-loss order:\n■The ﬁrst is a two-day low method . These volatility-based stops involve placing your\nstop-loss order approximately 10 to 20 pips below the two-day low of the pair.\nFor example, if the low on the EURUSD’s most recent candle was 1.1200, and\nthe previous candle’s low was 1.1100, then the stop should be placed around\n1.1090—10 pips below the two-day low—if a trader is looking to get long. This\ntype of trailing stop allows you to keep tight control of the position and minimizes\nthe time in trade. The downside is that it can be closed prematurely during a brief\nperiod of consolidation.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS88■Parabolic SAR . Another form of volatility-based stop is the parabolic SAR, an\nindicator that is found on many currency trading charting applications. This\nindicator graphically displays a small dot at the point on the chart where the stop\nshould be placed. The beneﬁt of parabolic SAR is that it is dynamic and generally\nfurther away from the current price.\nThere is no magic formula for what works best in every situation, but the\nfollowing is an example of how these stops could be used.\nUpon entering a long position, determine where support is and place a stop 20\npips below support. For example, let’s say this is 60 pips below the entry point. If\nthe trade earns a proﬁt of 60 pips, close half of my position using a market order,\nthen move the stop up to the entry point. At this point, trail the stop 60 pips behind\nthe moving market price. If the parabolic SAR moves up so that it is above the entry\npoint, you could switch to using parabolic SAR as the stop level. Of course, during\nthe day, there can be other signals that could prompt you to move your stop. If the\nprice breaks through a new resistance level, that resistance then becomes support.\nYou can place a stop 20 pips below that support level, even if it is only 30–40\npips away from the current price. The underlying principle you have to use is to\nﬁnd a point to place your stop where you would no longer want to be in the trade\nonce the price reaches that level. Usually it falls at a point where the price goes\nbelow support.\nAside from employing proper risk management strategies, one of the other\nmore crucial yet overlooked elements of successful trading is maintaining a healthy\npsychological outlook. At the end of the day, a trader who is unable to cope with the\nstress of market ﬂuctuations will not stand the test of time—no matter how skilled\nthey may be at the more scientiﬁc elements of trading. Here are some tips:\n■Practice emotional detachment . That is, traders must make trading decisions based on\nstrategies independent of fear and greed. One of the premiere attributes a good\ntrader has is emotional detachment: While these traders are dedicated and fully\ninvolved in their trades, they are not emotionally married to them; they accept\nlosing, and make their investment decisions on an intellectual level. Traders who\nare emotionally involved in trading often make substantial errors, as they tend\nto whimsically change their strategy after a few losing trades, or become overly\ncarefree after a few winning trades. A good trader must be emotionally balanced,\nand must base all trading decisions on strategy—not fear or greed.\n■Know when to take a break . In the midst of a losing streak, consider taking a break\nfrom trading before fear and greed dominate your strategy.\nNot every trade can be a winning one. As a result, traders must be psycholog-\nically capable of coping with losses. Most traders, even successful ones, will go\nthrough a stretch of losing trades. The key to being a successful trader, though,\nis being able to go through a losing stretch unfazed and undeterred. If you are\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS89experiencing a string of losing trades, it may be time to take a break from trading.\nOften, taking a few days off from watching the market to clear your mind can be\nthe best remedy for a losing streak. Continuing to trade relentlessly during a tough\nmarket condition can breed greater losses and ruin your psychological trading\ncapacity. Ultimately, it’s always better to acknowledge your losses rather than\ncontinue to ﬁght through them and pretend they don’t exist. Make no mistake\nabout it: Regardless of how much you study, practice, or trade, there will be losing\ntrades throughout your entire career. The key is to make them small enough that\nyou can live to trade another day and allow your winning trades room to breathe\nand ﬂourish. You can overcome a lot of bad luck with proper money management\ntechniques. This is why we have stressed a 2:1 reward to risk ratio, and why we\nrecommend not risking more than 2% of your equity on any single trade.\nWhether you are trading forex, equities, or futures, there are 10 trading rules\nthat successful traders should live by:\n1. Limit your losses.\n2. Let your proﬁts run.\n3. Keep position sizes within reason.\n4. Know your risk versus reward ratio.\n5. Be adequately capitalized.\n6. Don’t ﬁght the trend.\n7. Never add to losing positions.\n8. Know market expectations.\n9. Learn from your mistake—keep a trade log.\n10. Have a maximum drawdown.",
        "73CHAPTER 7\nTrade Parameters\nfor Various Market\nConditions\nAfter learning about the emergence of the foreign exchange market, who the\nmajor players are, signiﬁcant historical milestones, and what moves the markets,\nit is time to move on and discuss some of my favorite strategies for trading currencies.\nHowever, before I even begin going over these strategies, the most important ﬁrst\nstep for any trader, regardless of the market that you are trading in, is to create a\ntrading journal.\n■Keep a Trading Journal\nThrough my experience, I have learned that being a successful trader is not about\nﬁnding the holy grail of indicators that can perfectly forecast movements 100% of\nthe time, but instead, to develop discipline. I cannot undermine the importance of\n‘‘the journal’’ as the primary ﬁrst step to becoming a successful and professional\ntrader. While working on the Inter-bank FX trading desk at J.P. Morgan and then\non the Cross-Markets trading desk after the merger with Chase, the trading journal\nmentality was engrained into the minds of every dealer and proprietary trader on the\ntrading ﬂoors, regardless of rank. The reason was simple—the bank was providing\nthe capital for trading and we needed to be held accountable, especially since each\ntransaction involved millions of dollars. For every trade that was executed, we\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS74needed to have a solid rationale as well as justiﬁcation for the choice of entry and exit\nlevels. More speciﬁcally, you had to know where to place your exit points before\nyou placed the trade to approximate worst case losses and to manage risk.\nWith this sort of accountability, the leading banks of the world are able to breed\nsuccessful and professional traders. For individual traders, this practice is even more\nimportant because you are trading with your own money and not someone else’s.\nBank traders are trading with someone else’s money so regardless of how poorly\nthey perform over a one- or two-week basis, they will receive their paycheck twice\na month. At a bank, traders have plenty of time to make the money back without any\ndisruptions to their daily way of life—unless of course they lose $1 million in one\nday. As an individual trader—you do not have this luxury. When you are trading\nwith your own money, each dollar lost is a dollar less that you own. So even though\nyou should only be trading with risk capital, or money that would not otherwise be\nused for rent or groceries, one way or the other, the pain is felt. To avoid repeating\nthe same mistakes and taking large losses, I cannot stress enough the importance of\nkeeping a trading journal. The journal is designed to ensure that as a trader, you\nonly take calculated losses and learn from each mistake. The trading journal setup\nthat I recommend should be broken up into three parts:\n1. Currency pair checklist\n2. Trades that I am waiting for\n3. Existing or completed trades\nCurrency Pair Checklist\nThe ﬁrst section of your trading journal should consist of a spreadsheet that can be\nprinted out and completed every day. This purpose of this checklist is to get a feel\nof the market and to identify trades. It should list of all of the currency pairs that are\noffered for trading on the left column, followed by three columns for the current,\nhigh, and low prices, and then a series of triggers laid out as a row on the right\nhand side. Newer traders should start with following only the four major currency\npairs, which are the EURUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, and the GBPUSD, and then\ngradually add the AUDUSD, USDCAD, and NZDUSD, followed by the nondollar\npairs. Although the checklist that I have created is fairly detailed, I ﬁnd that it is\na very useful daily exercise and should take no more than 20 minutes to complete\nonce the appropriate indicators are saved on the charts. The purpose of this checklist\nis to get a clear visual of which currencies are trending and which are range trading.\nComprehending the big picture is the ﬁrst step to trading successfully. Too often\nhave I seen traders fail because they lose sight of the overall environment that they\nare trading in. The worst thing to do is to trade blindly. Trying to pick tops or\nbottoms in a strong trend or buying breakouts in a range-bound environment can\nlead to signiﬁcant losses. Just take a look at Figure 7.1 of the EURUSD. If you tried\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS75\nFIGURE 7.1 EURUSD Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS76to pick bottoms in this pair, it would have led to an entire year of frustrating and\nunsuccessful trading. In trending environments, traders will ﬁnd a higher success\nrate by buying on retracements in an uptrend or selling on rallies in a downtrend.\nPicking tops and bottoms should only be a strategy that is used in clear range trading\nenvironments and even with that, traders need to be careful of contracting ranges\nthat can lead to breakout scenarios.\nA simpliﬁed version of the daily market overview sheet that I use is shown in\nFigure 7.2.\nAs you can see in Figure 7.2, the ﬁrst two columns after the daily high and low\nprices are the levels of the 10-day high or low. Recording this price helps to identify\nwhere current prices are within previous price action. This helps traders get a gauge\nof whether we are pressing toward a 10-day high or low or if we are simply trapped\nin the middle of the range. Yet the prices alone do not provide enough information\nto determine if we are in a trending or a range-bound environment. The next ﬁve\nindicators is a checklist for determining a trending environment. The more X marks\nin this section, the stronger the trend.\nThe ﬁrst column in the trending indicator group is the ‘‘ADX (14) above 25.’’\nADX is the Accumulation Distribution Index, which is the most popular used\nindicator for determining the strength of a trend. If the index reading is above 25,\nit indicates that a trend has developed. Generally speaking, the greater the number,\nthe stronger the trend. The next column is Bollinger Bands. When strong trends\ndevelop, the pair will frequently tag and cross either the upper or lower Bollinger\nBand. The next three trend indicators are the longer term moving averages. A\nbreak above or below these moving averages may also be indicative of a trending\nenvironment. With moving averages, crossovers in the direction of the trend can be\nused as a further conﬁrmation. If there are two or more Xs in this section, traders\nshould be looking for opportunities to buy on dips in an uptrend or sell on rallies in a\ndowntrend rather than selling at the top and buying back at the bottom of the range.\nThe last section of the trading journal is indications of range. The ﬁrst indicator is\nalso ADX, but this time, we are looking for ADX below 25, which signals that the\ncurrency pair’s trend is weak. Next, we look at the traditional oscillators, RSI and\nstochastics. If the ADX is weak and there is signiﬁcant technical resistance above,\nprovided by indicators such as moving averages or Fibonacci retracement levels,\nand RSI and/or stochastics are at overbought or oversold levels, we identify an\nenvironment that is highly conducive to range trading.\nOf course, the market overview sheet is not foolproof, and just because you have\na lot of X marks in either the trend or range group doesn’t mean that a trend will\nnot fade or a breakout will not occur. Yet, what this spreadsheet will do is prevent\ntraders from trading blindly and ignoring the broader market conditions. It provides\ntraders with a launching pad from which to identify the day’s trading opportunities.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS77Date - Time\nTrending Range\nCurrencyPair Current\nPriceDaily\nHighDaily\nLow10-day\nHigh10-day\nLowBollinger\nBand UpBollinger\nBand Down(14)\nabove 25Crosses\n50-DayCrosses\n100-dayCrosses\n200-dayBollinger\nBand\nRangeADX\n(14)\nbelow\n25RS1 (14)\nGreater\nthan 80(14)\nLess\nthan 80Stochastics\n>70Stochastics\n<30\nEURUSD 1.105 1.1144 1.0923 X X X X\nGBPUSD\nUSDJPY\nUSDCHF\nAUDUSD\nNZDUSD\nUSDCAD\nEURJPY\nEURGBP\nEURCHF\nAUDJPY\nCHFJPY\nGBPJPY\nGBPCHF\nAUDCAD\nEURCAD\nAUDNZD\nFIGURE 7.2 Currency Checklist\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS78Trades That I Am Waiting For\nThe next section in the trading journal lists out the possible trades for the day. Based\non an initial overview of the charts, this section is where you should list the trades\nfor which you are waiting. A sample entry would look like the following:\nApril 5, 2015\nBuy AUDUSD on a break of 0.7850 (previous day high)\nStop at 0.7800 (50-day SMA)\nTarget 1—0.7925 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement of Nov-Mar bull wave)\nTarget 2—0.8075 (Upper Bollinger)\nTarget 3—10-day Trailing Low\nAs soon as your entry level is reached, you know exactly how to take action and\nwhere to place your stops and limits. Of course, it is also important to take a quick\nglance at the market to make sure that the trading conditions that you were waiting\nfor are still intact. For example, if you were looking for a strong breakout with no\nretracement to occur at the entry level, when it does break, you want to make sure\nthat the break has decent momentum. This exercise will help you develop a plan of\naction to approach your trading day. Before every battle, warriors will regroup to\ngo over the plan of attack—in trading, you want to have the same mentality. Plan\nand prepare for the worst-case scenario and know your plan of attack for the day!\nExisting or Completed Trades\nThis section is developed and used to enforce discipline and to learn from your\nmistakes. At the end of each trading day, it is important to review this section to\nunderstand why certain trades resulted in losses and others in proﬁts. The purpose\nof this section is to identify trends. To understand why this is important, let’s look\nat an example that is completely unrelated to trading. On a normal given day,\nmost people will subconsciously inject a lot of ‘‘ums’’ or ‘‘uhs’’ into their daily\nconversation. However, most of these people do not even realize that they are even\ndoing so until someone records their conversation and replays it back to them. This\nis one of the ways that professional presenters and newscasters train to kick the\nhabit of using placeholder words. Having worked with over 65,000 traders, too\noften have I seen these traders make the same mistakes repeatedly. This includes\ntaking proﬁts too early, letting losses run, getting emotional about trading, ignoring\neconomic releases, or entering a trade prematurely. Keeping a record of previous\ntrades is like keeping a recording of your conversations. When you ﬂip back to the\ntrades that you have completed, you may have a perfect map of what strategies have\nor have not been proﬁtable for you. The reason why a journal is so important is\nbecause it minimizes the emotional intervention of trades. I frequently see novice\ntraders take proﬁts early but let losses run. The following are two samples of trade\njournal entries that could have provided learning opportunities:\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS79February 12, 2015\nTrade: Short 3 lots of EURUSD @ 1.1045\nStop: 1.1195 (former all-time high)\nTarget: 1.0800\nResult: Trade closed on Feb 13, 2015—stopped out of the 3 lots @ 1.1195\n(–150 pips)\nComments: Got margin call! It broke the all-time high, I thought it was going\nto reverse, did not stick to stop—kept letting losses run, eventually margin\ncall closed out all positions. Note to self: MAKE SURE STICK TO STOPS!\nApril 3, 2015\nTrade: Long 2 lots of USDCAD @ 1.2135\nStop: 1.2000 (strong technical support—conﬂuence of 50-day moving average\nand 68% Fibonacci retracement of Feb—March rally)\nTarget: First lot @ 1.2295 (upper Bollinger and 5 pips shy of 1.2300 psychological\nresistance)\nSecond lot @ 1.2450 (Former head and shoulders support turned resistance,\n100-day SMA)\nResult: Trade closed on April 5, 2015—stopped out of the 2 lots at 1.2000\n(–135 pips)\nComments: USDCAD did not continue uptrend and was becoming overbought,\nI didn’t see that ADX was weakening and falling from higher levels, there was\nalso a divergence in Stochastics. Note to self: MAKE SURE TO LOOK FOR\nDIVERGENCES NEXT TIME!\nUnlike many traders, the best trades in my opinion are the trades where both\ntechnicals and fundamentals support the trade. In general, I prefer to stay out of\ntrades that contradict my fundamental outlook. For example, if there is a bullish\nformation in both the GBPUSD and the AUDUSD due to U.S. dollar weakness,\nbut the Bank of England has ﬁnished raising interest rates, while the Reserve\nBank of Australia has full intentions of tightening to tame the strength of the\nAustralian economy, I would most likely choose to express my bearish dollar view\nin the AUDUSD rather than the GBPUSD. My bias for choosing the AUDUSD\nover the GBPUSD would be even stronger if the AUDUSD already offered a\nhigher interest rate differential than the GBPUSD. I seen technicals thwarted by\nfundamentals so often that now I always incorporate both into my trading strategy.\nI use a combination of technical, fundamental, and positioning, and am generally\nalso a trend follower. I also typically use a top-down approach that involves the\nfollowing:\n1. I will start by taking an overall technical survey of the market and pick the\ncurrency pairs that have retraced to attractive levels for entry in order to\nparticipate in a medium term fundamentally supportive trend.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS802. For currencies with a dollar component (i.e., not the crosses), I determine if my\ninitial technical view for that pair coincides with my fundamental view on the\ndollar, as well as my view on how upcoming U.S. releases may impact trading\nfor the day. The reason why I look at the dollar speciﬁcally is because 80% of all\ncurrency trades involve the dollar, which makes U.S. fundamentals particularly\nimportant.\n3. If it is a cross, I will proceed by determining if the technical view coincides with\nthe fundamental outlook using Fibonacci retracements, ADX, moving averages,\noscillators, and other technical tools.\n4. Then I like to look at positioning using the Commitment of Traders Report or\nthe FXCM Speculative Sentiment index to see if it supports the trade.\n5. If I am left with two equally compelling trade ideas, I will choose the one with\na positive interest rate differential.\nHave a Toolbox—Use What Works for the Current Market\nEnvironment\nOnce you have created a trading journal, it is time to ﬁgure out which indicators to\nlay on your charts. The reason why a lot of traders fail is because they neglect to\nrealize that their favorite indicators are not foolproof. Buying when stochastics are\nin oversold territory and selling when it is in overbought territory is a strategy that\nis used quite often by range traders, to a great deal of success, but once the market\nstops range trading and begins to trend, then relying on stochastics could lead to\ntremendous amount of losses. In order to become consistently proﬁtable, successful\ntraders need to learn to be adaptable.\nOne of the most important practices that every trader must understand is to be\nconscious of the environment that they are trading in. Every trader needs to have\nsome sort of checklist that will help to classify the trading environment so that\nthey can determine whether the market is trending or range bound. Deﬁning\ntrade parameters is one of the most important disciplines of trading. Too many\ntraders have tried to pick the top within a trend, only to wind up with consistently\nunproﬁtable trades.\nAlthough deﬁning trade parameters is important to traders in any market\n(currencies, futures, equities), it is particularly important in the currency market\nsince over 80% of the volume is speculative in nature. This means that currencies\ncan spend a very long period of time in a certain trading environment. Also, the\ncurrency market obeys technical analysis particularly well, given its large scale and\nnumber of participants.\nThere are basically two types of trading environments, which means that at any\npoint in time an instrument is either range trading or trending. The ﬁrst step every\ntrader needs to take is to deﬁne the current trading environment. The shortest time\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS81frame that traders should start looking at when their trading day starts are daily\ncharts, even if you are trading on a 5-minute time frame.\n■Step #1: Determine the Trading Environment\nRules to Determining Trading Environment\nThere are many different ways that traders can determine whether a currency pair\nis range trading or trending. Of course, many people do it visually, but having set\nrules will help to keep traders out of trends that may be fading or to prevent traders\nfrom getting into a range trade in the midst of a possible breakout. In Figure 7.3, I\nhave outlined some of the rules that I look for in order to classify a currency pair’s\ntrading environment.\nProﬁling a Range Environment\nLook for:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) less than 20 —The Average Directional Index is\none of the primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a\ntrend. When ADX is less than 20, this suggests that the trend is weak, which\nis generally characteristic of range-bound market. If ADX is less than 20 and\ntrending downward, it provides a further conﬁrmation that the trend is not only\nweak but will probably stay in a range-trading environment for a while longer.\n2.Decreasing implied volatility —There are many ways to analyze volatility. What I\nlike to do is actually track short-term versus long-term volatility. When short-\nterm volatility is falling, especially after a burst above long-term volatility, it\nis usually indicative of a reversion to range trading scenarios. Volatility usually\nTrade Rules Indicators\nRange ■ADX<20\n■Decreasing implied volatility\n■Risk reversals near choice or ﬂipping\nbetween favoring calls and putsBollinger, Bands, ADX,\nOptions\nTrend ■ADX>25\n■Momentum consistent with trend\ndirection\n■Risk reversals strongly bid for put or callMoving\naverages, ADX, Options,\nMomentum\nFIGURE 7.3 Trend/Range Trading Rules\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS82blows out when a currency pair experiences sharp, quick moves. It contracts\nwhen ranges are narrow and the trading is very quiet in the markets. The lazy\nman’s version of the way I track volatility is Bollinger Bands, which is actually\nalso a fairly decent measure for determining volatility conditions. A narrow\nBollinger Band suggests that ranges are small and there is low volatility in the\nmarkets, while wide Bollinger Bands are reﬂective of large ranges and a highly\nvolatile environment. In a range-trading environment, we are looking for fairly\nnarrow Bollinger Bands, ideally in a horizontal formation similar to the USDJPY\nchart in Figure 7.4.\n3.Risk reversals ﬂipping between calls and puts : A risk reversal consists of a pair of\noptions, a call and a put, on the same currency. Risk reversals have both the\nsame expiration (1 month) and sensitivity to the underlying spot rate. They are\nquoted in terms of the difference in volatility between the two options. While\nin theory these options should have the same implied volatility in practice, these\nvolatilities often differ in the market. Risk reversals can be seen as having a\nmarket polling function. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates\nthat the market prefers calls over puts. The reverse is true if the number is\nstrongly in favor of puts versus calls. Thus, risk reversals can be used as a\nsubstitute for gauging positions in the FX market. In an ideal environment, far\nout of the money calls and puts should have the same volatility. However, this\nis rarely the case, since there is generally a sentiment bias in the markets that\nis reﬂected in risk reversals. In range-bound environments, risk reversals tend\nFIGURE 7.4 USDJPY Bollinger Band Chart\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS83to ﬂip between favoring calls and puts at nearly zero (or equal). This indicates\nthat there is indecision among bulls and bears, and there is no strong bias in\nthe markets.\nWhat Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nAccording to the risk reversals in Figure 7.5, we can see that the market is strongly\nfavoring yen calls (JC) and dollar puts over the long term. EURUSD short-term\nrisk reversals are near choice, which is what you are looking for when proﬁling a\nrange-bound environment. Risk reversal information used to be readily available\nbut is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd these days. Currently, the only place we know of that\nprovides this information is the Bloomberg Professional Terminal, which costs over\nUS$1500 a month.\nIdentifying a Trending Environment\nLook for three things:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) greater than 20 —As mentioned earlier when we\ntalked about range-trading conditions, the Average Directional Index is one of\nthe primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a trend. In\na trending environment, we look for ADX to be greater than 25 and rising. If\nADX is greater than 25 but sloping downward, especially off of the extreme 40\nlevel, you have to be careful of aggressive trend positioning since it may indicate\nthat the trend is waning.\n2.Momentum consistent with trend direction —In addition to using ADX, I also\nrecommend looking for conﬁrmation of a trending environment through\nmomentum indicators. Traders should look for momentum to be consistent\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nCurrency 1M R/R 3M R/R 6M R/R 1YR R/R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 JC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C=Japanese yen call * SC =Sterling call\n*E C=Euro call * CC =Swiss call\n*S P=Sterling put\nFIGURE 7.5 Risk Reversals\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS84with the direction of the trend. Most currency traders will look for oscillators to\npoint strongly in the direction of the trend. For example, in an uptrend, trend\ntraders will look for the moving averages, RSI, stochastics, and MACD to all\npoint strongly upward. In a downtrend, they will look for these same indicators\nto point downward. Some currency traders use the momentum index, but in\nmy experience, it is less popular and reliable. Instead, one of the strongest\nmomentum indicators is a perfect order of moving averages. A perfect order is\nwhen we have the moving averages line up perfectly: that is, for an uptrend,\nthe 10-day SMA is greater than the 20-day SMA, which is greater 50-day SMA.\nThe 100-day SMA and the 200-day SMA are below the shorter-term moving\naverages. In a downtrend, a perfect order would be when the shorter-term\nmoving averages stack up below the longer-term moving averages.\n3.Options (risk reversals)— With a trending environment, we are looking for risk\nreversals to strongly favor calls or puts. When one side of the market is laden\nwith interest, it is usually indicative of a strong trending environment or that a\ncontra-trend move may be brewing if risk reversals are at extreme levels.\n■Step #2: Determine the Time Frame for Trade\nOnce you have determined that a currency pair is either range-bound or trending,\nit is time to determine how long you plan on holding the trade. The following is a\nset of guidelines and indicators that I use for trading different time frames. Not all\nof the guidelines need to be met, but the more guidelines that are met, the more\nsolid the trading opportunity.\nIntraday Trade (Range)\nRules:\n1. Use hourly charts to determine entry points and daily charts to conﬁrm that a\nrange trade exists on a longer-time frame.\n2. Use oscillators to determine entry point within range.\n3. Look for short-dated risk reversals to be near choice.\n4. Look for reversal in oscillators (RSI or stochastics at extreme point).\n5. Trade stronger when prices fail at key resistance or hold key support levels (use\nFibonacci retracement points and moving averages).\nIndicators Used:\nStochastics, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, options, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS85Medium-Term Range Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. There are two ways to range trade medium term—position for upcoming range\ntrading opportunities or get involved in existing ranges.\n3.Upcoming range opportunities : Look for high-volatility environments, where short-\nterm implied volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than longer-term volatilities.\nSeek reversion back to the mean environments.\n4.Existing ranges : Use Bollinger Bands to identify existing ranges.\n5. Look for reversals in oscillators such as RSI and stochastics.\n6. Make sure ADX is below 25 and ideally falling.\n7. Look for medium-term risk reversals near choice.\n8. Conﬁrm with price action—failure at key range resistances and bounces on key\nrange supports (using traditional technical indicators).\nIndicators:\nOptions, Bollinger Bands, stochastics, MACD, RSI, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nMedium-Term Trend Trade\nRules:\n1. Look for ranges on daily charts and use weekly charts for conﬁrmation.\n2. Refer back to the characteristics of a trending environment—look for those\nparameters to be met.\n3. Buy breakout/retracement scenarios on key Fibonacci levels or moving averages.\n4. Look for no major resistance levels in front of trade.\n5. Look for candlestick pattern conﬁrmation.\n6. Look for moving average conﬂuence to be on same side of trade.\n7. Enter on a break of signiﬁcant high or low.\n8. The ideal is to wait for volatilities to contract before getting in.\n9. Look for fundamentals to also be supportive of trade—growth and interest\nrates. You want to see a string of economic surprises or disappointments\ndepending on directional bias.\nIndicators\nADX, Parabolic SAR, RSI, Ichimoku Clouds, Elliot waves, Fibonacci\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS86Medium-Term Breakout Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. Look for contraction in short-term volatility to a point where it is sharply below\nlong-term volatility.\n3. Use pivot points to determine whether a break is a true break or a false break.\n4. Look for moving average conﬂuences to be supportive of trade.\nIndicators\nBollinger Bands, moving averages, Fibonacci\n■Risk Management\nAlthough risk management is one of the more simple topics to grasp, it is also one\nof the most important. Too often we have seen traders turn winning positions into\nlosing positions and solid strategies result in losses instead of proﬁts. The fact of the\nmatter is that regardless of how intelligent and knowledgeable a trader may be about\nthe markets, their own psychology will cause them to lose money. Why does this\nhappen? Are the markets really so enigmatic that few can proﬁt? Or is there simply\na common mistake that virtually all traders are prone to making? The answer is the\nlatter. And the good news is that the problem, while it can be an emotionally and\npsychologically challenging, is ultimately fairly easy to grasp and solve.\nMost traders lose money simply because they have no understanding or place no\nimportance in risk management . Risk management involves essentially knowing how\nmuch you are willing to risk and how much you are looking to gain. Without a\nsense of risk management, most traders simply hold on to losing positions for an\nextremely long amount of time, but take proﬁts on winning positions prematurely.\nThe result is a seemingly paradoxical scenario that in reality is all too common: The\ntrader ends up having more winning positions than losing ones, but ends up with a\nnegative P/L. So, what can traders do to ensure they have solid risk management\nhabits? There are a few key guidelines that every trader, regardless of their strategy\nor what they are trading, should keep in mind:\n■Risk-reward ratio . Traders should look to establish a risk-reward ratio for every\ntrade they place. In other words, they should have an idea of how much they are\nwilling to lose, and how much they are looking to gain. Generally, the risk-reward\nratio should be at least 1:2, if not more. Having a solid risk-reward ratio can\nprevent traders from entering positions that ultimately are not worth the risk.\n■Stop-loss orders . Traders should also employ stop-loss orders as a way of specifying\nthe maximum loss they are willing to accept. By using stop-loss orders, traders\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS87can avoid the common predicament of being in a scenario where they have many\nwinning trades but a single loss large enough to eliminate any trace of proﬁtability\nin the account. Trailing stops to lock in proﬁts are particularly useful. A good\nhabit of more successful traders is to employ the rule of moving your stop to\nbreak even as soon as your position has proﬁted by the same amount that you\ninitially risked through the stop order. At the same time, some traders may also\nchoose to close a portion of their position.\nFor those looking to add to a winning position or go with trend, the best strategy\nis to treat it as if it were a new trade of its own, independent of the winning position.\nIf you are going to add to a winning position, perform the same analysis of the chart\nthat you would if you had no position at all. If a trade continues to go in your favor,\nyou can also close out part of the position while trailing your stop higher on the\nremaining lots that you are holding. Try thinking about your risk and reward on\neach separate lot that you have bought if they are at different entry points as well. If\nyou buy a second lot 50 pips above your ﬁrst entry point, don’t use the same stop\nprice on both, but manage the risk on the second lot independently from the ﬁrst.\nUsing Stop-Loss Orders to Manage Risk\nGiven the importance of money management to successful trading, using the stop-\nloss order is imperative for any trader looking to succeed in the currency market.\nStop-loss orders allow traders to specify the maximum loss they are willing to\naccept on any given trade. If the market reaches the rate the trader speciﬁes in\nhis/her stop-loss order, then the trade will be closed immediately. As a result, using\nstop-loss orders allows you to know how much you are risking at the time you enter\nthe trade.\nThere are two parts to successfully using a stop-loss order: (1) initially placing\nthe stop at a reasonable level and (2) trailing the stop—or moving it forward toward\nproﬁtability—as the trade progresses in your favor.\nPlacing the Stop Loss\nWe recommend two ways of placing a trailing stop-loss order:\n■The ﬁrst is a two-day low method . These volatility-based stops involve placing your\nstop-loss order approximately 10 to 20 pips below the two-day low of the pair.\nFor example, if the low on the EURUSD’s most recent candle was 1.1200, and\nthe previous candle’s low was 1.1100, then the stop should be placed around\n1.1090—10 pips below the two-day low—if a trader is looking to get long. This\ntype of trailing stop allows you to keep tight control of the position and minimizes\nthe time in trade. The downside is that it can be closed prematurely during a brief\nperiod of consolidation.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS88■Parabolic SAR . Another form of volatility-based stop is the parabolic SAR, an\nindicator that is found on many currency trading charting applications. This\nindicator graphically displays a small dot at the point on the chart where the stop\nshould be placed. The beneﬁt of parabolic SAR is that it is dynamic and generally\nfurther away from the current price.\nThere is no magic formula for what works best in every situation, but the\nfollowing is an example of how these stops could be used.\nUpon entering a long position, determine where support is and place a stop 20\npips below support. For example, let’s say this is 60 pips below the entry point. If\nthe trade earns a proﬁt of 60 pips, close half of my position using a market order,\nthen move the stop up to the entry point. At this point, trail the stop 60 pips behind\nthe moving market price. If the parabolic SAR moves up so that it is above the entry\npoint, you could switch to using parabolic SAR as the stop level. Of course, during\nthe day, there can be other signals that could prompt you to move your stop. If the\nprice breaks through a new resistance level, that resistance then becomes support.\nYou can place a stop 20 pips below that support level, even if it is only 30–40\npips away from the current price. The underlying principle you have to use is to\nﬁnd a point to place your stop where you would no longer want to be in the trade\nonce the price reaches that level. Usually it falls at a point where the price goes\nbelow support.\nAside from employing proper risk management strategies, one of the other\nmore crucial yet overlooked elements of successful trading is maintaining a healthy\npsychological outlook. At the end of the day, a trader who is unable to cope with the\nstress of market ﬂuctuations will not stand the test of time—no matter how skilled\nthey may be at the more scientiﬁc elements of trading. Here are some tips:\n■Practice emotional detachment . That is, traders must make trading decisions based on\nstrategies independent of fear and greed. One of the premiere attributes a good\ntrader has is emotional detachment: While these traders are dedicated and fully\ninvolved in their trades, they are not emotionally married to them; they accept\nlosing, and make their investment decisions on an intellectual level. Traders who\nare emotionally involved in trading often make substantial errors, as they tend\nto whimsically change their strategy after a few losing trades, or become overly\ncarefree after a few winning trades. A good trader must be emotionally balanced,\nand must base all trading decisions on strategy—not fear or greed.\n■Know when to take a break . In the midst of a losing streak, consider taking a break\nfrom trading before fear and greed dominate your strategy.\nNot every trade can be a winning one. As a result, traders must be psycholog-\nically capable of coping with losses. Most traders, even successful ones, will go\nthrough a stretch of losing trades. The key to being a successful trader, though,\nis being able to go through a losing stretch unfazed and undeterred. If you are\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS89experiencing a string of losing trades, it may be time to take a break from trading.\nOften, taking a few days off from watching the market to clear your mind can be\nthe best remedy for a losing streak. Continuing to trade relentlessly during a tough\nmarket condition can breed greater losses and ruin your psychological trading\ncapacity. Ultimately, it’s always better to acknowledge your losses rather than\ncontinue to ﬁght through them and pretend they don’t exist. Make no mistake\nabout it: Regardless of how much you study, practice, or trade, there will be losing\ntrades throughout your entire career. The key is to make them small enough that\nyou can live to trade another day and allow your winning trades room to breathe\nand ﬂourish. You can overcome a lot of bad luck with proper money management\ntechniques. This is why we have stressed a 2:1 reward to risk ratio, and why we\nrecommend not risking more than 2% of your equity on any single trade.\nWhether you are trading forex, equities, or futures, there are 10 trading rules\nthat successful traders should live by:\n1. Limit your losses.\n2. Let your proﬁts run.\n3. Keep position sizes within reason.\n4. Know your risk versus reward ratio.\n5. Be adequately capitalized.\n6. Don’t ﬁght the trend.\n7. Never add to losing positions.\n8. Know market expectations.\n9. Learn from your mistake—keep a trade log.\n10. Have a maximum drawdown."

        "73CHAPTER 7\nTrade Parameters\nfor Various Market\nConditions\nAfter learning about the emergence of the foreign exchange market, who the\nmajor players are, signiﬁcant historical milestones, and what moves the markets,\nit is time to move on and discuss some of my favorite strategies for trading currencies.\nHowever, before I even begin going over these strategies, the most important ﬁrst\nstep for any trader, regardless of the market that you are trading in, is to create a\ntrading journal.\n■Keep a Trading Journal\nThrough my experience, I have learned that being a successful trader is not about\nﬁnding the holy grail of indicators that can perfectly forecast movements 100% of\nthe time, but instead, to develop discipline. I cannot undermine the importance of\n‘‘the journal’’ as the primary ﬁrst step to becoming a successful and professional\ntrader. While working on the Inter-bank FX trading desk at J.P. Morgan and then\non the Cross-Markets trading desk after the merger with Chase, the trading journal\nmentality was engrained into the minds of every dealer and proprietary trader on the\ntrading ﬂoors, regardless of rank. The reason was simple—the bank was providing\nthe capital for trading and we needed to be held accountable, especially since each\ntransaction involved millions of dollars. For every trade that was executed, we\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS74needed to have a solid rationale as well as justiﬁcation for the choice of entry and exit\nlevels. More speciﬁcally, you had to know where to place your exit points before\nyou placed the trade to approximate worst case losses and to manage risk.\nWith this sort of accountability, the leading banks of the world are able to breed\nsuccessful and professional traders. For individual traders, this practice is even more\nimportant because you are trading with your own money and not someone else’s.\nBank traders are trading with someone else’s money so regardless of how poorly\nthey perform over a one- or two-week basis, they will receive their paycheck twice\na month. At a bank, traders have plenty of time to make the money back without any\ndisruptions to their daily way of life—unless of course they lose $1 million in one\nday. As an individual trader—you do not have this luxury. When you are trading\nwith your own money, each dollar lost is a dollar less that you own. So even though\nyou should only be trading with risk capital, or money that would not otherwise be\nused for rent or groceries, one way or the other, the pain is felt. To avoid repeating\nthe same mistakes and taking large losses, I cannot stress enough the importance of\nkeeping a trading journal. The journal is designed to ensure that as a trader, you\nonly take calculated losses and learn from each mistake. The trading journal setup\nthat I recommend should be broken up into three parts:\n1. Currency pair checklist\n2. Trades that I am waiting for\n3. Existing or completed trades\nCurrency Pair Checklist\nThe ﬁrst section of your trading journal should consist of a spreadsheet that can be\nprinted out and completed every day. This purpose of this checklist is to get a feel\nof the market and to identify trades. It should list of all of the currency pairs that are\noffered for trading on the left column, followed by three columns for the current,\nhigh, and low prices, and then a series of triggers laid out as a row on the right\nhand side. Newer traders should start with following only the four major currency\npairs, which are the EURUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, and the GBPUSD, and then\ngradually add the AUDUSD, USDCAD, and NZDUSD, followed by the nondollar\npairs. Although the checklist that I have created is fairly detailed, I ﬁnd that it is\na very useful daily exercise and should take no more than 20 minutes to complete\nonce the appropriate indicators are saved on the charts. The purpose of this checklist\nis to get a clear visual of which currencies are trending and which are range trading.\nComprehending the big picture is the ﬁrst step to trading successfully. Too often\nhave I seen traders fail because they lose sight of the overall environment that they\nare trading in. The worst thing to do is to trade blindly. Trying to pick tops or\nbottoms in a strong trend or buying breakouts in a range-bound environment can\nlead to signiﬁcant losses. Just take a look at Figure 7.1 of the EURUSD. If you tried\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS75\nFIGURE 7.1 EURUSD Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS76to pick bottoms in this pair, it would have led to an entire year of frustrating and\nunsuccessful trading. In trending environments, traders will ﬁnd a higher success\nrate by buying on retracements in an uptrend or selling on rallies in a downtrend.\nPicking tops and bottoms should only be a strategy that is used in clear range trading\nenvironments and even with that, traders need to be careful of contracting ranges\nthat can lead to breakout scenarios.\nA simpliﬁed version of the daily market overview sheet that I use is shown in\nFigure 7.2.\nAs you can see in Figure 7.2, the ﬁrst two columns after the daily high and low\nprices are the levels of the 10-day high or low. Recording this price helps to identify\nwhere current prices are within previous price action. This helps traders get a gauge\nof whether we are pressing toward a 10-day high or low or if we are simply trapped\nin the middle of the range. Yet the prices alone do not provide enough information\nto determine if we are in a trending or a range-bound environment. The next ﬁve\nindicators is a checklist for determining a trending environment. The more X marks\nin this section, the stronger the trend.\nThe ﬁrst column in the trending indicator group is the ‘‘ADX (14) above 25.’’\nADX is the Accumulation Distribution Index, which is the most popular used\nindicator for determining the strength of a trend. If the index reading is above 25,\nit indicates that a trend has developed. Generally speaking, the greater the number,\nthe stronger the trend. The next column is Bollinger Bands. When strong trends\ndevelop, the pair will frequently tag and cross either the upper or lower Bollinger\nBand. The next three trend indicators are the longer term moving averages. A\nbreak above or below these moving averages may also be indicative of a trending\nenvironment. With moving averages, crossovers in the direction of the trend can be\nused as a further conﬁrmation. If there are two or more Xs in this section, traders\nshould be looking for opportunities to buy on dips in an uptrend or sell on rallies in a\ndowntrend rather than selling at the top and buying back at the bottom of the range.\nThe last section of the trading journal is indications of range. The ﬁrst indicator is\nalso ADX, but this time, we are looking for ADX below 25, which signals that the\ncurrency pair’s trend is weak. Next, we look at the traditional oscillators, RSI and\nstochastics. If the ADX is weak and there is signiﬁcant technical resistance above,\nprovided by indicators such as moving averages or Fibonacci retracement levels,\nand RSI and/or stochastics are at overbought or oversold levels, we identify an\nenvironment that is highly conducive to range trading.\nOf course, the market overview sheet is not foolproof, and just because you have\na lot of X marks in either the trend or range group doesn’t mean that a trend will\nnot fade or a breakout will not occur. Yet, what this spreadsheet will do is prevent\ntraders from trading blindly and ignoring the broader market conditions. It provides\ntraders with a launching pad from which to identify the day’s trading opportunities.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS77Date - Time\nTrending Range\nCurrencyPair Current\nPriceDaily\nHighDaily\nLow10-day\nHigh10-day\nLowBollinger\nBand UpBollinger\nBand Down(14)\nabove 25Crosses\n50-DayCrosses\n100-dayCrosses\n200-dayBollinger\nBand\nRangeADX\n(14)\nbelow\n25RS1 (14)\nGreater\nthan 80(14)\nLess\nthan 80Stochastics\n>70Stochastics\n<30\nEURUSD 1.105 1.1144 1.0923 X X X X\nGBPUSD\nUSDJPY\nUSDCHF\nAUDUSD\nNZDUSD\nUSDCAD\nEURJPY\nEURGBP\nEURCHF\nAUDJPY\nCHFJPY\nGBPJPY\nGBPCHF\nAUDCAD\nEURCAD\nAUDNZD\nFIGURE 7.2 Currency Checklist\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS78Trades That I Am Waiting For\nThe next section in the trading journal lists out the possible trades for the day. Based\non an initial overview of the charts, this section is where you should list the trades\nfor which you are waiting. A sample entry would look like the following:\nApril 5, 2015\nBuy AUDUSD on a break of 0.7850 (previous day high)\nStop at 0.7800 (50-day SMA)\nTarget 1—0.7925 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement of Nov-Mar bull wave)\nTarget 2—0.8075 (Upper Bollinger)\nTarget 3—10-day Trailing Low\nAs soon as your entry level is reached, you know exactly how to take action and\nwhere to place your stops and limits. Of course, it is also important to take a quick\nglance at the market to make sure that the trading conditions that you were waiting\nfor are still intact. For example, if you were looking for a strong breakout with no\nretracement to occur at the entry level, when it does break, you want to make sure\nthat the break has decent momentum. This exercise will help you develop a plan of\naction to approach your trading day. Before every battle, warriors will regroup to\ngo over the plan of attack—in trading, you want to have the same mentality. Plan\nand prepare for the worst-case scenario and know your plan of attack for the day!\nExisting or Completed Trades\nThis section is developed and used to enforce discipline and to learn from your\nmistakes. At the end of each trading day, it is important to review this section to\nunderstand why certain trades resulted in losses and others in proﬁts. The purpose\nof this section is to identify trends. To understand why this is important, let’s look\nat an example that is completely unrelated to trading. On a normal given day,\nmost people will subconsciously inject a lot of ‘‘ums’’ or ‘‘uhs’’ into their daily\nconversation. However, most of these people do not even realize that they are even\ndoing so until someone records their conversation and replays it back to them. This\nis one of the ways that professional presenters and newscasters train to kick the\nhabit of using placeholder words. Having worked with over 65,000 traders, too\noften have I seen these traders make the same mistakes repeatedly. This includes\ntaking proﬁts too early, letting losses run, getting emotional about trading, ignoring\neconomic releases, or entering a trade prematurely. Keeping a record of previous\ntrades is like keeping a recording of your conversations. When you ﬂip back to the\ntrades that you have completed, you may have a perfect map of what strategies have\nor have not been proﬁtable for you. The reason why a journal is so important is\nbecause it minimizes the emotional intervention of trades. I frequently see novice\ntraders take proﬁts early but let losses run. The following are two samples of trade\njournal entries that could have provided learning opportunities:\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS79February 12, 2015\nTrade: Short 3 lots of EURUSD @ 1.1045\nStop: 1.1195 (former all-time high)\nTarget: 1.0800\nResult: Trade closed on Feb 13, 2015—stopped out of the 3 lots @ 1.1195\n(–150 pips)\nComments: Got margin call! It broke the all-time high, I thought it was going\nto reverse, did not stick to stop—kept letting losses run, eventually margin\ncall closed out all positions. Note to self: MAKE SURE STICK TO STOPS!\nApril 3, 2015\nTrade: Long 2 lots of USDCAD @ 1.2135\nStop: 1.2000 (strong technical support—conﬂuence of 50-day moving average\nand 68% Fibonacci retracement of Feb—March rally)\nTarget: First lot @ 1.2295 (upper Bollinger and 5 pips shy of 1.2300 psychological\nresistance)\nSecond lot @ 1.2450 (Former head and shoulders support turned resistance,\n100-day SMA)\nResult: Trade closed on April 5, 2015—stopped out of the 2 lots at 1.2000\n(–135 pips)\nComments: USDCAD did not continue uptrend and was becoming overbought,\nI didn’t see that ADX was weakening and falling from higher levels, there was\nalso a divergence in Stochastics. Note to self: MAKE SURE TO LOOK FOR\nDIVERGENCES NEXT TIME!\nUnlike many traders, the best trades in my opinion are the trades where both\ntechnicals and fundamentals support the trade. In general, I prefer to stay out of\ntrades that contradict my fundamental outlook. For example, if there is a bullish\nformation in both the GBPUSD and the AUDUSD due to U.S. dollar weakness,\nbut the Bank of England has ﬁnished raising interest rates, while the Reserve\nBank of Australia has full intentions of tightening to tame the strength of the\nAustralian economy, I would most likely choose to express my bearish dollar view\nin the AUDUSD rather than the GBPUSD. My bias for choosing the AUDUSD\nover the GBPUSD would be even stronger if the AUDUSD already offered a\nhigher interest rate differential than the GBPUSD. I seen technicals thwarted by\nfundamentals so often that now I always incorporate both into my trading strategy.\nI use a combination of technical, fundamental, and positioning, and am generally\nalso a trend follower. I also typically use a top-down approach that involves the\nfollowing:\n1. I will start by taking an overall technical survey of the market and pick the\ncurrency pairs that have retraced to attractive levels for entry in order to\nparticipate in a medium term fundamentally supportive trend.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS802. For currencies with a dollar component (i.e., not the crosses), I determine if my\ninitial technical view for that pair coincides with my fundamental view on the\ndollar, as well as my view on how upcoming U.S. releases may impact trading\nfor the day. The reason why I look at the dollar speciﬁcally is because 80% of all\ncurrency trades involve the dollar, which makes U.S. fundamentals particularly\nimportant.\n3. If it is a cross, I will proceed by determining if the technical view coincides with\nthe fundamental outlook using Fibonacci retracements, ADX, moving averages,\noscillators, and other technical tools.\n4. Then I like to look at positioning using the Commitment of Traders Report or\nthe FXCM Speculative Sentiment index to see if it supports the trade.\n5. If I am left with two equally compelling trade ideas, I will choose the one with\na positive interest rate differential.\nHave a Toolbox—Use What Works for the Current Market\nEnvironment\nOnce you have created a trading journal, it is time to ﬁgure out which indicators to\nlay on your charts. The reason why a lot of traders fail is because they neglect to\nrealize that their favorite indicators are not foolproof. Buying when stochastics are\nin oversold territory and selling when it is in overbought territory is a strategy that\nis used quite often by range traders, to a great deal of success, but once the market\nstops range trading and begins to trend, then relying on stochastics could lead to\ntremendous amount of losses. In order to become consistently proﬁtable, successful\ntraders need to learn to be adaptable.\nOne of the most important practices that every trader must understand is to be\nconscious of the environment that they are trading in. Every trader needs to have\nsome sort of checklist that will help to classify the trading environment so that\nthey can determine whether the market is trending or range bound. Deﬁning\ntrade parameters is one of the most important disciplines of trading. Too many\ntraders have tried to pick the top within a trend, only to wind up with consistently\nunproﬁtable trades.\nAlthough deﬁning trade parameters is important to traders in any market\n(currencies, futures, equities), it is particularly important in the currency market\nsince over 80% of the volume is speculative in nature. This means that currencies\ncan spend a very long period of time in a certain trading environment. Also, the\ncurrency market obeys technical analysis particularly well, given its large scale and\nnumber of participants.\nThere are basically two types of trading environments, which means that at any\npoint in time an instrument is either range trading or trending. The ﬁrst step every\ntrader needs to take is to deﬁne the current trading environment. The shortest time\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS81frame that traders should start looking at when their trading day starts are daily\ncharts, even if you are trading on a 5-minute time frame.\n■Step #1: Determine the Trading Environment\nRules to Determining Trading Environment\nThere are many different ways that traders can determine whether a currency pair\nis range trading or trending. Of course, many people do it visually, but having set\nrules will help to keep traders out of trends that may be fading or to prevent traders\nfrom getting into a range trade in the midst of a possible breakout. In Figure 7.3, I\nhave outlined some of the rules that I look for in order to classify a currency pair’s\ntrading environment.\nProﬁling a Range Environment\nLook for:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) less than 20 —The Average Directional Index is\none of the primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a\ntrend. When ADX is less than 20, this suggests that the trend is weak, which\nis generally characteristic of range-bound market. If ADX is less than 20 and\ntrending downward, it provides a further conﬁrmation that the trend is not only\nweak but will probably stay in a range-trading environment for a while longer.\n2.Decreasing implied volatility —There are many ways to analyze volatility. What I\nlike to do is actually track short-term versus long-term volatility. When short-\nterm volatility is falling, especially after a burst above long-term volatility, it\nis usually indicative of a reversion to range trading scenarios. Volatility usually\nTrade Rules Indicators\nRange ■ADX<20\n■Decreasing implied volatility\n■Risk reversals near choice or ﬂipping\nbetween favoring calls and putsBollinger, Bands, ADX,\nOptions\nTrend ■ADX>25\n■Momentum consistent with trend\ndirection\n■Risk reversals strongly bid for put or callMoving\naverages, ADX, Options,\nMomentum\nFIGURE 7.3 Trend/Range Trading Rules\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS82blows out when a currency pair experiences sharp, quick moves. It contracts\nwhen ranges are narrow and the trading is very quiet in the markets. The lazy\nman’s version of the way I track volatility is Bollinger Bands, which is actually\nalso a fairly decent measure for determining volatility conditions. A narrow\nBollinger Band suggests that ranges are small and there is low volatility in the\nmarkets, while wide Bollinger Bands are reﬂective of large ranges and a highly\nvolatile environment. In a range-trading environment, we are looking for fairly\nnarrow Bollinger Bands, ideally in a horizontal formation similar to the USDJPY\nchart in Figure 7.4.\n3.Risk reversals ﬂipping between calls and puts : A risk reversal consists of a pair of\noptions, a call and a put, on the same currency. Risk reversals have both the\nsame expiration (1 month) and sensitivity to the underlying spot rate. They are\nquoted in terms of the difference in volatility between the two options. While\nin theory these options should have the same implied volatility in practice, these\nvolatilities often differ in the market. Risk reversals can be seen as having a\nmarket polling function. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates\nthat the market prefers calls over puts. The reverse is true if the number is\nstrongly in favor of puts versus calls. Thus, risk reversals can be used as a\nsubstitute for gauging positions in the FX market. In an ideal environment, far\nout of the money calls and puts should have the same volatility. However, this\nis rarely the case, since there is generally a sentiment bias in the markets that\nis reﬂected in risk reversals. In range-bound environments, risk reversals tend\nFIGURE 7.4 USDJPY Bollinger Band Chart\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS83to ﬂip between favoring calls and puts at nearly zero (or equal). This indicates\nthat there is indecision among bulls and bears, and there is no strong bias in\nthe markets.\nWhat Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nAccording to the risk reversals in Figure 7.5, we can see that the market is strongly\nfavoring yen calls (JC) and dollar puts over the long term. EURUSD short-term\nrisk reversals are near choice, which is what you are looking for when proﬁling a\nrange-bound environment. Risk reversal information used to be readily available\nbut is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd these days. Currently, the only place we know of that\nprovides this information is the Bloomberg Professional Terminal, which costs over\nUS$1500 a month.\nIdentifying a Trending Environment\nLook for three things:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) greater than 20 —As mentioned earlier when we\ntalked about range-trading conditions, the Average Directional Index is one of\nthe primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a trend. In\na trending environment, we look for ADX to be greater than 25 and rising. If\nADX is greater than 25 but sloping downward, especially off of the extreme 40\nlevel, you have to be careful of aggressive trend positioning since it may indicate\nthat the trend is waning.\n2.Momentum consistent with trend direction —In addition to using ADX, I also\nrecommend looking for conﬁrmation of a trending environment through\nmomentum indicators. Traders should look for momentum to be consistent\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nCurrency 1M R/R 3M R/R 6M R/R 1YR R/R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 JC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C=Japanese yen call * SC =Sterling call\n*E C=Euro call * CC =Swiss call\n*S P=Sterling put\nFIGURE 7.5 Risk Reversals\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS84with the direction of the trend. Most currency traders will look for oscillators to\npoint strongly in the direction of the trend. For example, in an uptrend, trend\ntraders will look for the moving averages, RSI, stochastics, and MACD to all\npoint strongly upward. In a downtrend, they will look for these same indicators\nto point downward. Some currency traders use the momentum index, but in\nmy experience, it is less popular and reliable. Instead, one of the strongest\nmomentum indicators is a perfect order of moving averages. A perfect order is\nwhen we have the moving averages line up perfectly: that is, for an uptrend,\nthe 10-day SMA is greater than the 20-day SMA, which is greater 50-day SMA.\nThe 100-day SMA and the 200-day SMA are below the shorter-term moving\naverages. In a downtrend, a perfect order would be when the shorter-term\nmoving averages stack up below the longer-term moving averages.\n3.Options (risk reversals)— With a trending environment, we are looking for risk\nreversals to strongly favor calls or puts. When one side of the market is laden\nwith interest, it is usually indicative of a strong trending environment or that a\ncontra-trend move may be brewing if risk reversals are at extreme levels.\n■Step #2: Determine the Time Frame for Trade\nOnce you have determined that a currency pair is either range-bound or trending,\nit is time to determine how long you plan on holding the trade. The following is a\nset of guidelines and indicators that I use for trading different time frames. Not all\nof the guidelines need to be met, but the more guidelines that are met, the more\nsolid the trading opportunity.\nIntraday Trade (Range)\nRules:\n1. Use hourly charts to determine entry points and daily charts to conﬁrm that a\nrange trade exists on a longer-time frame.\n2. Use oscillators to determine entry point within range.\n3. Look for short-dated risk reversals to be near choice.\n4. Look for reversal in oscillators (RSI or stochastics at extreme point).\n5. Trade stronger when prices fail at key resistance or hold key support levels (use\nFibonacci retracement points and moving averages).\nIndicators Used:\nStochastics, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, options, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS85Medium-Term Range Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. There are two ways to range trade medium term—position for upcoming range\ntrading opportunities or get involved in existing ranges.\n3.Upcoming range opportunities : Look for high-volatility environments, where short-\nterm implied volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than longer-term volatilities.\nSeek reversion back to the mean environments.\n4.Existing ranges : Use Bollinger Bands to identify existing ranges.\n5. Look for reversals in oscillators such as RSI and stochastics.\n6. Make sure ADX is below 25 and ideally falling.\n7. Look for medium-term risk reversals near choice.\n8. Conﬁrm with price action—failure at key range resistances and bounces on key\nrange supports (using traditional technical indicators).\nIndicators:\nOptions, Bollinger Bands, stochastics, MACD, RSI, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nMedium-Term Trend Trade\nRules:\n1. Look for ranges on daily charts and use weekly charts for conﬁrmation.\n2. Refer back to the characteristics of a trending environment—look for those\nparameters to be met.\n3. Buy breakout/retracement scenarios on key Fibonacci levels or moving averages.\n4. Look for no major resistance levels in front of trade.\n5. Look for candlestick pattern conﬁrmation.\n6. Look for moving average conﬂuence to be on same side of trade.\n7. Enter on a break of signiﬁcant high or low.\n8. The ideal is to wait for volatilities to contract before getting in.\n9. Look for fundamentals to also be supportive of trade—growth and interest\nrates. You want to see a string of economic surprises or disappointments\ndepending on directional bias.\nIndicators\nADX, Parabolic SAR, RSI, Ichimoku Clouds, Elliot waves, Fibonacci\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS86Medium-Term Breakout Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. Look for contraction in short-term volatility to a point where it is sharply below\nlong-term volatility.\n3. Use pivot points to determine whether a break is a true break or a false break.\n4. Look for moving average conﬂuences to be supportive of trade.\nIndicators\nBollinger Bands, moving averages, Fibonacci\n■Risk Management\nAlthough risk management is one of the more simple topics to grasp, it is also one\nof the most important. Too often we have seen traders turn winning positions into\nlosing positions and solid strategies result in losses instead of proﬁts. The fact of the\nmatter is that regardless of how intelligent and knowledgeable a trader may be about\nthe markets, their own psychology will cause them to lose money. Why does this\nhappen? Are the markets really so enigmatic that few can proﬁt? Or is there simply\na common mistake that virtually all traders are prone to making? The answer is the\nlatter. And the good news is that the problem, while it can be an emotionally and\npsychologically challenging, is ultimately fairly easy to grasp and solve.\nMost traders lose money simply because they have no understanding or place no\nimportance in risk management . Risk management involves essentially knowing how\nmuch you are willing to risk and how much you are looking to gain. Without a\nsense of risk management, most traders simply hold on to losing positions for an\nextremely long amount of time, but take proﬁts on winning positions prematurely.\nThe result is a seemingly paradoxical scenario that in reality is all too common: The\ntrader ends up having more winning positions than losing ones, but ends up with a\nnegative P/L. So, what can traders do to ensure they have solid risk management\nhabits? There are a few key guidelines that every trader, regardless of their strategy\nor what they are trading, should keep in mind:\n■Risk-reward ratio . Traders should look to establish a risk-reward ratio for every\ntrade they place. In other words, they should have an idea of how much they are\nwilling to lose, and how much they are looking to gain. Generally, the risk-reward\nratio should be at least 1:2, if not more. Having a solid risk-reward ratio can\nprevent traders from entering positions that ultimately are not worth the risk.\n■Stop-loss orders . Traders should also employ stop-loss orders as a way of specifying\nthe maximum loss they are willing to accept. By using stop-loss orders, traders\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS87can avoid the common predicament of being in a scenario where they have many\nwinning trades but a single loss large enough to eliminate any trace of proﬁtability\nin the account. Trailing stops to lock in proﬁts are particularly useful. A good\nhabit of more successful traders is to employ the rule of moving your stop to\nbreak even as soon as your position has proﬁted by the same amount that you\ninitially risked through the stop order. At the same time, some traders may also\nchoose to close a portion of their position.\nFor those looking to add to a winning position or go with trend, the best strategy\nis to treat it as if it were a new trade of its own, independent of the winning position.\nIf you are going to add to a winning position, perform the same analysis of the chart\nthat you would if you had no position at all. If a trade continues to go in your favor,\nyou can also close out part of the position while trailing your stop higher on the\nremaining lots that you are holding. Try thinking about your risk and reward on\neach separate lot that you have bought if they are at different entry points as well. If\nyou buy a second lot 50 pips above your ﬁrst entry point, don’t use the same stop\nprice on both, but manage the risk on the second lot independently from the ﬁrst.\nUsing Stop-Loss Orders to Manage Risk\nGiven the importance of money management to successful trading, using the stop-\nloss order is imperative for any trader looking to succeed in the currency market.\nStop-loss orders allow traders to specify the maximum loss they are willing to\naccept on any given trade. If the market reaches the rate the trader speciﬁes in\nhis/her stop-loss order, then the trade will be closed immediately. As a result, using\nstop-loss orders allows you to know how much you are risking at the time you enter\nthe trade.\nThere are two parts to successfully using a stop-loss order: (1) initially placing\nthe stop at a reasonable level and (2) trailing the stop—or moving it forward toward\nproﬁtability—as the trade progresses in your favor.\nPlacing the Stop Loss\nWe recommend two ways of placing a trailing stop-loss order:\n■The ﬁrst is a two-day low method . These volatility-based stops involve placing your\nstop-loss order approximately 10 to 20 pips below the two-day low of the pair.\nFor example, if the low on the EURUSD’s most recent candle was 1.1200, and\nthe previous candle’s low was 1.1100, then the stop should be placed around\n1.1090—10 pips below the two-day low—if a trader is looking to get long. This\ntype of trailing stop allows you to keep tight control of the position and minimizes\nthe time in trade. The downside is that it can be closed prematurely during a brief\nperiod of consolidation.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS88■Parabolic SAR . Another form of volatility-based stop is the parabolic SAR, an\nindicator that is found on many currency trading charting applications. This\nindicator graphically displays a small dot at the point on the chart where the stop\nshould be placed. The beneﬁt of parabolic SAR is that it is dynamic and generally\nfurther away from the current price.\nThere is no magic formula for what works best in every situation, but the\nfollowing is an example of how these stops could be used.\nUpon entering a long position, determine where support is and place a stop 20\npips below support. For example, let’s say this is 60 pips below the entry point. If\nthe trade earns a proﬁt of 60 pips, close half of my position using a market order,\nthen move the stop up to the entry point. At this point, trail the stop 60 pips behind\nthe moving market price. If the parabolic SAR moves up so that it is above the entry\npoint, you could switch to using parabolic SAR as the stop level. Of course, during\nthe day, there can be other signals that could prompt you to move your stop. If the\nprice breaks through a new resistance level, that resistance then becomes support.\nYou can place a stop 20 pips below that support level, even if it is only 30–40\npips away from the current price. The underlying principle you have to use is to\nﬁnd a point to place your stop where you would no longer want to be in the trade\nonce the price reaches that level. Usually it falls at a point where the price goes\nbelow support.\nAside from employing proper risk management strategies, one of the other\nmore crucial yet overlooked elements of successful trading is maintaining a healthy\npsychological outlook. At the end of the day, a trader who is unable to cope with the\nstress of market ﬂuctuations will not stand the test of time—no matter how skilled\nthey may be at the more scientiﬁc elements of trading. Here are some tips:\n■Practice emotional detachment . That is, traders must make trading decisions based on\nstrategies independent of fear and greed. One of the premiere attributes a good\ntrader has is emotional detachment: While these traders are dedicated and fully\ninvolved in their trades, they are not emotionally married to them; they accept\nlosing, and make their investment decisions on an intellectual level. Traders who\nare emotionally involved in trading often make substantial errors, as they tend\nto whimsically change their strategy after a few losing trades, or become overly\ncarefree after a few winning trades. A good trader must be emotionally balanced,\nand must base all trading decisions on strategy—not fear or greed.\n■Know when to take a break . In the midst of a losing streak, consider taking a break\nfrom trading before fear and greed dominate your strategy.\nNot every trade can be a winning one. As a result, traders must be psycholog-\nically capable of coping with losses. Most traders, even successful ones, will go\nthrough a stretch of losing trades. The key to being a successful trader, though,\nis being able to go through a losing stretch unfazed and undeterred. If you are\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS89experiencing a string of losing trades, it may be time to take a break from trading.\nOften, taking a few days off from watching the market to clear your mind can be\nthe best remedy for a losing streak. Continuing to trade relentlessly during a tough\nmarket condition can breed greater losses and ruin your psychological trading\ncapacity. Ultimately, it’s always better to acknowledge your losses rather than\ncontinue to ﬁght through them and pretend they don’t exist. Make no mistake\nabout it: Regardless of how much you study, practice, or trade, there will be losing\ntrades throughout your entire career. The key is to make them small enough that\nyou can live to trade another day and allow your winning trades room to breathe\nand ﬂourish. You can overcome a lot of bad luck with proper money management\ntechniques. This is why we have stressed a 2:1 reward to risk ratio, and why we\nrecommend not risking more than 2% of your equity on any single trade.\nWhether you are trading forex, equities, or futures, there are 10 trading rules\nthat successful traders should live by:\n1. Limit your losses.\n2. Let your proﬁts run.\n3. Keep position sizes within reason.\n4. Know your risk versus reward ratio.\n5. Be adequately capitalized.\n6. Don’t ﬁght the trend.\n7. Never add to losing positions.\n8. Know market expectations.\n9. Learn from your mistake—keep a trade log.\n10. Have a maximum drawdown.",
        "73CHAPTER 7\nTrade Parameters\nfor Various Market\nConditions\nAfter learning about the emergence of the foreign exchange market, who the\nmajor players are, signiﬁcant historical milestones, and what moves the markets,\nit is time to move on and discuss some of my favorite strategies for trading currencies.\nHowever, before I even begin going over these strategies, the most important ﬁrst\nstep for any trader, regardless of the market that you are trading in, is to create a\ntrading journal.\n■Keep a Trading Journal\nThrough my experience, I have learned that being a successful trader is not about\nﬁnding the holy grail of indicators that can perfectly forecast movements 100% of\nthe time, but instead, to develop discipline. I cannot undermine the importance of\n‘‘the journal’’ as the primary ﬁrst step to becoming a successful and professional\ntrader. While working on the Inter-bank FX trading desk at J.P. Morgan and then\non the Cross-Markets trading desk after the merger with Chase, the trading journal\nmentality was engrained into the minds of every dealer and proprietary trader on the\ntrading ﬂoors, regardless of rank. The reason was simple—the bank was providing\nthe capital for trading and we needed to be held accountable, especially since each\ntransaction involved millions of dollars. For every trade that was executed, we\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS74needed to have a solid rationale as well as justiﬁcation for the choice of entry and exit\nlevels. More speciﬁcally, you had to know where to place your exit points before\nyou placed the trade to approximate worst case losses and to manage risk.\nWith this sort of accountability, the leading banks of the world are able to breed\nsuccessful and professional traders. For individual traders, this practice is even more\nimportant because you are trading with your own money and not someone else’s.\nBank traders are trading with someone else’s money so regardless of how poorly\nthey perform over a one- or two-week basis, they will receive their paycheck twice\na month. At a bank, traders have plenty of time to make the money back without any\ndisruptions to their daily way of life—unless of course they lose $1 million in one\nday. As an individual trader—you do not have this luxury. When you are trading\nwith your own money, each dollar lost is a dollar less that you own. So even though\nyou should only be trading with risk capital, or money that would not otherwise be\nused for rent or groceries, one way or the other, the pain is felt. To avoid repeating\nthe same mistakes and taking large losses, I cannot stress enough the importance of\nkeeping a trading journal. The journal is designed to ensure that as a trader, you\nonly take calculated losses and learn from each mistake. The trading journal setup\nthat I recommend should be broken up into three parts:\n1. Currency pair checklist\n2. Trades that I am waiting for\n3. Existing or completed trades\nCurrency Pair Checklist\nThe ﬁrst section of your trading journal should consist of a spreadsheet that can be\nprinted out and completed every day. This purpose of this checklist is to get a feel\nof the market and to identify trades. It should list of all of the currency pairs that are\noffered for trading on the left column, followed by three columns for the current,\nhigh, and low prices, and then a series of triggers laid out as a row on the right\nhand side. Newer traders should start with following only the four major currency\npairs, which are the EURUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, and the GBPUSD, and then\ngradually add the AUDUSD, USDCAD, and NZDUSD, followed by the nondollar\npairs. Although the checklist that I have created is fairly detailed, I ﬁnd that it is\na very useful daily exercise and should take no more than 20 minutes to complete\nonce the appropriate indicators are saved on the charts. The purpose of this checklist\nis to get a clear visual of which currencies are trending and which are range trading.\nComprehending the big picture is the ﬁrst step to trading successfully. Too often\nhave I seen traders fail because they lose sight of the overall environment that they\nare trading in. The worst thing to do is to trade blindly. Trying to pick tops or\nbottoms in a strong trend or buying breakouts in a range-bound environment can\nlead to signiﬁcant losses. Just take a look at Figure 7.1 of the EURUSD. If you tried\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS75\nFIGURE 7.1 EURUSD Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS76to pick bottoms in this pair, it would have led to an entire year of frustrating and\nunsuccessful trading. In trending environments, traders will ﬁnd a higher success\nrate by buying on retracements in an uptrend or selling on rallies in a downtrend.\nPicking tops and bottoms should only be a strategy that is used in clear range trading\nenvironments and even with that, traders need to be careful of contracting ranges\nthat can lead to breakout scenarios.\nA simpliﬁed version of the daily market overview sheet that I use is shown in\nFigure 7.2.\nAs you can see in Figure 7.2, the ﬁrst two columns after the daily high and low\nprices are the levels of the 10-day high or low. Recording this price helps to identify\nwhere current prices are within previous price action. This helps traders get a gauge\nof whether we are pressing toward a 10-day high or low or if we are simply trapped\nin the middle of the range. Yet the prices alone do not provide enough information\nto determine if we are in a trending or a range-bound environment. The next ﬁve\nindicators is a checklist for determining a trending environment. The more X marks\nin this section, the stronger the trend.\nThe ﬁrst column in the trending indicator group is the ‘‘ADX (14) above 25.’’\nADX is the Accumulation Distribution Index, which is the most popular used\nindicator for determining the strength of a trend. If the index reading is above 25,\nit indicates that a trend has developed. Generally speaking, the greater the number,\nthe stronger the trend. The next column is Bollinger Bands. When strong trends\ndevelop, the pair will frequently tag and cross either the upper or lower Bollinger\nBand. The next three trend indicators are the longer term moving averages. A\nbreak above or below these moving averages may also be indicative of a trending\nenvironment. With moving averages, crossovers in the direction of the trend can be\nused as a further conﬁrmation. If there are two or more Xs in this section, traders\nshould be looking for opportunities to buy on dips in an uptrend or sell on rallies in a\ndowntrend rather than selling at the top and buying back at the bottom of the range.\nThe last section of the trading journal is indications of range. The ﬁrst indicator is\nalso ADX, but this time, we are looking for ADX below 25, which signals that the\ncurrency pair’s trend is weak. Next, we look at the traditional oscillators, RSI and\nstochastics. If the ADX is weak and there is signiﬁcant technical resistance above,\nprovided by indicators such as moving averages or Fibonacci retracement levels,\nand RSI and/or stochastics are at overbought or oversold levels, we identify an\nenvironment that is highly conducive to range trading.\nOf course, the market overview sheet is not foolproof, and just because you have\na lot of X marks in either the trend or range group doesn’t mean that a trend will\nnot fade or a breakout will not occur. Yet, what this spreadsheet will do is prevent\ntraders from trading blindly and ignoring the broader market conditions. It provides\ntraders with a launching pad from which to identify the day’s trading opportunities.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS77Date - Time\nTrending Range\nCurrencyPair Current\nPriceDaily\nHighDaily\nLow10-day\nHigh10-day\nLowBollinger\nBand UpBollinger\nBand Down(14)\nabove 25Crosses\n50-DayCrosses\n100-dayCrosses\n200-dayBollinger\nBand\nRangeADX\n(14)\nbelow\n25RS1 (14)\nGreater\nthan 80(14)\nLess\nthan 80Stochastics\n>70Stochastics\n<30\nEURUSD 1.105 1.1144 1.0923 X X X X\nGBPUSD\nUSDJPY\nUSDCHF\nAUDUSD\nNZDUSD\nUSDCAD\nEURJPY\nEURGBP\nEURCHF\nAUDJPY\nCHFJPY\nGBPJPY\nGBPCHF\nAUDCAD\nEURCAD\nAUDNZD\nFIGURE 7.2 Currency Checklist\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS78Trades That I Am Waiting For\nThe next section in the trading journal lists out the possible trades for the day. Based\non an initial overview of the charts, this section is where you should list the trades\nfor which you are waiting. A sample entry would look like the following:\nApril 5, 2015\nBuy AUDUSD on a break of 0.7850 (previous day high)\nStop at 0.7800 (50-day SMA)\nTarget 1—0.7925 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement of Nov-Mar bull wave)\nTarget 2—0.8075 (Upper Bollinger)\nTarget 3—10-day Trailing Low\nAs soon as your entry level is reached, you know exactly how to take action and\nwhere to place your stops and limits. Of course, it is also important to take a quick\nglance at the market to make sure that the trading conditions that you were waiting\nfor are still intact. For example, if you were looking for a strong breakout with no\nretracement to occur at the entry level, when it does break, you want to make sure\nthat the break has decent momentum. This exercise will help you develop a plan of\naction to approach your trading day. Before every battle, warriors will regroup to\ngo over the plan of attack—in trading, you want to have the same mentality. Plan\nand prepare for the worst-case scenario and know your plan of attack for the day!\nExisting or Completed Trades\nThis section is developed and used to enforce discipline and to learn from your\nmistakes. At the end of each trading day, it is important to review this section to\nunderstand why certain trades resulted in losses and others in proﬁts. The purpose\nof this section is to identify trends. To understand why this is important, let’s look\nat an example that is completely unrelated to trading. On a normal given day,\nmost people will subconsciously inject a lot of ‘‘ums’’ or ‘‘uhs’’ into their daily\nconversation. However, most of these people do not even realize that they are even\ndoing so until someone records their conversation and replays it back to them. This\nis one of the ways that professional presenters and newscasters train to kick the\nhabit of using placeholder words. Having worked with over 65,000 traders, too\noften have I seen these traders make the same mistakes repeatedly. This includes\ntaking proﬁts too early, letting losses run, getting emotional about trading, ignoring\neconomic releases, or entering a trade prematurely. Keeping a record of previous\ntrades is like keeping a recording of your conversations. When you ﬂip back to the\ntrades that you have completed, you may have a perfect map of what strategies have\nor have not been proﬁtable for you. The reason why a journal is so important is\nbecause it minimizes the emotional intervention of trades. I frequently see novice\ntraders take proﬁts early but let losses run. The following are two samples of trade\njournal entries that could have provided learning opportunities:\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS79February 12, 2015\nTrade: Short 3 lots of EURUSD @ 1.1045\nStop: 1.1195 (former all-time high)\nTarget: 1.0800\nResult: Trade closed on Feb 13, 2015—stopped out of the 3 lots @ 1.1195\n(–150 pips)\nComments: Got margin call! It broke the all-time high, I thought it was going\nto reverse, did not stick to stop—kept letting losses run, eventually margin\ncall closed out all positions. Note to self: MAKE SURE STICK TO STOPS!\nApril 3, 2015\nTrade: Long 2 lots of USDCAD @ 1.2135\nStop: 1.2000 (strong technical support—conﬂuence of 50-day moving average\nand 68% Fibonacci retracement of Feb—March rally)\nTarget: First lot @ 1.2295 (upper Bollinger and 5 pips shy of 1.2300 psychological\nresistance)\nSecond lot @ 1.2450 (Former head and shoulders support turned resistance,\n100-day SMA)\nResult: Trade closed on April 5, 2015—stopped out of the 2 lots at 1.2000\n(–135 pips)\nComments: USDCAD did not continue uptrend and was becoming overbought,\nI didn’t see that ADX was weakening and falling from higher levels, there was\nalso a divergence in Stochastics. Note to self: MAKE SURE TO LOOK FOR\nDIVERGENCES NEXT TIME!\nUnlike many traders, the best trades in my opinion are the trades where both\ntechnicals and fundamentals support the trade. In general, I prefer to stay out of\ntrades that contradict my fundamental outlook. For example, if there is a bullish\nformation in both the GBPUSD and the AUDUSD due to U.S. dollar weakness,\nbut the Bank of England has ﬁnished raising interest rates, while the Reserve\nBank of Australia has full intentions of tightening to tame the strength of the\nAustralian economy, I would most likely choose to express my bearish dollar view\nin the AUDUSD rather than the GBPUSD. My bias for choosing the AUDUSD\nover the GBPUSD would be even stronger if the AUDUSD already offered a\nhigher interest rate differential than the GBPUSD. I seen technicals thwarted by\nfundamentals so often that now I always incorporate both into my trading strategy.\nI use a combination of technical, fundamental, and positioning, and am generally\nalso a trend follower. I also typically use a top-down approach that involves the\nfollowing:\n1. I will start by taking an overall technical survey of the market and pick the\ncurrency pairs that have retraced to attractive levels for entry in order to\nparticipate in a medium term fundamentally supportive trend.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS802. For currencies with a dollar component (i.e., not the crosses), I determine if my\ninitial technical view for that pair coincides with my fundamental view on the\ndollar, as well as my view on how upcoming U.S. releases may impact trading\nfor the day. The reason why I look at the dollar speciﬁcally is because 80% of all\ncurrency trades involve the dollar, which makes U.S. fundamentals particularly\nimportant.\n3. If it is a cross, I will proceed by determining if the technical view coincides with\nthe fundamental outlook using Fibonacci retracements, ADX, moving averages,\noscillators, and other technical tools.\n4. Then I like to look at positioning using the Commitment of Traders Report or\nthe FXCM Speculative Sentiment index to see if it supports the trade.\n5. If I am left with two equally compelling trade ideas, I will choose the one with\na positive interest rate differential.\nHave a Toolbox—Use What Works for the Current Market\nEnvironment\nOnce you have created a trading journal, it is time to ﬁgure out which indicators to\nlay on your charts. The reason why a lot of traders fail is because they neglect to\nrealize that their favorite indicators are not foolproof. Buying when stochastics are\nin oversold territory and selling when it is in overbought territory is a strategy that\nis used quite often by range traders, to a great deal of success, but once the market\nstops range trading and begins to trend, then relying on stochastics could lead to\ntremendous amount of losses. In order to become consistently proﬁtable, successful\ntraders need to learn to be adaptable.\nOne of the most important practices that every trader must understand is to be\nconscious of the environment that they are trading in. Every trader needs to have\nsome sort of checklist that will help to classify the trading environment so that\nthey can determine whether the market is trending or range bound. Deﬁning\ntrade parameters is one of the most important disciplines of trading. Too many\ntraders have tried to pick the top within a trend, only to wind up with consistently\nunproﬁtable trades.\nAlthough deﬁning trade parameters is important to traders in any market\n(currencies, futures, equities), it is particularly important in the currency market\nsince over 80% of the volume is speculative in nature. This means that currencies\ncan spend a very long period of time in a certain trading environment. Also, the\ncurrency market obeys technical analysis particularly well, given its large scale and\nnumber of participants.\nThere are basically two types of trading environments, which means that at any\npoint in time an instrument is either range trading or trending. The ﬁrst step every\ntrader needs to take is to deﬁne the current trading environment. The shortest time\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS81frame that traders should start looking at when their trading day starts are daily\ncharts, even if you are trading on a 5-minute time frame.\n■Step #1: Determine the Trading Environment\nRules to Determining Trading Environment\nThere are many different ways that traders can determine whether a currency pair\nis range trading or trending. Of course, many people do it visually, but having set\nrules will help to keep traders out of trends that may be fading or to prevent traders\nfrom getting into a range trade in the midst of a possible breakout. In Figure 7.3, I\nhave outlined some of the rules that I look for in order to classify a currency pair’s\ntrading environment.\nProﬁling a Range Environment\nLook for:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) less than 20 —The Average Directional Index is\none of the primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a\ntrend. When ADX is less than 20, this suggests that the trend is weak, which\nis generally characteristic of range-bound market. If ADX is less than 20 and\ntrending downward, it provides a further conﬁrmation that the trend is not only\nweak but will probably stay in a range-trading environment for a while longer.\n2.Decreasing implied volatility —There are many ways to analyze volatility. What I\nlike to do is actually track short-term versus long-term volatility. When short-\nterm volatility is falling, especially after a burst above long-term volatility, it\nis usually indicative of a reversion to range trading scenarios. Volatility usually\nTrade Rules Indicators\nRange ■ADX<20\n■Decreasing implied volatility\n■Risk reversals near choice or ﬂipping\nbetween favoring calls and putsBollinger, Bands, ADX,\nOptions\nTrend ■ADX>25\n■Momentum consistent with trend\ndirection\n■Risk reversals strongly bid for put or callMoving\naverages, ADX, Options,\nMomentum\nFIGURE 7.3 Trend/Range Trading Rules\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS82blows out when a currency pair experiences sharp, quick moves. It contracts\nwhen ranges are narrow and the trading is very quiet in the markets. The lazy\nman’s version of the way I track volatility is Bollinger Bands, which is actually\nalso a fairly decent measure for determining volatility conditions. A narrow\nBollinger Band suggests that ranges are small and there is low volatility in the\nmarkets, while wide Bollinger Bands are reﬂective of large ranges and a highly\nvolatile environment. In a range-trading environment, we are looking for fairly\nnarrow Bollinger Bands, ideally in a horizontal formation similar to the USDJPY\nchart in Figure 7.4.\n3.Risk reversals ﬂipping between calls and puts : A risk reversal consists of a pair of\noptions, a call and a put, on the same currency. Risk reversals have both the\nsame expiration (1 month) and sensitivity to the underlying spot rate. They are\nquoted in terms of the difference in volatility between the two options. While\nin theory these options should have the same implied volatility in practice, these\nvolatilities often differ in the market. Risk reversals can be seen as having a\nmarket polling function. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates\nthat the market prefers calls over puts. The reverse is true if the number is\nstrongly in favor of puts versus calls. Thus, risk reversals can be used as a\nsubstitute for gauging positions in the FX market. In an ideal environment, far\nout of the money calls and puts should have the same volatility. However, this\nis rarely the case, since there is generally a sentiment bias in the markets that\nis reﬂected in risk reversals. In range-bound environments, risk reversals tend\nFIGURE 7.4 USDJPY Bollinger Band Chart\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS83to ﬂip between favoring calls and puts at nearly zero (or equal). This indicates\nthat there is indecision among bulls and bears, and there is no strong bias in\nthe markets.\nWhat Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nAccording to the risk reversals in Figure 7.5, we can see that the market is strongly\nfavoring yen calls (JC) and dollar puts over the long term. EURUSD short-term\nrisk reversals are near choice, which is what you are looking for when proﬁling a\nrange-bound environment. Risk reversal information used to be readily available\nbut is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd these days. Currently, the only place we know of that\nprovides this information is the Bloomberg Professional Terminal, which costs over\nUS$1500 a month.\nIdentifying a Trending Environment\nLook for three things:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) greater than 20 —As mentioned earlier when we\ntalked about range-trading conditions, the Average Directional Index is one of\nthe primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a trend. In\na trending environment, we look for ADX to be greater than 25 and rising. If\nADX is greater than 25 but sloping downward, especially off of the extreme 40\nlevel, you have to be careful of aggressive trend positioning since it may indicate\nthat the trend is waning.\n2.Momentum consistent with trend direction —In addition to using ADX, I also\nrecommend looking for conﬁrmation of a trending environment through\nmomentum indicators. Traders should look for momentum to be consistent\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nCurrency 1M R/R 3M R/R 6M R/R 1YR R/R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 JC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C=Japanese yen call * SC =Sterling call\n*E C=Euro call * CC =Swiss call\n*S P=Sterling put\nFIGURE 7.5 Risk Reversals\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS84with the direction of the trend. Most currency traders will look for oscillators to\npoint strongly in the direction of the trend. For example, in an uptrend, trend\ntraders will look for the moving averages, RSI, stochastics, and MACD to all\npoint strongly upward. In a downtrend, they will look for these same indicators\nto point downward. Some currency traders use the momentum index, but in\nmy experience, it is less popular and reliable. Instead, one of the strongest\nmomentum indicators is a perfect order of moving averages. A perfect order is\nwhen we have the moving averages line up perfectly: that is, for an uptrend,\nthe 10-day SMA is greater than the 20-day SMA, which is greater 50-day SMA.\nThe 100-day SMA and the 200-day SMA are below the shorter-term moving\naverages. In a downtrend, a perfect order would be when the shorter-term\nmoving averages stack up below the longer-term moving averages.\n3.Options (risk reversals)— With a trending environment, we are looking for risk\nreversals to strongly favor calls or puts. When one side of the market is laden\nwith interest, it is usually indicative of a strong trending environment or that a\ncontra-trend move may be brewing if risk reversals are at extreme levels.\n■Step #2: Determine the Time Frame for Trade\nOnce you have determined that a currency pair is either range-bound or trending,\nit is time to determine how long you plan on holding the trade. The following is a\nset of guidelines and indicators that I use for trading different time frames. Not all\nof the guidelines need to be met, but the more guidelines that are met, the more\nsolid the trading opportunity.\nIntraday Trade (Range)\nRules:\n1. Use hourly charts to determine entry points and daily charts to conﬁrm that a\nrange trade exists on a longer-time frame.\n2. Use oscillators to determine entry point within range.\n3. Look for short-dated risk reversals to be near choice.\n4. Look for reversal in oscillators (RSI or stochastics at extreme point).\n5. Trade stronger when prices fail at key resistance or hold key support levels (use\nFibonacci retracement points and moving averages).\nIndicators Used:\nStochastics, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, options, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS85Medium-Term Range Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. There are two ways to range trade medium term—position for upcoming range\ntrading opportunities or get involved in existing ranges.\n3.Upcoming range opportunities : Look for high-volatility environments, where short-\nterm implied volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than longer-term volatilities.\nSeek reversion back to the mean environments.\n4.Existing ranges : Use Bollinger Bands to identify existing ranges.\n5. Look for reversals in oscillators such as RSI and stochastics.\n6. Make sure ADX is below 25 and ideally falling.\n7. Look for medium-term risk reversals near choice.\n8. Conﬁrm with price action—failure at key range resistances and bounces on key\nrange supports (using traditional technical indicators).\nIndicators:\nOptions, Bollinger Bands, stochastics, MACD, RSI, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nMedium-Term Trend Trade\nRules:\n1. Look for ranges on daily charts and use weekly charts for conﬁrmation.\n2. Refer back to the characteristics of a trending environment—look for those\nparameters to be met.\n3. Buy breakout/retracement scenarios on key Fibonacci levels or moving averages.\n4. Look for no major resistance levels in front of trade.\n5. Look for candlestick pattern conﬁrmation.\n6. Look for moving average conﬂuence to be on same side of trade.\n7. Enter on a break of signiﬁcant high or low.\n8. The ideal is to wait for volatilities to contract before getting in.\n9. Look for fundamentals to also be supportive of trade—growth and interest\nrates. You want to see a string of economic surprises or disappointments\ndepending on directional bias.\nIndicators\nADX, Parabolic SAR, RSI, Ichimoku Clouds, Elliot waves, Fibonacci\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS86Medium-Term Breakout Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. Look for contraction in short-term volatility to a point where it is sharply below\nlong-term volatility.\n3. Use pivot points to determine whether a break is a true break or a false break.\n4. Look for moving average conﬂuences to be supportive of trade.\nIndicators\nBollinger Bands, moving averages, Fibonacci\n■Risk Management\nAlthough risk management is one of the more simple topics to grasp, it is also one\nof the most important. Too often we have seen traders turn winning positions into\nlosing positions and solid strategies result in losses instead of proﬁts. The fact of the\nmatter is that regardless of how intelligent and knowledgeable a trader may be about\nthe markets, their own psychology will cause them to lose money. Why does this\nhappen? Are the markets really so enigmatic that few can proﬁt? Or is there simply\na common mistake that virtually all traders are prone to making? The answer is the\nlatter. And the good news is that the problem, while it can be an emotionally and\npsychologically challenging, is ultimately fairly easy to grasp and solve.\nMost traders lose money simply because they have no understanding or place no\nimportance in risk management . Risk management involves essentially knowing how\nmuch you are willing to risk and how much you are looking to gain. Without a\nsense of risk management, most traders simply hold on to losing positions for an\nextremely long amount of time, but take proﬁts on winning positions prematurely.\nThe result is a seemingly paradoxical scenario that in reality is all too common: The\ntrader ends up having more winning positions than losing ones, but ends up with a\nnegative P/L. So, what can traders do to ensure they have solid risk management\nhabits? There are a few key guidelines that every trader, regardless of their strategy\nor what they are trading, should keep in mind:\n■Risk-reward ratio . Traders should look to establish a risk-reward ratio for every\ntrade they place. In other words, they should have an idea of how much they are\nwilling to lose, and how much they are looking to gain. Generally, the risk-reward\nratio should be at least 1:2, if not more. Having a solid risk-reward ratio can\nprevent traders from entering positions that ultimately are not worth the risk.\n■Stop-loss orders . Traders should also employ stop-loss orders as a way of specifying\nthe maximum loss they are willing to accept. By using stop-loss orders, traders\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS87can avoid the common predicament of being in a scenario where they have many\nwinning trades but a single loss large enough to eliminate any trace of proﬁtability\nin the account. Trailing stops to lock in proﬁts are particularly useful. A good\nhabit of more successful traders is to employ the rule of moving your stop to\nbreak even as soon as your position has proﬁted by the same amount that you\ninitially risked through the stop order. At the same time, some traders may also\nchoose to close a portion of their position.\nFor those looking to add to a winning position or go with trend, the best strategy\nis to treat it as if it were a new trade of its own, independent of the winning position.\nIf you are going to add to a winning position, perform the same analysis of the chart\nthat you would if you had no position at all. If a trade continues to go in your favor,\nyou can also close out part of the position while trailing your stop higher on the\nremaining lots that you are holding. Try thinking about your risk and reward on\neach separate lot that you have bought if they are at different entry points as well. If\nyou buy a second lot 50 pips above your ﬁrst entry point, don’t use the same stop\nprice on both, but manage the risk on the second lot independently from the ﬁrst.\nUsing Stop-Loss Orders to Manage Risk\nGiven the importance of money management to successful trading, using the stop-\nloss order is imperative for any trader looking to succeed in the currency market.\nStop-loss orders allow traders to specify the maximum loss they are willing to\naccept on any given trade. If the market reaches the rate the trader speciﬁes in\nhis/her stop-loss order, then the trade will be closed immediately. As a result, using\nstop-loss orders allows you to know how much you are risking at the time you enter\nthe trade.\nThere are two parts to successfully using a stop-loss order: (1) initially placing\nthe stop at a reasonable level and (2) trailing the stop—or moving it forward toward\nproﬁtability—as the trade progresses in your favor.\nPlacing the Stop Loss\nWe recommend two ways of placing a trailing stop-loss order:\n■The ﬁrst is a two-day low method . These volatility-based stops involve placing your\nstop-loss order approximately 10 to 20 pips below the two-day low of the pair.\nFor example, if the low on the EURUSD’s most recent candle was 1.1200, and\nthe previous candle’s low was 1.1100, then the stop should be placed around\n1.1090—10 pips below the two-day low—if a trader is looking to get long. This\ntype of trailing stop allows you to keep tight control of the position and minimizes\nthe time in trade. The downside is that it can be closed prematurely during a brief\nperiod of consolidation.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS88■Parabolic SAR . Another form of volatility-based stop is the parabolic SAR, an\nindicator that is found on many currency trading charting applications. This\nindicator graphically displays a small dot at the point on the chart where the stop\nshould be placed. The beneﬁt of parabolic SAR is that it is dynamic and generally\nfurther away from the current price.\nThere is no magic formula for what works best in every situation, but the\nfollowing is an example of how these stops could be used.\nUpon entering a long position, determine where support is and place a stop 20\npips below support. For example, let’s say this is 60 pips below the entry point. If\nthe trade earns a proﬁt of 60 pips, close half of my position using a market order,\nthen move the stop up to the entry point. At this point, trail the stop 60 pips behind\nthe moving market price. If the parabolic SAR moves up so that it is above the entry\npoint, you could switch to using parabolic SAR as the stop level. Of course, during\nthe day, there can be other signals that could prompt you to move your stop. If the\nprice breaks through a new resistance level, that resistance then becomes support.\nYou can place a stop 20 pips below that support level, even if it is only 30–40\npips away from the current price. The underlying principle you have to use is to\nﬁnd a point to place your stop where you would no longer want to be in the trade\nonce the price reaches that level. Usually it falls at a point where the price goes\nbelow support.\nAside from employing proper risk management strategies, one of the other\nmore crucial yet overlooked elements of successful trading is maintaining a healthy\npsychological outlook. At the end of the day, a trader who is unable to cope with the\nstress of market ﬂuctuations will not stand the test of time—no matter how skilled\nthey may be at the more scientiﬁc elements of trading. Here are some tips:\n■Practice emotional detachment . That is, traders must make trading decisions based on\nstrategies independent of fear and greed. One of the premiere attributes a good\ntrader has is emotional detachment: While these traders are dedicated and fully\ninvolved in their trades, they are not emotionally married to them; they accept\nlosing, and make their investment decisions on an intellectual level. Traders who\nare emotionally involved in trading often make substantial errors, as they tend\nto whimsically change their strategy after a few losing trades, or become overly\ncarefree after a few winning trades. A good trader must be emotionally balanced,\nand must base all trading decisions on strategy—not fear or greed.\n■Know when to take a break . In the midst of a losing streak, consider taking a break\nfrom trading before fear and greed dominate your strategy.\nNot every trade can be a winning one. As a result, traders must be psycholog-\nically capable of coping with losses. Most traders, even successful ones, will go\nthrough a stretch of losing trades. The key to being a successful trader, though,\nis being able to go through a losing stretch unfazed and undeterred. If you are\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS89experiencing a string of losing trades, it may be time to take a break from trading.\nOften, taking a few days off from watching the market to clear your mind can be\nthe best remedy for a losing streak. Continuing to trade relentlessly during a tough\nmarket condition can breed greater losses and ruin your psychological trading\ncapacity. Ultimately, it’s always better to acknowledge your losses rather than\ncontinue to ﬁght through them and pretend they don’t exist. Make no mistake\nabout it: Regardless of how much you study, practice, or trade, there will be losing\ntrades throughout your entire career. The key is to make them small enough that\nyou can live to trade another day and allow your winning trades room to breathe\nand ﬂourish. You can overcome a lot of bad luck with proper money management\ntechniques. This is why we have stressed a 2:1 reward to risk ratio, and why we\nrecommend not risking more than 2% of your equity on any single trade.\nWhether you are trading forex, equities, or futures, there are 10 trading rules\nthat successful traders should live by:\n1. Limit your losses.\n2. Let your proﬁts run.\n3. Keep position sizes within reason.\n4. Know your risk versus reward ratio.\n5. Be adequately capitalized.\n6. Don’t ﬁght the trend.\n7. Never add to losing positions.\n8. Know market expectations.\n9. Learn from your mistake—keep a trade log.\n10. Have a maximum drawdown."

        "73CHAPTER 7\nTrade Parameters\nfor Various Market\nConditions\nAfter learning about the emergence of the foreign exchange market, who the\nmajor players are, signiﬁcant historical milestones, and what moves the markets,\nit is time to move on and discuss some of my favorite strategies for trading currencies.\nHowever, before I even begin going over these strategies, the most important ﬁrst\nstep for any trader, regardless of the market that you are trading in, is to create a\ntrading journal.\n■Keep a Trading Journal\nThrough my experience, I have learned that being a successful trader is not about\nﬁnding the holy grail of indicators that can perfectly forecast movements 100% of\nthe time, but instead, to develop discipline. I cannot undermine the importance of\n‘‘the journal’’ as the primary ﬁrst step to becoming a successful and professional\ntrader. While working on the Inter-bank FX trading desk at J.P. Morgan and then\non the Cross-Markets trading desk after the merger with Chase, the trading journal\nmentality was engrained into the minds of every dealer and proprietary trader on the\ntrading ﬂoors, regardless of rank. The reason was simple—the bank was providing\nthe capital for trading and we needed to be held accountable, especially since each\ntransaction involved millions of dollars. For every trade that was executed, we\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS74needed to have a solid rationale as well as justiﬁcation for the choice of entry and exit\nlevels. More speciﬁcally, you had to know where to place your exit points before\nyou placed the trade to approximate worst case losses and to manage risk.\nWith this sort of accountability, the leading banks of the world are able to breed\nsuccessful and professional traders. For individual traders, this practice is even more\nimportant because you are trading with your own money and not someone else’s.\nBank traders are trading with someone else’s money so regardless of how poorly\nthey perform over a one- or two-week basis, they will receive their paycheck twice\na month. At a bank, traders have plenty of time to make the money back without any\ndisruptions to their daily way of life—unless of course they lose $1 million in one\nday. As an individual trader—you do not have this luxury. When you are trading\nwith your own money, each dollar lost is a dollar less that you own. So even though\nyou should only be trading with risk capital, or money that would not otherwise be\nused for rent or groceries, one way or the other, the pain is felt. To avoid repeating\nthe same mistakes and taking large losses, I cannot stress enough the importance of\nkeeping a trading journal. The journal is designed to ensure that as a trader, you\nonly take calculated losses and learn from each mistake. The trading journal setup\nthat I recommend should be broken up into three parts:\n1. Currency pair checklist\n2. Trades that I am waiting for\n3. Existing or completed trades\nCurrency Pair Checklist\nThe ﬁrst section of your trading journal should consist of a spreadsheet that can be\nprinted out and completed every day. This purpose of this checklist is to get a feel\nof the market and to identify trades. It should list of all of the currency pairs that are\noffered for trading on the left column, followed by three columns for the current,\nhigh, and low prices, and then a series of triggers laid out as a row on the right\nhand side. Newer traders should start with following only the four major currency\npairs, which are the EURUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, and the GBPUSD, and then\ngradually add the AUDUSD, USDCAD, and NZDUSD, followed by the nondollar\npairs. Although the checklist that I have created is fairly detailed, I ﬁnd that it is\na very useful daily exercise and should take no more than 20 minutes to complete\nonce the appropriate indicators are saved on the charts. The purpose of this checklist\nis to get a clear visual of which currencies are trending and which are range trading.\nComprehending the big picture is the ﬁrst step to trading successfully. Too often\nhave I seen traders fail because they lose sight of the overall environment that they\nare trading in. The worst thing to do is to trade blindly. Trying to pick tops or\nbottoms in a strong trend or buying breakouts in a range-bound environment can\nlead to signiﬁcant losses. Just take a look at Figure 7.1 of the EURUSD. If you tried\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS75\nFIGURE 7.1 EURUSD Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS76to pick bottoms in this pair, it would have led to an entire year of frustrating and\nunsuccessful trading. In trending environments, traders will ﬁnd a higher success\nrate by buying on retracements in an uptrend or selling on rallies in a downtrend.\nPicking tops and bottoms should only be a strategy that is used in clear range trading\nenvironments and even with that, traders need to be careful of contracting ranges\nthat can lead to breakout scenarios.\nA simpliﬁed version of the daily market overview sheet that I use is shown in\nFigure 7.2.\nAs you can see in Figure 7.2, the ﬁrst two columns after the daily high and low\nprices are the levels of the 10-day high or low. Recording this price helps to identify\nwhere current prices are within previous price action. This helps traders get a gauge\nof whether we are pressing toward a 10-day high or low or if we are simply trapped\nin the middle of the range. Yet the prices alone do not provide enough information\nto determine if we are in a trending or a range-bound environment. The next ﬁve\nindicators is a checklist for determining a trending environment. The more X marks\nin this section, the stronger the trend.\nThe ﬁrst column in the trending indicator group is the ‘‘ADX (14) above 25.’’\nADX is the Accumulation Distribution Index, which is the most popular used\nindicator for determining the strength of a trend. If the index reading is above 25,\nit indicates that a trend has developed. Generally speaking, the greater the number,\nthe stronger the trend. The next column is Bollinger Bands. When strong trends\ndevelop, the pair will frequently tag and cross either the upper or lower Bollinger\nBand. The next three trend indicators are the longer term moving averages. A\nbreak above or below these moving averages may also be indicative of a trending\nenvironment. With moving averages, crossovers in the direction of the trend can be\nused as a further conﬁrmation. If there are two or more Xs in this section, traders\nshould be looking for opportunities to buy on dips in an uptrend or sell on rallies in a\ndowntrend rather than selling at the top and buying back at the bottom of the range.\nThe last section of the trading journal is indications of range. The ﬁrst indicator is\nalso ADX, but this time, we are looking for ADX below 25, which signals that the\ncurrency pair’s trend is weak. Next, we look at the traditional oscillators, RSI and\nstochastics. If the ADX is weak and there is signiﬁcant technical resistance above,\nprovided by indicators such as moving averages or Fibonacci retracement levels,\nand RSI and/or stochastics are at overbought or oversold levels, we identify an\nenvironment that is highly conducive to range trading.\nOf course, the market overview sheet is not foolproof, and just because you have\na lot of X marks in either the trend or range group doesn’t mean that a trend will\nnot fade or a breakout will not occur. Yet, what this spreadsheet will do is prevent\ntraders from trading blindly and ignoring the broader market conditions. It provides\ntraders with a launching pad from which to identify the day’s trading opportunities.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS77Date - Time\nTrending Range\nCurrencyPair Current\nPriceDaily\nHighDaily\nLow10-day\nHigh10-day\nLowBollinger\nBand UpBollinger\nBand Down(14)\nabove 25Crosses\n50-DayCrosses\n100-dayCrosses\n200-dayBollinger\nBand\nRangeADX\n(14)\nbelow\n25RS1 (14)\nGreater\nthan 80(14)\nLess\nthan 80Stochastics\n>70Stochastics\n<30\nEURUSD 1.105 1.1144 1.0923 X X X X\nGBPUSD\nUSDJPY\nUSDCHF\nAUDUSD\nNZDUSD\nUSDCAD\nEURJPY\nEURGBP\nEURCHF\nAUDJPY\nCHFJPY\nGBPJPY\nGBPCHF\nAUDCAD\nEURCAD\nAUDNZD\nFIGURE 7.2 Currency Checklist\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS78Trades That I Am Waiting For\nThe next section in the trading journal lists out the possible trades for the day. Based\non an initial overview of the charts, this section is where you should list the trades\nfor which you are waiting. A sample entry would look like the following:\nApril 5, 2015\nBuy AUDUSD on a break of 0.7850 (previous day high)\nStop at 0.7800 (50-day SMA)\nTarget 1—0.7925 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement of Nov-Mar bull wave)\nTarget 2—0.8075 (Upper Bollinger)\nTarget 3—10-day Trailing Low\nAs soon as your entry level is reached, you know exactly how to take action and\nwhere to place your stops and limits. Of course, it is also important to take a quick\nglance at the market to make sure that the trading conditions that you were waiting\nfor are still intact. For example, if you were looking for a strong breakout with no\nretracement to occur at the entry level, when it does break, you want to make sure\nthat the break has decent momentum. This exercise will help you develop a plan of\naction to approach your trading day. Before every battle, warriors will regroup to\ngo over the plan of attack—in trading, you want to have the same mentality. Plan\nand prepare for the worst-case scenario and know your plan of attack for the day!\nExisting or Completed Trades\nThis section is developed and used to enforce discipline and to learn from your\nmistakes. At the end of each trading day, it is important to review this section to\nunderstand why certain trades resulted in losses and others in proﬁts. The purpose\nof this section is to identify trends. To understand why this is important, let’s look\nat an example that is completely unrelated to trading. On a normal given day,\nmost people will subconsciously inject a lot of ‘‘ums’’ or ‘‘uhs’’ into their daily\nconversation. However, most of these people do not even realize that they are even\ndoing so until someone records their conversation and replays it back to them. This\nis one of the ways that professional presenters and newscasters train to kick the\nhabit of using placeholder words. Having worked with over 65,000 traders, too\noften have I seen these traders make the same mistakes repeatedly. This includes\ntaking proﬁts too early, letting losses run, getting emotional about trading, ignoring\neconomic releases, or entering a trade prematurely. Keeping a record of previous\ntrades is like keeping a recording of your conversations. When you ﬂip back to the\ntrades that you have completed, you may have a perfect map of what strategies have\nor have not been proﬁtable for you. The reason why a journal is so important is\nbecause it minimizes the emotional intervention of trades. I frequently see novice\ntraders take proﬁts early but let losses run. The following are two samples of trade\njournal entries that could have provided learning opportunities:\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS79February 12, 2015\nTrade: Short 3 lots of EURUSD @ 1.1045\nStop: 1.1195 (former all-time high)\nTarget: 1.0800\nResult: Trade closed on Feb 13, 2015—stopped out of the 3 lots @ 1.1195\n(–150 pips)\nComments: Got margin call! It broke the all-time high, I thought it was going\nto reverse, did not stick to stop—kept letting losses run, eventually margin\ncall closed out all positions.

Note to self: MAKE SURE TO LOOK FOR\nDIVERGENCES NEXT TIME!\nUnlike many traders, the best trades in my opinion are the trades where both\ntechnicals and fundamentals support the trade. In general, I prefer to stay out of\ntrades that contradict my fundamental outlook. For example, if there is a bullish\nformation in both the GBPUSD and the AUDUSD due to U.S. dollar weakness,\nbut the Bank of England has ﬁnished raising interest rates, while the Reserve\nBank of Australia has full intentions of tightening to tame the strength of the\nAustralian economy, I would most likely choose to express my bearish dollar view\nin the AUDUSD rather than the GBPUSD. My bias for choosing the AUDUSD\nover the GBPUSD would be even stronger if the AUDUSD already offered a\nhigher interest rate differential than the GBPUSD. I seen technicals thwarted by\nfundamentals so often that now I always incorporate both into my trading strategy.\nI use a combination of technical, fundamental, and positioning, and am generally\nalso a trend follower. I also typically use a top-down approach that involves the\nfollowing:\n1. I will start by taking an overall technical survey of the market and pick the\ncurrency pairs that have retraced to attractive levels for entry in order to\nparticipate in a medium term fundamentally supportive trend.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS802. For currencies with a dollar component (i.e., not the crosses), I determine if my\ninitial technical view for that pair coincides with my fundamental view on the\ndollar, as well as my view on how upcoming U.S. releases may impact trading\nfor the day. The reason why I look at the dollar speciﬁcally is because 80% of all\ncurrency trades involve the dollar, which makes U.S. fundamentals particularly\nimportant.\n3. If it is a cross, I will proceed by determining if the technical view coincides with\nthe fundamental outlook using Fibonacci retracements, ADX, moving averages,\noscillators, and other technical tools.\n4. Then I like to look at positioning using the Commitment of Traders Report or\nthe FXCM Speculative Sentiment index to see if it supports the trade.\n5. If I am left with two equally compelling trade ideas, I will choose the one with\na positive interest rate differential.\nHave a Toolbox—Use What Works for the Current Market\nEnvironment\nOnce you have created a trading journal, it is time to ﬁgure out which indicators to\nlay on your charts. The reason why a lot of traders fail is because they neglect to\nrealize that their favorite indicators are not foolproof. Buying when stochastics are\nin oversold territory and selling when it is in overbought territory is a strategy that\nis used quite often by range traders, to a great deal of success, but once the market\nstops range trading and begins to trend, then relying on stochastics could lead to\ntremendous amount of losses. In order to become consistently proﬁtable, successful\ntraders need to learn to be adaptable.\nOne of the most important practices that every trader must understand is to be\nconscious of the environment that they are trading in. Every trader needs to have\nsome sort of checklist that will help to classify the trading environment so that\nthey can determine whether the market is trending or range bound. Deﬁning\ntrade parameters is one of the most important disciplines of trading. Too many\ntraders have tried to pick the top within a trend, only to wind up with consistently\nunproﬁtable trades.\nAlthough deﬁning trade parameters is important to traders in any market\n(currencies, futures, equities), it is particularly important in the currency market\nsince over 80% of the volume is speculative in nature. This means that currencies\ncan spend a very long period of time in a certain trading environment. Also, the\ncurrency market obeys technical analysis particularly well, given its large scale and\nnumber of participants.\nThere are basically two types of trading environments, which means that at any\npoint in time an instrument is either range trading or trending. The ﬁrst step every\ntrader needs to take is to deﬁne the current trading environment. The shortest time\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS81frame that traders should start looking at when their trading day starts are daily\ncharts, even if you are trading on a 5-minute time frame.\n■Step #1: Determine the Trading Environment\nRules to Determining Trading Environment\nThere are many different ways that traders can determine whether a currency pair\nis range trading or trending. Of course, many people do it visually, but having set\nrules will help to keep traders out of trends that may be fading or to prevent traders\nfrom getting into a range trade in the midst of a possible breakout. In Figure 7.3, I\nhave outlined some of the rules that I look for in order to classify a currency pair’s\ntrading environment.\nProﬁling a Range Environment\nLook for:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) less than 20 —The Average Directional Index is\none of the primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a\ntrend. When ADX is less than 20, this suggests that the trend is weak, which\nis generally characteristic of range-bound market. If ADX is less than 20 and\ntrending downward, it provides a further conﬁrmation that the trend is not only\nweak but will probably stay in a range-trading environment for a while longer.\n2.Decreasing implied volatility —There are many ways to analyze volatility. What I\nlike to do is actually track short-term versus long-term volatility. When short-\nterm volatility is falling, especially after a burst above long-term volatility, it\nis usually indicative of a reversion to range trading scenarios. Volatility usually\nTrade Rules Indicators\nRange ■ADX<20\n■Decreasing implied volatility\n■Risk reversals near choice or ﬂipping\nbetween favoring calls and putsBollinger, Bands, ADX,\nOptions\nTrend ■ADX>25\n■Momentum consistent with trend\ndirection\n■Risk reversals strongly bid for put or callMoving\naverages, ADX, Options,\nMomentum\nFIGURE 7.3 Trend/Range Trading Rules\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS82blows out when a currency pair experiences sharp, quick moves. It contracts\nwhen ranges are narrow and the trading is very quiet in the markets. The lazy\nman’s version of the way I track volatility is Bollinger Bands, which is actually\nalso a fairly decent measure for determining volatility conditions. A narrow\nBollinger Band suggests that ranges are small and there is low volatility in the\nmarkets, while wide Bollinger Bands are reﬂective of large ranges and a highly\nvolatile environment. In a range-trading environment, we are looking for fairly\nnarrow Bollinger Bands, ideally in a horizontal formation similar to the USDJPY\nchart in Figure 7.4.\n3.Risk reversals ﬂipping between calls and puts : A risk reversal consists of a pair of\noptions, a call and a put, on the same currency. Risk reversals have both the\nsame expiration (1 month) and sensitivity to the underlying spot rate. They are\nquoted in terms of the difference in volatility between the two options. While\nin theory these options should have the same implied volatility in practice, these\nvolatilities often differ in the market. Risk reversals can be seen as having a\nmarket polling function. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates\nthat the market prefers calls over puts. The reverse is true if the number is\nstrongly in favor of puts versus calls. Thus, risk reversals can be used as a\nsubstitute for gauging positions in the FX market. In an ideal environment, far\nout of the money calls and puts should have the same volatility. However, this\nis rarely the case, since there is generally a sentiment bias in the markets that\nis reﬂected in risk reversals. In range-bound environments, risk reversals tend\nFIGURE 7.4 USDJPY Bollinger Band Chart\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS83to ﬂip between favoring calls and puts at nearly zero (or equal). This indicates\nthat there is indecision among bulls and bears, and there is no strong bias in\nthe markets.\nWhat Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nAccording to the risk reversals in Figure 7.5, we can see that the market is strongly\nfavoring yen calls (JC) and dollar puts over the long term. EURUSD short-term\nrisk reversals are near choice, which is what you are looking for when proﬁling a\nrange-bound environment. Risk reversal information used to be readily available\nbut is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd these days. Currently, the only place we know of that\nprovides this information is the Bloomberg Professional Terminal, which costs over\nUS$1500 a month.\nIdentifying a Trending Environment\nLook for three things:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) greater than 20 —As mentioned earlier when we\ntalked about range-trading conditions, the Average Directional Index is one of\nthe primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a trend. In\na trending environment, we look for ADX to be greater than 25 and rising. If\nADX is greater than 25 but sloping downward, especially off of the extreme 40\nlevel, you have to be careful of aggressive trend positioning since it may indicate\nthat the trend is waning.\n2.Momentum consistent with trend direction —In addition to using ADX, I also\nrecommend looking for conﬁrmation of a trending environment through\nmomentum indicators. Traders should look for momentum to be consistent\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nCurrency 1M R/R 3M R/R 6M R/R 1YR R/R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 JC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C=Japanese yen call * SC =Sterling call\n*E C=Euro call * CC =Swiss call\n*S P=Sterling put\nFIGURE 7.5 Risk Reversals\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS84with the direction of the trend. Most currency traders will look for oscillators to\npoint strongly in the direction of the trend. For example, in an uptrend, trend\ntraders will look for the moving averages, RSI, stochastics, and MACD to all\npoint strongly upward. In a downtrend, they will look for these same indicators\nto point downward. Some currency traders use the momentum index, but in\nmy experience, it is less popular and reliable. Instead, one of the strongest\nmomentum indicators is a perfect order of moving averages. A perfect order is\nwhen we have the moving averages line up perfectly: that is, for an uptrend,\nthe 10-day SMA is greater than the 20-day SMA, which is greater 50-day SMA.\nThe 100-day SMA and the 200-day SMA are below the shorter-term moving\naverages. In a downtrend, a perfect order would be when the shorter-term\nmoving averages stack up below the longer-term moving averages.\n3.Options (risk reversals)— With a trending environment, we are looking for risk\nreversals to strongly favor calls or puts. When one side of the market is laden\nwith interest, it is usually indicative of a strong trending environment or that a\ncontra-trend move may be brewing if risk reversals are at extreme levels.\n■Step #2: Determine the Time Frame for Trade\nOnce you have determined that a currency pair is either range-bound or trending,\nit is time to determine how long you plan on holding the trade. The following is a\nset of guidelines and indicators that I use for trading different time frames. Not all\nof the guidelines need to be met, but the more guidelines that are met, the more\nsolid the trading opportunity.\nIntraday Trade (Range)\nRules:\n1. Use hourly charts to determine entry points and daily charts to conﬁrm that a\nrange trade exists on a longer-time frame.\n2. Use oscillators to determine entry point within range.\n3. Look for short-dated risk reversals to be near choice.\n4. Look for reversal in oscillators (RSI or stochastics at extreme point).\n5. Trade stronger when prices fail at key resistance or hold key support levels (use\nFibonacci retracement points and moving averages).\nIndicators Used:\nStochastics, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, options, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS85Medium-Term Range Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. There are two ways to range trade medium term—position for upcoming range\ntrading opportunities or get involved in existing ranges.\n3.Upcoming range opportunities : Look for high-volatility environments, where short-\nterm implied volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than longer-term volatilities.\nSeek reversion back to the mean environments.\n4.Existing ranges : Use Bollinger Bands to identify existing ranges.\n5. Look for reversals in oscillators such as RSI and stochastics.\n6. Make sure ADX is below 25 and ideally falling.\n7. Look for medium-term risk reversals near choice.\n8. Conﬁrm with price action—failure at key range resistances and bounces on key\nrange supports (using traditional technical indicators).\nIndicators:\nOptions, Bollinger Bands, stochastics, MACD, RSI, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nMedium-Term Trend Trade\nRules:\n1. Look for ranges on daily charts and use weekly charts for conﬁrmation.\n2. Refer back to the characteristics of a trending environment—look for those\nparameters to be met.\n3. Buy breakout/retracement scenarios on key Fibonacci levels or moving averages.\n4. Look for no major resistance levels in front of trade.\n5. Look for candlestick pattern conﬁrmation.\n6. Look for moving average conﬂuence to be on same side of trade.\n7. Enter on a break of signiﬁcant high or low.\n8. The ideal is to wait for volatilities to contract before getting in.\n9. Look for fundamentals to also be supportive of trade—growth and interest\nrates. You want to see a string of economic surprises or disappointments\ndepending on directional bias.\nIndicators\nADX, Parabolic SAR, RSI, Ichimoku Clouds, Elliot waves, Fibonacci\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS86Medium-Term Breakout Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. Look for contraction in short-term volatility to a point where it is sharply below\nlong-term volatility.\n3. Use pivot points to determine whether a break is a true break or a false break.\n4. Look for moving average conﬂuences to be supportive of trade.\nIndicators\nBollinger Bands, moving averages, Fibonacci\n■Risk Management\nAlthough risk management is one of the more simple topics to grasp, it is also one\nof the most important. Too often we have seen traders turn winning positions into\nlosing positions and solid strategies result in losses instead of proﬁts. The fact of the\nmatter is that regardless of how intelligent and knowledgeable a trader may be about\nthe markets, their own psychology will cause them to lose money. Why does this\nhappen? Are the markets really so enigmatic that few can proﬁt? Or is there simply\na common mistake that virtually all traders are prone to making? The answer is the\nlatter. And the good news is that the problem, while it can be an emotionally and\npsychologically challenging, is ultimately fairly easy to grasp and solve.\nMost traders lose money simply because they have no understanding or place no\nimportance in risk management . Risk management involves essentially knowing how\nmuch you are willing to risk and how much you are looking to gain. Without a\nsense of risk management, most traders simply hold on to losing positions for an\nextremely long amount of time, but take proﬁts on winning positions prematurely.\nThe result is a seemingly paradoxical scenario that in reality is all too common: The\ntrader ends up having more winning positions than losing ones, but ends up with a\nnegative P/L. So, what can traders do to ensure they have solid risk management\nhabits? There are a few key guidelines that every trader, regardless of their strategy\nor what they are trading, should keep in mind:\n■Risk-reward ratio . Traders should look to establish a risk-reward ratio for every\ntrade they place. In other words, they should have an idea of how much they are\nwilling to lose, and how much they are looking to gain. Generally, the risk-reward\nratio should be at least 1:2, if not more. Having a solid risk-reward ratio can\nprevent traders from entering positions that ultimately are not worth the risk.\n■Stop-loss orders . Traders should also employ stop-loss orders as a way of specifying\nthe maximum loss they are willing to accept. By using stop-loss orders, traders\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS87can avoid the common predicament of being in a scenario where they have many\nwinning trades but a single loss large enough to eliminate any trace of proﬁtability\nin the account. Trailing stops to lock in proﬁts are particularly useful. A good\nhabit of more successful traders is to employ the rule of moving your stop to\nbreak even as soon as your position has proﬁted by the same amount that you\ninitially risked through the stop order. At the same time, some traders may also\nchoose to close a portion of their position.\nFor those looking to add to a winning position or go with trend, the best strategy\nis to treat it as if it were a new trade of its own, independent of the winning position.\nIf you are going to add to a winning position, perform the same analysis of the chart\nthat you would if you had no position at all. If a trade continues to go in your favor,\nyou can also close out part of the position while trailing your stop higher on the\nremaining lots that you are holding. Try thinking about your risk and reward on\neach separate lot that you have bought if they are at different entry points as well. If\nyou buy a second lot 50 pips above your ﬁrst entry point, don’t use the same stop\nprice on both, but manage the risk on the second lot independently from the ﬁrst.\nUsing Stop-Loss Orders to Manage Risk\nGiven the importance of money management to successful trading, using the stop-\nloss order is imperative for any trader looking to succeed in the currency market.\nStop-loss orders allow traders to specify the maximum loss they are willing to\naccept on any given trade. If the market reaches the rate the trader speciﬁes in\nhis/her stop-loss order, then the trade will be closed immediately. As a result, using\nstop-loss orders allows you to know how much you are risking at the time you enter\nthe trade.\nThere are two parts to successfully using a stop-loss order: (1) initially placing\nthe stop at a reasonable level and (2) trailing the stop—or moving it forward toward\nproﬁtability—as the trade progresses in your favor.\nPlacing the Stop Loss\nWe recommend two ways of placing a trailing stop-loss order:\n■The ﬁrst is a two-day low method . These volatility-based stops involve placing your\nstop-loss order approximately 10 to 20 pips below the two-day low of the pair.\nFor example, if the low on the EURUSD’s most recent candle was 1.1200, and\nthe previous candle’s low was 1.1100, then the stop should be placed around\n1.1090—10 pips below the two-day low—if a trader is looking to get long. This\ntype of trailing stop allows you to keep tight control of the position and minimizes\nthe time in trade. The downside is that it can be closed prematurely during a brief\nperiod of consolidation.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS88■Parabolic SAR . Another form of volatility-based stop is the parabolic SAR, an\nindicator that is found on many currency trading charting applications. This\nindicator graphically displays a small dot at the point on the chart where the stop\nshould be placed. The beneﬁt of parabolic SAR is that it is dynamic and generally\nfurther away from the current price.\nThere is no magic formula for what works best in every situation, but the\nfollowing is an example of how these stops could be used.\nUpon entering a long position, determine where support is and place a stop 20\npips below support. For example, let’s say this is 60 pips below the entry point. If\nthe trade earns a proﬁt of 60 pips, close half of my position using a market order,\nthen move the stop up to the entry point. At this point, trail the stop 60 pips behind\nthe moving market price. If the parabolic SAR moves up so that it is above the entry\npoint, you could switch to using parabolic SAR as the stop level. Of course, during\nthe day, there can be other signals that could prompt you to move your stop. If the\nprice breaks through a new resistance level, that resistance then becomes support.\nYou can place a stop 20 pips below that support level, even if it is only 30–40\npips away from the current price. The underlying principle you have to use is to\nﬁnd a point to place your stop where you would no longer want to be in the trade\nonce the price reaches that level. Usually it falls at a point where the price goes\nbelow support.\nAside from employing proper risk management strategies, one of the other\nmore crucial yet overlooked elements of successful trading is maintaining a healthy\npsychological outlook. At the end of the day, a trader who is unable to cope with the\nstress of market ﬂuctuations will not stand the test of time—no matter how skilled\nthey may be at the more scientiﬁc elements of trading. Here are some tips:\n■Practice emotional detachment . That is, traders must make trading decisions based on\nstrategies independent of fear and greed. One of the premiere attributes a good\ntrader has is emotional detachment: While these traders are dedicated and fully\ninvolved in their trades, they are not emotionally married to them; they accept\nlosing, and make their investment decisions on an intellectual level. Traders who\nare emotionally involved in trading often make substantial errors, as they tend\nto whimsically change their strategy after a few losing trades, or become overly\ncarefree after a few winning trades. A good trader must be emotionally balanced,\nand must base all trading decisions on strategy—not fear or greed.\n■Know when to take a break . In the midst of a losing streak, consider taking a break\nfrom trading before fear and greed dominate your strategy.\nNot every trade can be a winning one. As a result, traders must be psycholog-\nically capable of coping with losses. Most traders, even successful ones, will go\nthrough a stretch of losing trades. The key to being a successful trader, though,\nis being able to go through a losing stretch unfazed and undeterred. If you are\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS89experiencing a string of losing trades, it may be time to take a break from trading.\nOften, taking a few days off from watching the market to clear your mind can be\nthe best remedy for a losing streak. Continuing to trade relentlessly during a tough\nmarket condition can breed greater losses and ruin your psychological trading\ncapacity. Ultimately, it’s always better to acknowledge your losses rather than\ncontinue to ﬁght through them and pretend they don’t exist. Make no mistake\nabout it: Regardless of how much you study, practice, or trade, there will be losing\ntrades throughout your entire career. The key is to make them small enough that\nyou can live to trade another day and allow your winning trades room to breathe\nand ﬂourish. You can overcome a lot of bad luck with proper money management\ntechniques. This is why we have stressed a 2:1 reward to risk ratio, and why we\nrecommend not risking more than 2% of your equity on any single trade.\nWhether you are trading forex, equities, or futures, there are 10 trading rules\nthat successful traders should live by:\n1. Limit your losses.\n2. Let your proﬁts run.\n3. Keep position sizes within reason.\n4. Know your risk versus reward ratio.\n5. Be adequately capitalized.\n6. Don’t ﬁght the trend.\n7. Never add to losing positions.\n8. Know market expectations.\n9. Learn from your mistake—keep a trade log.\n10. Have a maximum drawdown.",
        "73CHAPTER 7\nTrade Parameters\nfor Various Market\nConditions\nAfter learning about the emergence of the foreign exchange market, who the\nmajor players are, signiﬁcant historical milestones, and what moves the markets,\nit is time to move on and discuss some of my favorite strategies for trading currencies.\nHowever, before I even begin going over these strategies, the most important ﬁrst\nstep for any trader, regardless of the market that you are trading in, is to create a\ntrading journal.\n■Keep a Trading Journal\nThrough my experience, I have learned that being a successful trader is not about\nﬁnding the holy grail of indicators that can perfectly forecast movements 100% of\nthe time, but instead, to develop discipline. I cannot undermine the importance of\n‘‘the journal’’ as the primary ﬁrst step to becoming a successful and professional\ntrader. While working on the Inter-bank FX trading desk at J.P. Morgan and then\non the Cross-Markets trading desk after the merger with Chase, the trading journal\nmentality was engrained into the minds of every dealer and proprietary trader on the\ntrading ﬂoors, regardless of rank. The reason was simple—the bank was providing\nthe capital for trading and we needed to be held accountable, especially since each\ntransaction involved millions of dollars. For every trade that was executed, we\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS74needed to have a solid rationale as well as justiﬁcation for the choice of entry and exit\nlevels. More speciﬁcally, you had to know where to place your exit points before\nyou placed the trade to approximate worst case losses and to manage risk.\nWith this sort of accountability, the leading banks of the world are able to breed\nsuccessful and professional traders. For individual traders, this practice is even more\nimportant because you are trading with your own money and not someone else’s.\nBank traders are trading with someone else’s money so regardless of how poorly\nthey perform over a one- or two-week basis, they will receive their paycheck twice\na month. At a bank, traders have plenty of time to make the money back without any\ndisruptions to their daily way of life—unless of course they lose $1 million in one\nday. As an individual trader—you do not have this luxury. When you are trading\nwith your own money, each dollar lost is a dollar less that you own. So even though\nyou should only be trading with risk capital, or money that would not otherwise be\nused for rent or groceries, one way or the other, the pain is felt. To avoid repeating\nthe same mistakes and taking large losses, I cannot stress enough the importance of\nkeeping a trading journal. The journal is designed to ensure that as a trader, you\nonly take calculated losses and learn from each mistake. The trading journal setup\nthat I recommend should be broken up into three parts:\n1. Currency pair checklist\n2. Trades that I am waiting for\n3. Existing or completed trades\nCurrency Pair Checklist\nThe ﬁrst section of your trading journal should consist of a spreadsheet that can be\nprinted out and completed every day. This purpose of this checklist is to get a feel\nof the market and to identify trades. It should list of all of the currency pairs that are\noffered for trading on the left column, followed by three columns for the current,\nhigh, and low prices, and then a series of triggers laid out as a row on the right\nhand side. Newer traders should start with following only the four major currency\npairs, which are the EURUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, and the GBPUSD, and then\ngradually add the AUDUSD, USDCAD, and NZDUSD, followed by the nondollar\npairs. Although the checklist that I have created is fairly detailed, I ﬁnd that it is\na very useful daily exercise and should take no more than 20 minutes to complete\nonce the appropriate indicators are saved on the charts. The purpose of this checklist\nis to get a clear visual of which currencies are trending and which are range trading.\nComprehending the big picture is the ﬁrst step to trading successfully. Too often\nhave I seen traders fail because they lose sight of the overall environment that they\nare trading in. The worst thing to do is to trade blindly. Trying to pick tops or\nbottoms in a strong trend or buying breakouts in a range-bound environment can\nlead to signiﬁcant losses. Just take a look at Figure 7.1 of the EURUSD. If you tried\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS75\nFIGURE 7.1 EURUSD Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS76to pick bottoms in this pair, it would have led to an entire year of frustrating and\nunsuccessful trading. In trending environments, traders will ﬁnd a higher success\nrate by buying on retracements in an uptrend or selling on rallies in a downtrend.\nPicking tops and bottoms should only be a strategy that is used in clear range trading\nenvironments and even with that, traders need to be careful of contracting ranges\nthat can lead to breakout scenarios.\nA simpliﬁed version of the daily market overview sheet that I use is shown in\nFigure 7.2.\nAs you can see in Figure 7.2, the ﬁrst two columns after the daily high and low\nprices are the levels of the 10-day high or low. Recording this price helps to identify\nwhere current prices are within previous price action. This helps traders get a gauge\nof whether we are pressing toward a 10-day high or low or if we are simply trapped\nin the middle of the range. Yet the prices alone do not provide enough information\nto determine if we are in a trending or a range-bound environment. The next ﬁve\nindicators is a checklist for determining a trending environment. The more X marks\nin this section, the stronger the trend.\nThe ﬁrst column in the trending indicator group is the ‘‘ADX (14) above 25.’’\nADX is the Accumulation Distribution Index, which is the most popular used\nindicator for determining the strength of a trend. If the index reading is above 25,\nit indicates that a trend has developed. Generally speaking, the greater the number,\nthe stronger the trend. The next column is Bollinger Bands. When strong trends\ndevelop, the pair will frequently tag and cross either the upper or lower Bollinger\nBand. The next three trend indicators are the longer term moving averages. A\nbreak above or below these moving averages may also be indicative of a trending\nenvironment. With moving averages, crossovers in the direction of the trend can be\nused as a further conﬁrmation. If there are two or more Xs in this section, traders\nshould be looking for opportunities to buy on dips in an uptrend or sell on rallies in a\ndowntrend rather than selling at the top and buying back at the bottom of the range.\nThe last section of the trading journal is indications of range. The ﬁrst indicator is\nalso ADX, but this time, we are looking for ADX below 25, which signals that the\ncurrency pair’s trend is weak. Next, we look at the traditional oscillators, RSI and\nstochastics. If the ADX is weak and there is signiﬁcant technical resistance above,\nprovided by indicators such as moving averages or Fibonacci retracement levels,\nand RSI and/or stochastics are at overbought or oversold levels, we identify an\nenvironment that is highly conducive to range trading.\nOf course, the market overview sheet is not foolproof, and just because you have\na lot of X marks in either the trend or range group doesn’t mean that a trend will\nnot fade or a breakout will not occur. Yet, what this spreadsheet will do is prevent\ntraders from trading blindly and ignoring the broader market conditions. It provides\ntraders with a launching pad from which to identify the day’s trading opportunities.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS77Date - Time\nTrending Range\nCurrencyPair Current\nPriceDaily\nHighDaily\nLow10-day\nHigh10-day\nLowBollinger\nBand UpBollinger\nBand Down(14)\nabove 25Crosses\n50-DayCrosses\n100-dayCrosses\n200-dayBollinger\nBand\nRangeADX\n(14)\nbelow\n25RS1 (14)\nGreater\nthan 80(14)\nLess\nthan 80Stochastics\n>70Stochastics\n<30\nEURUSD 1.105 1.1144 1.0923 X X X X\nGBPUSD\nUSDJPY\nUSDCHF\nAUDUSD\nNZDUSD\nUSDCAD\nEURJPY\nEURGBP\nEURCHF\nAUDJPY\nCHFJPY\nGBPJPY\nGBPCHF\nAUDCAD\nEURCAD\nAUDNZD\nFIGURE 7.2 Currency Checklist\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS78Trades That I Am Waiting For\nThe next section in the trading journal lists out the possible trades for the day. Based\non an initial overview of the charts, this section is where you should list the trades\nfor which you are waiting. A sample entry would look like the following:\nApril 5, 2015\nBuy AUDUSD on a break of 0.7850 (previous day high)\nStop at 0.7800 (50-day SMA)\nTarget 1—0.7925 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement of Nov-Mar bull wave)\nTarget 2—0.8075 (Upper Bollinger)\nTarget 3—10-day Trailing Low\nAs soon as your entry level is reached, you know exactly how to take action and\nwhere to place your stops and limits. Of course, it is also important to take a quick\nglance at the market to make sure that the trading conditions that you were waiting\nfor are still intact. For example, if you were looking for a strong breakout with no\nretracement to occur at the entry level, when it does break, you want to make sure\nthat the break has decent momentum. This exercise will help you develop a plan of\naction to approach your trading day. Before every battle, warriors will regroup to\ngo over the plan of attack—in trading, you want to have the same mentality. Plan\nand prepare for the worst-case scenario and know your plan of attack for the day!\nExisting or Completed Trades\nThis section is developed and used to enforce discipline and to learn from your\nmistakes. At the end of each trading day, it is important to review this section to\nunderstand why certain trades resulted in losses and others in proﬁts. The purpose\nof this section is to identify trends. To understand why this is important, let’s look\nat an example that is completely unrelated to trading. On a normal given day,\nmost people will subconsciously inject a lot of ‘‘ums’’ or ‘‘uhs’’ into their daily\nconversation. However, most of these people do not even realize that they are even\ndoing so until someone records their conversation and replays it back to them. This\nis one of the ways that professional presenters and newscasters train to kick the\nhabit of using placeholder words. Having worked with over 65,000 traders, too\noften have I seen these traders make the same mistakes repeatedly. This includes\ntaking proﬁts too early, letting losses run, getting emotional about trading, ignoring\neconomic releases, or entering a trade prematurely. Keeping a record of previous\ntrades is like keeping a recording of your conversations. When you ﬂip back to the\ntrades that you have completed, you may have a perfect map of what strategies have\nor have not been proﬁtable for you. The reason why a journal is so important is\nbecause it minimizes the emotional intervention of trades. I frequently see novice\ntraders take proﬁts early but let losses run. The following are two samples of trade\njournal entries that could have provided learning opportunities:\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS79February 12, 2015\nTrade: Short 3 lots of EURUSD @ 1.1045\nStop: 1.1195 (former all-time high)\nTarget: 1.0800\nResult: Trade closed on Feb 13, 2015—stopped out of the 3 lots @ 1.1195\n(–150 pips)\nComments: Got margin call! It broke the all-time high, I thought it was going\nto reverse, did not stick to stop—kept letting losses run, eventually margin\ncall closed out all positions. Note to self: MAKE SURE STICK TO STOPS!\nApril 3, 2015\nTrade: Long 2 lots of USDCAD @ 1.2135\nStop: 1.2000 (strong technical support—conﬂuence of 50-day moving average\nand 68% Fibonacci retracement of Feb—March rally)\nTarget: First lot @ 1.2295 (upper Bollinger and 5 pips shy of 1.2300 psychological\nresistance)\nSecond lot @ 1.2450 (Former head and shoulders support turned resistance,\n100-day SMA)\nResult: Trade closed on April 5, 2015—stopped out of the 2 lots at 1.2000\n(–135 pips)\nComments: USDCAD did not continue uptrend and was becoming overbought,\nI didn’t see that ADX was weakening and falling from higher levels, there was\nalso a divergence in Stochastics. Note to self: MAKE SURE TO LOOK FOR\nDIVERGENCES NEXT TIME!\nUnlike many traders, the best trades in my opinion are the trades where both\ntechnicals and fundamentals support the trade. In general, I prefer to stay out of\ntrades that contradict my fundamental outlook. For example, if there is a bullish\nformation in both the GBPUSD and the AUDUSD due to U.S. dollar weakness,\nbut the Bank of England has ﬁnished raising interest rates, while the Reserve\nBank of Australia has full intentions of tightening to tame the strength of the\nAustralian economy, I would most likely choose to express my bearish dollar view\nin the AUDUSD rather than the GBPUSD. My bias for choosing the AUDUSD\nover the GBPUSD would be even stronger if the AUDUSD already offered a\nhigher interest rate differential than the GBPUSD. I seen technicals thwarted by\nfundamentals so often that now I always incorporate both into my trading strategy.\nI use a combination of technical, fundamental, and positioning, and am generally\nalso a trend follower. I also typically use a top-down approach that involves the\nfollowing:\n1. I will start by taking an overall technical survey of the market and pick the\ncurrency pairs that have retraced to attractive levels for entry in order to\nparticipate in a medium term fundamentally supportive trend.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS802. For currencies with a dollar component (i.e., not the crosses), I determine if my\ninitial technical view for that pair coincides with my fundamental view on the\ndollar, as well as my view on how upcoming U.S. releases may impact trading\nfor the day. The reason why I look at the dollar speciﬁcally is because 80% of all\ncurrency trades involve the dollar, which makes U.S. fundamentals particularly\nimportant.\n3. If it is a cross, I will proceed by determining if the technical view coincides with\nthe fundamental outlook using Fibonacci retracements, ADX, moving averages,\noscillators, and other technical tools.\n4. Then I like to look at positioning using the Commitment of Traders Report or\nthe FXCM Speculative Sentiment index to see if it supports the trade.\n5. If I am left with two equally compelling trade ideas, I will choose the one with\na positive interest rate differential.\nHave a Toolbox—Use What Works for the Current Market\nEnvironment\nOnce you have created a trading journal, it is time to ﬁgure out which indicators to\nlay on your charts. The reason why a lot of traders fail is because they neglect to\nrealize that their favorite indicators are not foolproof. Buying when stochastics are\nin oversold territory and selling when it is in overbought territory is a strategy that\nis used quite often by range traders, to a great deal of success, but once the market\nstops range trading and begins to trend, then relying on stochastics could lead to\ntremendous amount of losses. In order to become consistently proﬁtable, successful\ntraders need to learn to be adaptable.\nOne of the most important practices that every trader must understand is to be\nconscious of the environment that they are trading in. Every trader needs to have\nsome sort of checklist that will help to classify the trading environment so that\nthey can determine whether the market is trending or range bound. Deﬁning\ntrade parameters is one of the most important disciplines of trading. Too many\ntraders have tried to pick the top within a trend, only to wind up with consistently\nunproﬁtable trades.\nAlthough deﬁning trade parameters is important to traders in any market\n(currencies, futures, equities), it is particularly important in the currency market\nsince over 80% of the volume is speculative in nature. This means that currencies\ncan spend a very long period of time in a certain trading environment. Also, the\ncurrency market obeys technical analysis particularly well, given its large scale and\nnumber of participants.\nThere are basically two types of trading environments, which means that at any\npoint in time an instrument is either range trading or trending. The ﬁrst step every\ntrader needs to take is to deﬁne the current trading environment. The shortest time\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS81frame that traders should start looking at when their trading day starts are daily\ncharts, even if you are trading on a 5-minute time frame.\n■Step #1: Determine the Trading Environment\nRules to Determining Trading Environment\nThere are many different ways that traders can determine whether a currency pair\nis range trading or trending. Of course, many people do it visually, but having set\nrules will help to keep traders out of trends that may be fading or to prevent traders\nfrom getting into a range trade in the midst of a possible breakout. In Figure 7.3, I\nhave outlined some of the rules that I look for in order to classify a currency pair’s\ntrading environment.\nProﬁling a Range Environment\nLook for:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) less than 20 —The Average Directional Index is\none of the primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a\ntrend. When ADX is less than 20, this suggests that the trend is weak, which\nis generally characteristic of range-bound market. If ADX is less than 20 and\ntrending downward, it provides a further conﬁrmation that the trend is not only\nweak but will probably stay in a range-trading environment for a while longer.\n2.Decreasing implied volatility —There are many ways to analyze volatility. What I\nlike to do is actually track short-term versus long-term volatility. When short-\nterm volatility is falling, especially after a burst above long-term volatility, it\nis usually indicative of a reversion to range trading scenarios. Volatility usually\nTrade Rules Indicators\nRange ■ADX<20\n■Decreasing implied volatility\n■Risk reversals near choice or ﬂipping\nbetween favoring calls and putsBollinger, Bands, ADX,\nOptions\nTrend ■ADX>25\n■Momentum consistent with trend\ndirection\n■Risk reversals strongly bid for put or callMoving\naverages, ADX, Options,\nMomentum\nFIGURE 7.3 Trend/Range Trading Rules\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS82blows out when a currency pair experiences sharp, quick moves. It contracts\nwhen ranges are narrow and the trading is very quiet in the markets. The lazy\nman’s version of the way I track volatility is Bollinger Bands, which is actually\nalso a fairly decent measure for determining volatility conditions. A narrow\nBollinger Band suggests that ranges are small and there is low volatility in the\nmarkets, while wide Bollinger Bands are reﬂective of large ranges and a highly\nvolatile environment. In a range-trading environment, we are looking for fairly\nnarrow Bollinger Bands, ideally in a horizontal formation similar to the USDJPY\nchart in Figure 7.4.\n3.Risk reversals ﬂipping between calls and puts : A risk reversal consists of a pair of\noptions, a call and a put, on the same currency. Risk reversals have both the\nsame expiration (1 month) and sensitivity to the underlying spot rate. They are\nquoted in terms of the difference in volatility between the two options. While\nin theory these options should have the same implied volatility in practice, these\nvolatilities often differ in the market. Risk reversals can be seen as having a\nmarket polling function. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates\nthat the market prefers calls over puts. The reverse is true if the number is\nstrongly in favor of puts versus calls. Thus, risk reversals can be used as a\nsubstitute for gauging positions in the FX market. In an ideal environment, far\nout of the money calls and puts should have the same volatility. However, this\nis rarely the case, since there is generally a sentiment bias in the markets that\nis reﬂected in risk reversals. In range-bound environments, risk reversals tend\nFIGURE 7.4 USDJPY Bollinger Band Chart\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS83to ﬂip between favoring calls and puts at nearly zero (or equal). This indicates\nthat there is indecision among bulls and bears, and there is no strong bias in\nthe markets.\nWhat Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nAccording to the risk reversals in Figure 7.5, we can see that the market is strongly\nfavoring yen calls (JC) and dollar puts over the long term. EURUSD short-term\nrisk reversals are near choice, which is what you are looking for when proﬁling a\nrange-bound environment. Risk reversal information used to be readily available\nbut is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd these days. Currently, the only place we know of that\nprovides this information is the Bloomberg Professional Terminal, which costs over\nUS$1500 a month.\nIdentifying a Trending Environment\nLook for three things:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) greater than 20 —As mentioned earlier when we\ntalked about range-trading conditions, the Average Directional Index is one of\nthe primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a trend. In\na trending environment, we look for ADX to be greater than 25 and rising. If\nADX is greater than 25 but sloping downward, especially off of the extreme 40\nlevel, you have to be careful of aggressive trend positioning since it may indicate\nthat the trend is waning.\n2.Momentum consistent with trend direction —In addition to using ADX, I also\nrecommend looking for conﬁrmation of a trending environment through\nmomentum indicators. Traders should look for momentum to be consistent\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nCurrency 1M R/R 3M R/R 6M R/R 1YR R/R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 JC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C=Japanese yen call * SC =Sterling call\n*E C=Euro call * CC =Swiss call\n*S P=Sterling put\nFIGURE 7.5 Risk Reversals\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS84with the direction of the trend. Most currency traders will look for oscillators to\npoint strongly in the direction of the trend. For example, in an uptrend, trend\ntraders will look for the moving averages, RSI, stochastics, and MACD to all\npoint strongly upward. In a downtrend, they will look for these same indicators\nto point downward. Some currency traders use the momentum index, but in\nmy experience, it is less popular and reliable. Instead, one of the strongest\nmomentum indicators is a perfect order of moving averages. A perfect order is\nwhen we have the moving averages line up perfectly: that is, for an uptrend,\nthe 10-day SMA is greater than the 20-day SMA, which is greater 50-day SMA.\nThe 100-day SMA and the 200-day SMA are below the shorter-term moving\naverages. In a downtrend, a perfect order would be when the shorter-term\nmoving averages stack up below the longer-term moving averages.\n3.Options (risk reversals)— With a trending environment, we are looking for risk\nreversals to strongly favor calls or puts. When one side of the market is laden\nwith interest, it is usually indicative of a strong trending environment or that a\ncontra-trend move may be brewing if risk reversals are at extreme levels.\n■Step #2: Determine the Time Frame for Trade\nOnce you have determined that a currency pair is either range-bound or trending,\nit is time to determine how long you plan on holding the trade. The following is a\nset of guidelines and indicators that I use for trading different time frames. Not all\nof the guidelines need to be met, but the more guidelines that are met, the more\nsolid the trading opportunity.\nIntraday Trade (Range)\nRules:\n1. Use hourly charts to determine entry points and daily charts to conﬁrm that a\nrange trade exists on a longer-time frame.\n2. Use oscillators to determine entry point within range.\n3. Look for short-dated risk reversals to be near choice.\n4. Look for reversal in oscillators (RSI or stochastics at extreme point).\n5. Trade stronger when prices fail at key resistance or hold key support levels (use\nFibonacci retracement points and moving averages).\nIndicators Used:\nStochastics, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, options, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS85Medium-Term Range Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. There are two ways to range trade medium term—position for upcoming range\ntrading opportunities or get involved in existing ranges.\n3.Upcoming range opportunities : Look for high-volatility environments, where short-\nterm implied volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than longer-term volatilities.\nSeek reversion back to the mean environments.\n4.Existing ranges : Use Bollinger Bands to identify existing ranges.\n5. Look for reversals in oscillators such as RSI and stochastics.\n6. Make sure ADX is below 25 and ideally falling.\n7. Look for medium-term risk reversals near choice.\n8. Conﬁrm with price action—failure at key range resistances and bounces on key\nrange supports (using traditional technical indicators).\nIndicators:\nOptions, Bollinger Bands, stochastics, MACD, RSI, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nMedium-Term Trend Trade\nRules:\n1. Look for ranges on daily charts and use weekly charts for conﬁrmation.\n2. Refer back to the characteristics of a trending environment—look for those\nparameters to be met.\n3. Buy breakout/retracement scenarios on key Fibonacci levels or moving averages.\n4. Look for no major resistance levels in front of trade.\n5. Look for candlestick pattern conﬁrmation.\n6. Look for moving average conﬂuence to be on same side of trade.\n7. Enter on a break of signiﬁcant high or low.\n8. The ideal is to wait for volatilities to contract before getting in.\n9. Look for fundamentals to also be supportive of trade—growth and interest\nrates. You want to see a string of economic surprises or disappointments\ndepending on directional bias.\nIndicators\nADX, Parabolic SAR, RSI, Ichimoku Clouds, Elliot waves, Fibonacci\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS86Medium-Term Breakout Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. Look for contraction in short-term volatility to a point where it is sharply below\nlong-term volatility.\n3. Use pivot points to determine whether a break is a true break or a false break.\n4. Look for moving average conﬂuences to be supportive of trade.\nIndicators\nBollinger Bands, moving averages, Fibonacci\n■Risk Management\nAlthough risk management is one of the more simple topics to grasp, it is also one\nof the most important. Too often we have seen traders turn winning positions into\nlosing positions and solid strategies result in losses instead of proﬁts. The fact of the\nmatter is that regardless of how intelligent and knowledgeable a trader may be about\nthe markets, their own psychology will cause them to lose money. Why does this\nhappen? Are the markets really so enigmatic that few can proﬁt? Or is there simply\na common mistake that virtually all traders are prone to making? The answer is the\nlatter. And the good news is that the problem, while it can be an emotionally and\npsychologically challenging, is ultimately fairly easy to grasp and solve.\nMost traders lose money simply because they have no understanding or place no\nimportance in risk management . Risk management involves essentially knowing how\nmuch you are willing to risk and how much you are looking to gain. Without a\nsense of risk management, most traders simply hold on to losing positions for an\nextremely long amount of time, but take proﬁts on winning positions prematurely.\nThe result is a seemingly paradoxical scenario that in reality is all too common: The\ntrader ends up having more winning positions than losing ones, but ends up with a\nnegative P/L. So, what can traders do to ensure they have solid risk management\nhabits? There are a few key guidelines that every trader, regardless of their strategy\nor what they are trading, should keep in mind:\n■Risk-reward ratio . Traders should look to establish a risk-reward ratio for every\ntrade they place. In other words, they should have an idea of how much they are\nwilling to lose, and how much they are looking to gain. Generally, the risk-reward\nratio should be at least 1:2, if not more. Having a solid risk-reward ratio can\nprevent traders from entering positions that ultimately are not worth the risk.\n■Stop-loss orders . Traders should also employ stop-loss orders as a way of specifying\nthe maximum loss they are willing to accept. By using stop-loss orders, traders\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS87can avoid the common predicament of being in a scenario where they have many\nwinning trades but a single loss large enough to eliminate any trace of proﬁtability\nin the account. Trailing stops to lock in proﬁts are particularly useful. A good\nhabit of more successful traders is to employ the rule of moving your stop to\nbreak even as soon as your position has proﬁted by the same amount that you\ninitially risked through the stop order. At the same time, some traders may also\nchoose to close a portion of their position.\nFor those looking to add to a winning position or go with trend, the best strategy\nis to treat it as if it were a new trade of its own, independent of the winning position.\nIf you are going to add to a winning position, perform the same analysis of the chart\nthat you would if you had no position at all. If a trade continues to go in your favor,\nyou can also close out part of the position while trailing your stop higher on the\nremaining lots that you are holding. Try thinking about your risk and reward on\neach separate lot that you have bought if they are at different entry points as well. If\nyou buy a second lot 50 pips above your ﬁrst entry point, don’t use the same stop\nprice on both, but manage the risk on the second lot independently from the ﬁrst.\nUsing Stop-Loss Orders to Manage Risk\nGiven the importance of money management to successful trading, using the stop-\nloss order is imperative for any trader looking to succeed in the currency market.\nStop-loss orders allow traders to specify the maximum loss they are willing to\naccept on any given trade. If the market reaches the rate the trader speciﬁes in\nhis/her stop-loss order, then the trade will be closed immediately. As a result, using\nstop-loss orders allows you to know how much you are risking at the time you enter\nthe trade.\nThere are two parts to successfully using a stop-loss order: (1) initially placing\nthe stop at a reasonable level and (2) trailing the stop—or moving it forward toward\nproﬁtability—as the trade progresses in your favor.\nPlacing the Stop Loss\nWe recommend two ways of placing a trailing stop-loss order:\n■The ﬁrst is a two-day low method . These volatility-based stops involve placing your\nstop-loss order approximately 10 to 20 pips below the two-day low of the pair.\nFor example, if the low on the EURUSD’s most recent candle was 1.1200, and\nthe previous candle’s low was 1.1100, then the stop should be placed around\n1.1090—10 pips below the two-day low—if a trader is looking to get long. This\ntype of trailing stop allows you to keep tight control of the position and minimizes\nthe time in trade. The downside is that it can be closed prematurely during a brief\nperiod of consolidation.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS88■Parabolic SAR . Another form of volatility-based stop is the parabolic SAR, an\nindicator that is found on many currency trading charting applications. This\nindicator graphically displays a small dot at the point on the chart where the stop\nshould be placed. The beneﬁt of parabolic SAR is that it is dynamic and generally\nfurther away from the current price.\nThere is no magic formula for what works best in every situation, but the\nfollowing is an example of how these stops could be used.\nUpon entering a long position, determine where support is and place a stop 20\npips below support. For example, let’s say this is 60 pips below the entry point. If\nthe trade earns a proﬁt of 60 pips, close half of my position using a market order,\nthen move the stop up to the entry point. At this point, trail the stop 60 pips behind\nthe moving market price. If the parabolic SAR moves up so that it is above the entry\npoint, you could switch to using parabolic SAR as the stop level. Of course, during\nthe day, there can be other signals that could prompt you to move your stop. If the\nprice breaks through a new resistance level, that resistance then becomes support.\nYou can place a stop 20 pips below that support level, even if it is only 30–40\npips away from the current price. The underlying principle you have to use is to\nﬁnd a point to place your stop where you would no longer want to be in the trade\nonce the price reaches that level. Usually it falls at a point where the price goes\nbelow support.\nAside from employing proper risk management strategies, one of the other\nmore crucial yet overlooked elements of successful trading is maintaining a healthy\npsychological outlook. At the end of the day, a trader who is unable to cope with the\nstress of market ﬂuctuations will not stand the test of time—no matter how skilled\nthey may be at the more scientiﬁc elements of trading. Here are some tips:\n■Practice emotional detachment . That is, traders must make trading decisions based on\nstrategies independent of fear and greed. One of the premiere attributes a good\ntrader has is emotional detachment: While these traders are dedicated and fully\ninvolved in their trades, they are not emotionally married to them; they accept\nlosing, and make their investment decisions on an intellectual level. Traders who\nare emotionally involved in trading often make substantial errors, as they tend\nto whimsically change their strategy after a few losing trades, or become overly\ncarefree after a few winning trades. A good trader must be emotionally balanced,\nand must base all trading decisions on strategy—not fear or greed.\n■Know when to take a break . In the midst of a losing streak, consider taking a break\nfrom trading before fear and greed dominate your strategy.\nNot every trade can be a winning one. As a result, traders must be psycholog-\nically capable of coping with losses. Most traders, even successful ones, will go\nthrough a stretch of losing trades. The key to being a successful trader, though,\nis being able to go through a losing stretch unfazed and undeterred. If you are\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS89experiencing a string of losing trades, it may be time to take a break from trading.\nOften, taking a few days off from watching the market to clear your mind can be\nthe best remedy for a losing streak. Continuing to trade relentlessly during a tough\nmarket condition can breed greater losses and ruin your psychological trading\ncapacity. Ultimately, it’s always better to acknowledge your losses rather than\ncontinue to ﬁght through them and pretend they don’t exist. Make no mistake\nabout it: Regardless of how much you study, practice, or trade, there will be losing\ntrades throughout your entire career. The key is to make them small enough that\nyou can live to trade another day and allow your winning trades room to breathe\nand ﬂourish. You can overcome a lot of bad luck with proper money management\ntechniques. This is why we have stressed a 2:1 reward to risk ratio, and why we\nrecommend not risking more than 2% of your equity on any single trade.\nWhether you are trading forex, equities, or futures, there are 10 trading rules\nthat successful traders should live by:\n1. Limit your losses.\n2. Let your proﬁts run.\n3. Keep position sizes within reason.\n4. Know your risk versus reward ratio.\n5. Be adequately capitalized.\n6. Don’t ﬁght the trend.\n7. Never add to losing positions.\n8. Know market expectations.\n9. Learn from your mistake—keep a trade log.\n10. Have a maximum drawdown."

        "91CHAPTER 8\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Multiple\nTime Frame\nAnalysis\nTo trade successfully on an intraday basis, it is important to be selective. Trend\ntrading is one of the most popular strategies employed by global macro hedge\nfunds. Although many traders prefer to range trade, the big proﬁt potentials tend to\nlie in trades that capture and participate in big market moves.

This is a daily chart of the\nU.S. dollar against the Japanese yen (USDJPY). As you can see, USDJPY has been\ntrending higher since late 2012. During this period, range or contrarian traders\nlooking to pick tops would have been faced with at least two years of difﬁcult and\nmost likely unproﬁtable trading—particularly when the currency pair was hitting\nthree- or four-year highs in late 2013 and early 2014. This area would have certainly\nattracted a good deal of traders looking to pick a top or to fade the trend. Despite\na dip in mid-2013, USDJPY remained strong going into 2105, making life very\ndifﬁcult for medium-term range players.\nInstead, the more effective trading str ategy would have been to take a position\nin the direction of the trend. In USDJPY, this would have involved looking for\nopportunities to buy on dips. Figure 8.2 shows one way to do so on a 15-minute\nchart using the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Rather than looking for opportunities\nto sell when RSI rose above 70, it was smarter to buy when it dipped to 30. The ﬁrst\nhorizontal line in Figure 8.2 shows the point at which RSI rose above 70. If you sold\nat that level, USDJPY would have moved against you by 40 pips before reversing.\nThe second horizontal line shows the point at which RSI dipped to 30. If you bought\nat that level, you would have picked the bottom on this short term USDJPY chart\nfor a move of at least 50 pips.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS93\nFIGURE 8.2 USDJPY 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nNow let’s take a look at another example of the British pound. Figure 8.3\nshows the monthly chart of the USDCAD from January 2013 to January 2015. Like\nUSDJPY, traders trying to pick tops in the USDCAD would have faced at least two\nstraight years of difﬁcult trading—particularly when the USDCAD was climbing\nto fresh ﬁve-year highs in late 2014 early 2015. This level would have certainly\nattracted a number of top pickers. To the frustration of those who tried to fade\nthe move, USDCAD rallied 9% beyond its ﬁve-year highs, which means those top\npickers would have incurred signiﬁcant losses. Taking a look at the hourly chart for\nthe USDCAD, we want to look for opportunities to buy on dips rather than sell on\nrallies. Figure 8.4 shows Fibonacci retracement levels drawn from the 2002 to 2008\nbear wave. Those levels held pretty well with declines ﬁnding support at the 38.2%\nFibonacci retracements between January 2008, Janua ry 2009, and January 2015.\nMultiple time frame analysis can also be employed on a shorter-term basis. Let\nus take a look at an example using CHFJPY. First we start with the hourly chart\nof CHFJPY, shown in Figure 8.5. Using Fibonacci retracements, we can see on the\nhourly charts that prices have failed at the 38.2% retracement of the December 30,\n2004, to February 9, 2005, bear wave numerous times. This indicates that the\npair is contained within a weeklong downtrend below those levels. In this case,\nwe want to use our 15-minute charts to look for entry levels to participate in the\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS94\nFIGURE 8.3 USDCAD Weekly Chart\nSource: eSignal\noverall downtrend. However, in order to increase the successfulness of this trade,\nwe want to make sure that CHFJPY is also in a downtrend on a daily basis. Taking\na look at Figure 8.6, we can see that CHFJPY is indeed trading below the 200-day\nsimple moving average, with the 20-day SMA crossing below the 100-day SMA. This\nconﬁrms the bearish momentum in the currency pair. So as a day trader, we move to\nthe 15-minute chart to identify entry levels. Figure 8.7 is the 15-minute chart; the\nhorizontal line is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the earlier downtrend. We\nsee that CHFJPY broke above the horizontal line on May 11, 2005; however, rather\nthan buying into a potential breakout trade, the bearish big picture reﬂected on the\nhourly and daily charts point to a contrarian trade. In fact, there were two instances\nshown in Figure 8.7 where the currency pair broke above the Fibonacci level only\nto trade signiﬁcantly lower.

        "101CHAPTER 9\nTechnical Strategy:\nTrading with\nDouble Bollinger\nBands\nOne of the most useful technical indicators in my experience is Bollinger Bands.\nTraditionally, Bollinger Bands are used as overbought and oversold indicators,\nbut given the trending nature of currencies, there are more efﬁcient ways to use the\nbands. Traditionally, Bollinger Bands consists of three lines—the 20-period moving\naverage and the two standard deviation bands above and below the moving average.\nIf the currency pair rises to the upper Bollinger Band, it is considered overbought\nbecause the move extended to an extreme level and should therefore be faded. The\nsame is true if it drops to the lower Bollinger Band. Unfortunately, currencies are\ntrending, and using the 20-period two standard deviation bands may not be the best\nway to trade. Take a look at Figure 9.1. In this daily chart of EURUSD, the arrows\nhighlight the points where the currency pair ‘‘hugs’’ the second standard deviation\nband. If you bought each time EURUSD touched the lower band or sold each time it\ntouched the upper band, there would be signiﬁcant losses before the currency pair\nﬁnally turned around.\nThe better technique would be to add another set of Bollinger Bands—the 20-\nperiod, one-standard deviation. This would put four bands on the chart if the basis\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS102\nFIGURE 9.1 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS103or the 20-period moving average is removed, and most charting packages will allow\nyou to do that. Figure 9.2 shows how the same EURUSD daily chart with look with\ntwo sets of Bollinger Bands. The outer lines are the two-standard-deviation Bollinger\nBands, and the two inner lines are the one-standard-deviation Bollinger Bands.\n■Using Double Bollinger Bands to Pick Tops\nand Bottoms\nHaving two sets of Bollinger Bands on your chart is a much more effective way\nto pick a top or bottom in currencies. The general rule of thumb is that we don’t\nbuy a bottom until the currency pair has traded above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. Along the same lines, we do not sell a top until the pair trades\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. While this technique may not\npick the perfect bottom, it can help avoid prematurely picking a top or bottom\nwhich can mean major losses in a trending environment. Here are the rules for the\nlong and short trades on a daily chart for picking tops and bottoms using the double\nBollinger Bands.\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be trading between the lower ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, BUY at close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 50 pips below ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be tra ding between the upper ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 30 pips above ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nLets take a look at the same EURUSD chart. Figure 9.3 shows the points at which\na trade would have been entered, and in most cases, it was a more effective way to\npick a top or bottom in the currency pair.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS104\nFIGURE 9.2 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS\nk\nk105\nk\nk\nFIGURE 9.3 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS106\nFIGURE 9.4 EURUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nNow let’s take a look at some examples in more detail. In Figure 9.4, we see that\non May 18, the EURUSD, which had been trading between the two upper bands,\nfell strongly to break out of the zone and close below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. We sell at the NY close (there’s usually a leeway of two hours). A\ntwo-lot trade is established at 1.1313 with a stop 30 pips above the ﬁrst standard\ndeviation Bollinger Band (1.1341) at 1.1371. The risk is 58 pips, which means that\nthe ﬁrst exit is 1.1313 minus 58 pips or 1.1255. The second proﬁt target is 1.1197,\nwhich is two times risk or 116 pips. The ﬁrst and second proﬁt targets are reached\non the very next day when the currency pair drops to a low of 1.1119, for a proﬁt\nof 58 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and another 116 pips on the second half. If\nthe stop was trailed using a moving average or percentage, a trader may have been\nable to capitalize on th e selloff that ensued.\nFigure 9.5 shows that on June 2, the EURUSD, which had been trading between\nthe two lower bands, rose strongly to break out of the zone and close ﬁrmly above\nthe ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. We buy at the NY close (there’s usually\na leeway of two hours). A two-lot trade is e stablished at 1.1151, with a stop 30 pips\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band (1.0970) at 1.0940. The risk is 211\npips, which means that the ﬁrst exit is 1.1151 plus 211 pips, or 1.1361. This proﬁt\ntarget is reached two days later, when the currency pair races to a high of 1.1380.\nAt the time, the stop is moved to 1.1151, and the following day the breakeven stop\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS107\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nC u r r e n c y 1 MR / R 3 MR / R 6 MR / R 1 Y RR / R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 :IC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC. 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C =Japanese Yen Call * SC =Sterling Call\n*E C =Euro Call * CC =Swiss Call\n*S P =Sterling Put\nFIGURE 9.5 EURUSD Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nis hit, and we end up banking only +211 on the ﬁrst half of the trade with no losses\nor gains on the second half.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Determine Trend versus Range\nIn addition to identifying levels to pick tops and bottoms, the double Bollinger Bands\ncan also be very helpful in determining the market environment. One of the most\ncommonly asked questions in forex is whether a currency pair is in trend or range.\nWhen the pair is trading be tween the two lower or upper Bollinger Bands, it is in\ntrend, and when it is trading between the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Bands,\nit is in range, as shown in Figure 9.6. When the currency pair is in trend mode,\nit is best to look for opportunities to join the trend. When it is in the range zone,\npicking tops and bottoms is preferred.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Join a New Trend\nAnother way to use the double Bollinger Bands is to join a new uptrend or downtrend\nusing a daily chart. Here are the trading rules:\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, buyat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS108\nFIGURE 9.6 GBPUSD Bollinger Band Trend Range Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS109\nFIGURE 9.7 USDJPY Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 9.8 GBPUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS1105. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\n5. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nHere are some examples:\nIn Figure 9.7, we see that USDJPY closed above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band on May 18. We check to see if the last two candles were below the\nband and the rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a long trade at 119.97. The\nstop is placed 65 pips below at 119.32. The target for the ﬁrst half of the position is\n50 pips, or 120.47, and the target for the second half is 195 pips, or 121.92. The\nﬁrst proﬁt target is reached 24 hours later (which is generally the case). When that\nhappens, the stop is raised to 119.97, which is the initial entry or breakeven price.\nThe trade is left on and the second proﬁt target of +195 pips is reached six trading\ndays after the trade was ﬁrst initiated.\nIn Figure 9.8, we see GBPUSD close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand on March 4, so we check to see if the last two candles were above the band and\nthe rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a short trade at 5pm when the currency\npair is trading at 1.5263. The stop is placed 65 pips above at 1.5328. The target for\nthe ﬁrst half of the position is 50 pips, or 1.5213, and the target for the second half\nis 195 pips, or 1.5068. The trade ﬂoats for 24 hours, then GBPUSD drops sharply,\nhitting our ﬁrst and second proﬁt target on the very same day.\nWe encourage you to lay the Bollinger Bands on your charts and look for more\nexamples of these strategies in action. There are many ways to use the double\nBollinger Bands for forex trading. Both of these strategies are for daily charts, but\ndifferent strategies and rules can be used for intraday trading using the bands.\n111CHAPTER 10\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Fading\nthe Double Zeros\nOne of the most widely overlooked areas of trading is market structure.\nDeveloping a keen understanding of market structure and its dynamics\ncan help day traders to gain an unbelievable advantage. Developing a feel and\nunderstanding for market dynamics is key to proﬁtably taking advantage of short-\nterm ﬂuctuations. In foreign exchange trading this is especially critical as the primary\ninﬂuence of intraday price action is order ﬂow. Given the fact that most individual\ntraders are not privy to sell-side bank order ﬂow, day traders looking to proﬁt from\nshort-term ﬂuctuations need to learn how to identify and anticipate price zones\nwhere large order ﬂows should be triggered. This technique is very efﬁcient for\nintraday traders as it allows them to get on the same side as the market maker.\nWhen trading intraday, it is impossible to look for bounces off every support or\nresistance level and expect to be proﬁtable. The key to successful intraday trading\nrequires more selectivity and only entering at those levels where a reaction is more\nlikely. Trading off psychologically important levels such as the double zeros or round\nnumbers is one good way of identifying such opportunities. Double zeros represent\nnumbers where the last two digits are zeros. Examples of double zeros would be\n118.00in USDJPY or 1.11 00in the EURUSD. After noticing how many times a\ncurrency pair would bounce off double zero support or resistance levels intraday\ndespite the underlying trend, we have observed that these bounces are usually much\nlarger and more relevant that rallies off other price levels. This type of reaction is\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS112perfect for intraday FX traders because it gives them the opportunity to make 30 to\n50 pips while risking only 15–20 pips.\nThis trading technique is not difﬁcult, but it requires individual traders to develop\na solid feel for dealing room and market participant psychology. The idea behind this\ndouble zero methodology is simple. Large banks with access to conditional order\nﬂow have a distinct advantage over other market participants. The bank’s order book\ngives them direct insight into potential reactions at different price levels. Dealers\nwill often use this strategic information to put on short-term positions in their own\naccounts.\nMarket participants as a whole tend to put conditional orders near or around\nthe same levels. While stop-loss orders are usually placed just beyond the round\nnumbers, traders will cluster their take proﬁt orders at the round number. The\nreason why this occurs is because traders are humans, and humans tend to think in\nround numbers. As a result, take proﬁt orders have a very high tendency of being\nplaced at the double zero level. Since the FX market is a 24-hour continuous market,\nspeculators also use stop and limit orders more frequently than in other markets.\nLarge banks with access to conditional order ﬂow, like stops and limits, actively seek\nto exploit this clustering of positions to basically gun stops. The fading the double zero\nstrategy attempts to put traders on the same side as market makers by positioning\ntraders for a quick contra-trend move at the double zero level.\nThis trade is most proﬁtable when there are other technical indicators that will\nconﬁrm the signiﬁcance of the double zero level. Here are some guidelines for fading\nthe double zeros or ‘‘round numbers.’’\n■Strategy Rules\nLong:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading below its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Enter a long position 10 to 15 pips above the ﬁgure.\n3. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips below the ﬁgure.\na. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to\nbreakeven.\nb. Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nShort:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading above its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Short the currency pair 10 to 15 pips below the ﬁgure.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS1133. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips above the round number.\n4. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount that you risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to breakeven.\nTrail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nMarket Conditions\nThis strategy works best when the move happens in quieter market conditions\nwithout the inﬂuence of major reports. It is more successful for currency pairs with\ntighter trading ranges, crosses, and commodity currencies. This strategy also works\nin the majors but under quieter market conditions since the stop loss is relatively\ntight.\nFurther Optimization\nRound numbers are important because they are signiﬁcant levels but if the price\ncoincides with a key technical level, a reversal becomes more likely. This means the\nstrategy has an even higher probability of success when other important support or\nresistance levels converge at the ﬁgure. This can be caused by moving averages, key\nFibonacci levels or Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some of the examples of this strategy in action. The ﬁrst\nexample that we will go over is a 15-minute chart of USDJPY shown in Figure 10.1.\nAccording to the rules of the strategy, we can see that on April 24, USDJPY was\ntrading above its 20-period moving. Prices continued to move higher with the\ncurrency pair drifting toward 120.00, our double zero level. In accordance with the\nrules, we place an entry order a few pips below the round number at 1110.85. Our\norder is triggered, and we put our stop 20 above the ﬁgure at 120.20. USDJPY\nclimbs to a high of 120.08 before turning lower. We close half of the position when\nit moves by the amount risked or 35 pips at 1110.50. Notice that USDJPY falls and\nthen rallies again before hitting our initial proﬁt target. When the ﬁrst proﬁt target\nis reached, the stop on the remaining half of the position is moved to breakeven or\nour initial entry price of 1110.85.\nWe then proceed to trail stop. The trailing stop can be done using a variety of\nmethods including a monetary or percentage basis. We choose to trail the stop by\ntwo-bar low for a really short-term trade and end up getting out of the other half of\nthe position at 1110.50 as well, earning us 35 pips on the ﬁrst and second half of the\npositions.\nThe next chart that we want to look at is GBPUSD. What’s interesting about\nFigure 10.2 is that there are a number of examples. In the ﬁrst example, labeled ‘‘1,’’\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS114\nFIGURE 10.1 USDJPY 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 10.2 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS115we can see that GBP/USD was trading above its 20-period moving average on a\n15-minute chart and headed for 1.55. According to our rules, we place an order to\nsell at 1.5485 (the high on this move was 1.5492) with a stop at 1.5520 for 35-pip\nrisk. GBPUSD moves in our favor, and our ﬁrst proﬁt target is hit at (1.5485 –.0035)\nat 1.5450. We then move our stop to breakeven, or our initial entry price of 1.5485,\nand proceed to trail it by the 20-day SMA +10 pips. If we manage our trade using\nthis type of trailing stop, the second half of the position would have been exited\nat 1.5350 for 35 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and 135 pips on the second.\nPart of the reason why this trade was so successful is because the 1.5500 is also\na signiﬁcant technical level. Example ‘‘2’’ is a long trail that reversed but not by\nenough to hit the proﬁt target. Example ‘‘3’’ is a successful long trade that hit the ﬁrst\nproﬁt target.\nMaking sure that the double zero level is a signiﬁcant level is a key element of\nﬁltering for good trades. The last example shown in Figure 10.3 is USDCAD on a\n15-minute chart. The great thing about this trade is that it is triple zero level rather\nthan just a double zero level. Triple zero levels hold even more signiﬁcance than a\ndouble zero level because of their less frequent occurrence. In Figure 10.3, we see\nthat USDCAD is also trading well below its 20-period moving average and heading\ntoward 1.2000. We look to go long 15 pips above the double zero level at 1.2015.\nFIGURE 10.3 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS116We place our stop 20 pips below the round number at 1.1980. The currency pair\nhits a low of 1.2011 before moving higher. We then sell half of our positions when\nthe currency pair rallies by the amount that we risked at 1.2050. The stop on the\nremaining half of the position is then moved to breakeven at 1.2015. We proceed\nto trail the stop once again by the two-bar low and end up exiting the second half\nof the position at 1.2055. As a result, we earned 35 pips on the ﬁrst position and\n40 pips on the second position.\n117CHAPTER 11\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Waiting\nfor the Deal\nThe lack of volume data in the FX market has forced day traders to develop\ndifferent strategies that rely less on the level of demand and more on the micro\nstructure of the market. One of the most common characteristics that day traders\ntry to exploit is the market’s 24-hour round-the-clock nature. Although the market\nis open for trading throughout the course of the day, the extent of market activity\nduring each trading session can vary signiﬁcantly. Traditionally, trading tends to be\nthe quietest during the Asian market hours as we indicated in Chapter 4. This means\nthat currencies such as the EURUSD and GBPUSD tend to trade within a very\ntight range during these hours. According to the Bank of International Settlement’s\nTriennial FX Survey published in September of 2014, the United Kingdom is the\nmost active trading center, capturing 41% of total volume. Adding in Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Switzerland, European trading as a whole accounts for 50% of\ntotal FX trading. The United States, on the other hand, is only second to the\nUnited Kingdom for the title of most active trading center, but that amounts to only\napproximately 19% of total turnover. This makes the London open exceptionally\nimportant because it gives the majority of traders in the market an opportunity\nto take advantage of events or announcements that may have occurred during\nlate U.S. trading or overnight Asian sessions. This becomes even more critical on\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL118days when the FOMC meets to discuss and announce monetary policy because the\nannouncement occurs at 2:15pm NY Time, after the London close.\nThe British pound trades most actively against the U.S. dollar during the European\nand London trading hours. There is also active trading during the U.S./European\noverlap, but outside those time frames, the pair tends to trade relatively lightly\nbecause the majority of GBPUSD trading is done through UK and European market\nmakers. This provides a great opportunity for day traders to capture the initial\ndirectional intraday real move that occurs within the ﬁrst few hours of London\ntrading. This strategy exploits the common perception that UK traders are notorious\nstop hunters. This means that the initial movement at the London open may not\nalways be the real one. Since UK and European dealers are the primary market\nmakers for the GBPUSD, they have tremendous insight into the extent of actual\nsupply and demand for the pair. The ‘‘waiting for the real deal’’ trading strategy\nﬁrst sets up when interbank dealing desks survey their books at the onset of trading\nand use their client data to trigger close stops on both sides of the markets to gain\nthe pip differential. Once these stops are taken out and the books are cleared, the\nreal directional move in the GBPUSD will begin to occur, at which point we look\nfor the rules of this strategy to be met before entering into a long or short position.\nThis strategy works best following the U.S. open or after a major economic release.\nWith this strategy, you are looking for th e noise in the markets to settle before\ntrading the real trend of the day.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Early European trading in GBPUSD begins around 1am NY Time, and we look\nfor the pair to make new range low of at least 25 pips above the opening price\n(the range is deﬁned as t he price action between the Frankfurt and London\npower hour of 6 GMT to 7 GMT NY Time).\n2. Look for the pair to reverse and penetrate the high.\n3. Place an entry order to buy 10 pips above the high of the range.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range high, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nShorts:\n1. GBPUSD opens in Europe and trades more than 25 pips above the high\nestablished during the Frankfurt to London power hour.\n2. Wait for the pair to reverse and penetrate the low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL1193. When that occurs, place an entry order to sell 10 pips below the low of the\nrange.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range low, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some examples of this strategy in action. Figure 11.1 is\na textbook example of the ‘‘waiting for th e real deal’’ strategy. Between 6 and 7\nGMT, the range high and low for GBPUSD are 1.5359 and 1.5234, respectively. At\nthe start of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upwards, taking\nout the range high of 1.5359. At the time, we place an order to sell GBPUSD 10\npips below the range low at 1.5324. The entry is triggered about an hour and a half\nlater. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35 pips total) at\n1.5359. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5274, or 50 pips below\nthe entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven\nor 1.5324. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at 1.5219\nshortly after the NY open.\nFIGURE 11.1 GBPUSD 5-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL120\nFIGURE 11.2 GBPUSD 10-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 11.3 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL121The next example is shown in Figure 11.2. In this example, the range high and\nlow established between 6 and 7 GMT are 1 .5433 and 1.5399, resp ectively. At the\nstart of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upward, taking out\nthe range high of 1.5433 and racing all the way to 1.5492. At the time, we place an\norder to sell GBPUSD 10 pips below the range low at 1.5389. The entry is triggered\naround the NY open. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35\npips total) at 1.5424. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5339, or 50\npips below the entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to\nbreakeven or 1.5389. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at\n1.5284 after the London open on the following trading day.\nThe third example is shown in Figure 11.3. In this example, the range during the\nFrankfurt London power hour is 1.5187 and 1.5139. At the start of the London\ntrading session, GBPUSD drips lower, breaking below the range low and trading\ndown to 1.5105. When the range low is broken, we place an order to buy GBPUSD\n10 pips below the range high at 1.5197. The entry is triggered around the NY open.\nThe protective stop is placed 25 pips below the range high (35 pips total) at 1.5172.\nA take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5247, or 50 pips below the entry\nprice. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or 1.5197.\nThe second exit is not shown in the chart in Figure 11.3, but the breakeven stop is\ntriggered.",
        "101CHAPTER 9\nTechnical Strategy:\nTrading with\nDouble Bollinger\nBands\nOne of the most useful technical indicators in my experience is Bollinger Bands.\nTraditionally, Bollinger Bands are used as overbought and oversold indicators,\nbut given the trending nature of currencies, there are more efﬁcient ways to use the\nbands. Traditionally, Bollinger Bands consists of three lines—the 20-period moving\naverage and the two standard deviation bands above and below the moving average.\nIf the currency pair rises to the upper Bollinger Band, it is considered overbought\nbecause the move extended to an extreme level and should therefore be faded. The\nsame is true if it drops to the lower Bollinger Band. Unfortunately, currencies are\ntrending, and using the 20-period two standard deviation bands may not be the best\nway to trade. Take a look at Figure 9.1. In this daily chart of EURUSD, the arrows\nhighlight the points where the currency pair ‘‘hugs’’ the second standard deviation\nband. If you bought each time EURUSD touched the lower band or sold each time it\ntouched the upper band, there would be signiﬁcant losses before the currency pair\nﬁnally turned around.\nThe better technique would be to add another set of Bollinger Bands—the 20-\nperiod, one-standard deviation. This would put four bands on the chart if the basis\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS102\nFIGURE 9.1 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS103or the 20-period moving average is removed, and most charting packages will allow\nyou to do that. Figure 9.2 shows how the same EURUSD daily chart with look with\ntwo sets of Bollinger Bands. The outer lines are the two-standard-deviation Bollinger\nBands, and the two inner lines are the one-standard-deviation Bollinger Bands.\n■Using Double Bollinger Bands to Pick Tops\nand Bottoms\nHaving two sets of Bollinger Bands on your chart is a much more effective way\nto pick a top or bottom in currencies. The general rule of thumb is that we don’t\nbuy a bottom until the currency pair has traded above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. Along the same lines, we do not sell a top until the pair trades\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. While this technique may not\npick the perfect bottom, it can help avoid prematurely picking a top or bottom\nwhich can mean major losses in a trending environment. Here are the rules for the\nlong and short trades on a daily chart for picking tops and bottoms using the double\nBollinger Bands.\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be trading between the lower ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, BUY at close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 50 pips below ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be tra ding between the upper ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 30 pips above ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nLets take a look at the same EURUSD chart. Figure 9.3 shows the points at which\na trade would have been entered, and in most cases, it was a more effective way to\npick a top or bottom in the currency pair.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS104\nFIGURE 9.2 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS\nk\nk105\nk\nk\nFIGURE 9.3 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS106\nFIGURE 9.4 EURUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nNow let’s take a look at some examples in more detail. In Figure 9.4, we see that\non May 18, the EURUSD, which had been trading between the two upper bands,\nfell strongly to break out of the zone and close below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. We sell at the NY close (there’s usually a leeway of two hours). A\ntwo-lot trade is established at 1.1313 with a stop 30 pips above the ﬁrst standard\ndeviation Bollinger Band (1.1341) at 1.1371. The risk is 58 pips, which means that\nthe ﬁrst exit is 1.1313 minus 58 pips or 1.1255. The second proﬁt target is 1.1197,\nwhich is two times risk or 116 pips. The ﬁrst and second proﬁt targets are reached\non the very next day when the currency pair drops to a low of 1.1119, for a proﬁt\nof 58 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and another 116 pips on the second half. If\nthe stop was trailed using a moving average or percentage, a trader may have been\nable to capitalize on th e selloff that ensued.\nFigure 9.5 shows that on June 2, the EURUSD, which had been trading between\nthe two lower bands, rose strongly to break out of the zone and close ﬁrmly above\nthe ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. We buy at the NY close (there’s usually\na leeway of two hours). A two-lot trade is e stablished at 1.1151, with a stop 30 pips\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band (1.0970) at 1.0940. The risk is 211\npips, which means that the ﬁrst exit is 1.1151 plus 211 pips, or 1.1361. This proﬁt\ntarget is reached two days later, when the currency pair races to a high of 1.1380.\nAt the time, the stop is moved to 1.1151, and the following day the breakeven stop\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS107\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nC u r r e n c y 1 MR / R 3 MR / R 6 MR / R 1 Y RR / R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 :IC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC. 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C =Japanese Yen Call * SC =Sterling Call\n*E C =Euro Call * CC =Swiss Call\n*S P =Sterling Put\nFIGURE 9.5 EURUSD Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nis hit, and we end up banking only +211 on the ﬁrst half of the trade with no losses\nor gains on the second half.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Determine Trend versus Range\nIn addition to identifying levels to pick tops and bottoms, the double Bollinger Bands\ncan also be very helpful in determining the market environment. One of the most\ncommonly asked questions in forex is whether a currency pair is in trend or range.\nWhen the pair is trading be tween the two lower or upper Bollinger Bands, it is in\ntrend, and when it is trading between the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Bands,\nit is in range, as shown in Figure 9.6. When the currency pair is in trend mode,\nit is best to look for opportunities to join the trend. When it is in the range zone,\npicking tops and bottoms is preferred.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Join a New Trend\nAnother way to use the double Bollinger Bands is to join a new uptrend or downtrend\nusing a daily chart. Here are the trading rules:\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, buyat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS108\nFIGURE 9.6 GBPUSD Bollinger Band Trend Range Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS109\nFIGURE 9.7 USDJPY Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 9.8 GBPUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS1105. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\n5. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nHere are some examples:\nIn Figure 9.7, we see that USDJPY closed above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band on May 18. We check to see if the last two candles were below the\nband and the rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a long trade at 119.97. The\nstop is placed 65 pips below at 119.32. The target for the ﬁrst half of the position is\n50 pips, or 120.47, and the target for the second half is 195 pips, or 121.92. The\nﬁrst proﬁt target is reached 24 hours later (which is generally the case). When that\nhappens, the stop is raised to 119.97, which is the initial entry or breakeven price.\nThe trade is left on and the second proﬁt target of +195 pips is reached six trading\ndays after the trade was ﬁrst initiated.\nIn Figure 9.8, we see GBPUSD close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand on March 4, so we check to see if the last two candles were above the band and\nthe rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a short trade at 5pm when the currency\npair is trading at 1.5263. The stop is placed 65 pips above at 1.5328. The target for\nthe ﬁrst half of the position is 50 pips, or 1.5213, and the target for the second half\nis 195 pips, or 1.5068. The trade ﬂoats for 24 hours, then GBPUSD drops sharply,\nhitting our ﬁrst and second proﬁt target on the very same day.\nWe encourage you to lay the Bollinger Bands on your charts and look for more\nexamples of these strategies in action. There are many ways to use the double\nBollinger Bands for forex trading. Both of these strategies are for daily charts, but\ndifferent strategies and rules can be used for intraday trading using the bands.\n111CHAPTER 10\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Fading\nthe Double Zeros\nOne of the most widely overlooked areas of trading is market structure.\nDeveloping a keen understanding of market structure and its dynamics\ncan help day traders to gain an unbelievable advantage. Developing a feel and\nunderstanding for market dynamics is key to proﬁtably taking advantage of short-\nterm ﬂuctuations. In foreign exchange trading this is especially critical as the primary\ninﬂuence of intraday price action is order ﬂow. Given the fact that most individual\ntraders are not privy to sell-side bank order ﬂow, day traders looking to proﬁt from\nshort-term ﬂuctuations need to learn how to identify and anticipate price zones\nwhere large order ﬂows should be triggered. This technique is very efﬁcient for\nintraday traders as it allows them to get on the same side as the market maker.\nWhen trading intraday, it is impossible to look for bounces off every support or\nresistance level and expect to be proﬁtable. The key to successful intraday trading\nrequires more selectivity and only entering at those levels where a reaction is more\nlikely. Trading off psychologically important levels such as the double zeros or round\nnumbers is one good way of identifying such opportunities. Double zeros represent\nnumbers where the last two digits are zeros. Examples of double zeros would be\n118.00in USDJPY or 1.11 00in the EURUSD. After noticing how many times a\ncurrency pair would bounce off double zero support or resistance levels intraday\ndespite the underlying trend, we have observed that these bounces are usually much\nlarger and more relevant that rallies off other price levels. This type of reaction is\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS112perfect for intraday FX traders because it gives them the opportunity to make 30 to\n50 pips while risking only 15–20 pips.\nThis trading technique is not difﬁcult, but it requires individual traders to develop\na solid feel for dealing room and market participant psychology. The idea behind this\ndouble zero methodology is simple. Large banks with access to conditional order\nﬂow have a distinct advantage over other market participants. The bank’s order book\ngives them direct insight into potential reactions at different price levels. Dealers\nwill often use this strategic information to put on short-term positions in their own\naccounts.\nMarket participants as a whole tend to put conditional orders near or around\nthe same levels. While stop-loss orders are usually placed just beyond the round\nnumbers, traders will cluster their take proﬁt orders at the round number. The\nreason why this occurs is because traders are humans, and humans tend to think in\nround numbers. As a result, take proﬁt orders have a very high tendency of being\nplaced at the double zero level. Since the FX market is a 24-hour continuous market,\nspeculators also use stop and limit orders more frequently than in other markets.\nLarge banks with access to conditional order ﬂow, like stops and limits, actively seek\nto exploit this clustering of positions to basically gun stops. The fading the double zero\nstrategy attempts to put traders on the same side as market makers by positioning\ntraders for a quick contra-trend move at the double zero level.\nThis trade is most proﬁtable when there are other technical indicators that will\nconﬁrm the signiﬁcance of the double zero level. Here are some guidelines for fading\nthe double zeros or ‘‘round numbers.’’\n■Strategy Rules\nLong:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading below its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Enter a long position 10 to 15 pips above the ﬁgure.\n3. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips below the ﬁgure.\na. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to\nbreakeven.\nb. Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nShort:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading above its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Short the currency pair 10 to 15 pips below the ﬁgure.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS1133. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips above the round number.\n4. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount that you risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to breakeven.\nTrail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nMarket Conditions\nThis strategy works best when the move happens in quieter market conditions\nwithout the inﬂuence of major reports. It is more successful for currency pairs with\ntighter trading ranges, crosses, and commodity currencies. This strategy also works\nin the majors but under quieter market conditions since the stop loss is relatively\ntight.\nFurther Optimization\nRound numbers are important because they are signiﬁcant levels but if the price\ncoincides with a key technical level, a reversal becomes more likely. This means the\nstrategy has an even higher probability of success when other important support or\nresistance levels converge at the ﬁgure. This can be caused by moving averages, key\nFibonacci levels or Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some of the examples of this strategy in action. The ﬁrst\nexample that we will go over is a 15-minute chart of USDJPY shown in Figure 10.1.\nAccording to the rules of the strategy, we can see that on April 24, USDJPY was\ntrading above its 20-period moving. Prices continued to move higher with the\ncurrency pair drifting toward 120.00, our double zero level. In accordance with the\nrules, we place an entry order a few pips below the round number at 1110.85. Our\norder is triggered, and we put our stop 20 above the ﬁgure at 120.20. USDJPY\nclimbs to a high of 120.08 before turning lower. We close half of the position when\nit moves by the amount risked or 35 pips at 1110.50. Notice that USDJPY falls and\nthen rallies again before hitting our initial proﬁt target. When the ﬁrst proﬁt target\nis reached, the stop on the remaining half of the position is moved to breakeven or\nour initial entry price of 1110.85.\nWe then proceed to trail stop. The trailing stop can be done using a variety of\nmethods including a monetary or percentage basis. We choose to trail the stop by\ntwo-bar low for a really short-term trade and end up getting out of the other half of\nthe position at 1110.50 as well, earning us 35 pips on the ﬁrst and second half of the\npositions.\nThe next chart that we want to look at is GBPUSD. What’s interesting about\nFigure 10.2 is that there are a number of examples. In the ﬁrst example, labeled ‘‘1,’’\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS114\nFIGURE 10.1 USDJPY 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 10.2 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS115we can see that GBP/USD was trading above its 20-period moving average on a\n15-minute chart and headed for 1.55. According to our rules, we place an order to\nsell at 1.5485 (the high on this move was 1.5492) with a stop at 1.5520 for 35-pip\nrisk. GBPUSD moves in our favor, and our ﬁrst proﬁt target is hit at (1.5485 –.0035)\nat 1.5450. We then move our stop to breakeven, or our initial entry price of 1.5485,\nand proceed to trail it by the 20-day SMA +10 pips. If we manage our trade using\nthis type of trailing stop, the second half of the position would have been exited\nat 1.5350 for 35 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and 135 pips on the second.\nPart of the reason why this trade was so successful is because the 1.5500 is also\na signiﬁcant technical level. Example ‘‘2’’ is a long trail that reversed but not by\nenough to hit the proﬁt target. Example ‘‘3’’ is a successful long trade that hit the ﬁrst\nproﬁt target.\nMaking sure that the double zero level is a signiﬁcant level is a key element of\nﬁltering for good trades. The last example shown in Figure 10.3 is USDCAD on a\n15-minute chart. The great thing about this trade is that it is triple zero level rather\nthan just a double zero level. Triple zero levels hold even more signiﬁcance than a\ndouble zero level because of their less frequent occurrence. In Figure 10.3, we see\nthat USDCAD is also trading well below its 20-period moving average and heading\ntoward 1.2000. We look to go long 15 pips above the double zero level at 1.2015.\nFIGURE 10.3 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS116We place our stop 20 pips below the round number at 1.1980. The currency pair\nhits a low of 1.2011 before moving higher. We then sell half of our positions when\nthe currency pair rallies by the amount that we risked at 1.2050. The stop on the\nremaining half of the position is then moved to breakeven at 1.2015. We proceed\nto trail the stop once again by the two-bar low and end up exiting the second half\nof the position at 1.2055. As a result, we earned 35 pips on the ﬁrst position and\n40 pips on the second position.\n117CHAPTER 11\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Waiting\nfor the Deal\nThe lack of volume data in the FX market has forced day traders to develop\ndifferent strategies that rely less on the level of demand and more on the micro\nstructure of the market. One of the most common characteristics that day traders\ntry to exploit is the market’s 24-hour round-the-clock nature. Although the market\nis open for trading throughout the course of the day, the extent of market activity\nduring each trading session can vary signiﬁcantly. Traditionally, trading tends to be\nthe quietest during the Asian market hours as we indicated in Chapter 4. This means\nthat currencies such as the EURUSD and GBPUSD tend to trade within a very\ntight range during these hours. According to the Bank of International Settlement’s\nTriennial FX Survey published in September of 2014, the United Kingdom is the\nmost active trading center, capturing 41% of total volume. Adding in Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Switzerland, European trading as a whole accounts for 50% of\ntotal FX trading. The United States, on the other hand, is only second to the\nUnited Kingdom for the title of most active trading center, but that amounts to only\napproximately 19% of total turnover. This makes the London open exceptionally\nimportant because it gives the majority of traders in the market an opportunity\nto take advantage of events or announcements that may have occurred during\nlate U.S. trading or overnight Asian sessions. This becomes even more critical on\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL118days when the FOMC meets to discuss and announce monetary policy because the\nannouncement occurs at 2:15pm NY Time, after the London close.\nThe British pound trades most actively against the U.S. dollar during the European\nand London trading hours. There is also active trading during the U.S./European\noverlap, but outside those time frames, the pair tends to trade relatively lightly\nbecause the majority of GBPUSD trading is done through UK and European market\nmakers. This provides a great opportunity for day traders to capture the initial\ndirectional intraday real move that occurs within the ﬁrst few hours of London\ntrading. This strategy exploits the common perception that UK traders are notorious\nstop hunters. This means that the initial movement at the London open may not\nalways be the real one. Since UK and European dealers are the primary market\nmakers for the GBPUSD, they have tremendous insight into the extent of actual\nsupply and demand for the pair. The ‘‘waiting for the real deal’’ trading strategy\nﬁrst sets up when interbank dealing desks survey their books at the onset of trading\nand use their client data to trigger close stops on both sides of the markets to gain\nthe pip differential. Once these stops are taken out and the books are cleared, the\nreal directional move in the GBPUSD will begin to occur, at which point we look\nfor the rules of this strategy to be met before entering into a long or short position.\nThis strategy works best following the U.S. open or after a major economic release.\nWith this strategy, you are looking for th e noise in the markets to settle before\ntrading the real trend of the day.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Early European trading in GBPUSD begins around 1am NY Time, and we look\nfor the pair to make new range low of at least 25 pips above the opening price\n(the range is deﬁned as t he price action between the Frankfurt and London\npower hour of 6 GMT to 7 GMT NY Time).\n2. Look for the pair to reverse and penetrate the high.\n3. Place an entry order to buy 10 pips above the high of the range.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range high, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nShorts:\n1. GBPUSD opens in Europe and trades more than 25 pips above the high\nestablished during the Frankfurt to London power hour.\n2. Wait for the pair to reverse and penetrate the low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL1193. When that occurs, place an entry order to sell 10 pips below the low of the\nrange.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range low, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some examples of this strategy in action. Figure 11.1 is\na textbook example of the ‘‘waiting for th e real deal’’ strategy. Between 6 and 7\nGMT, the range high and low for GBPUSD are 1.5359 and 1.5234, respectively. At\nthe start of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upwards, taking\nout the range high of 1.5359. At the time, we place an order to sell GBPUSD 10\npips below the range low at 1.5324. The entry is triggered about an hour and a half\nlater. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35 pips total) at\n1.5359. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5274, or 50 pips below\nthe entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven\nor 1.5324. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at 1.5219\nshortly after the NY open.\nFIGURE 11.1 GBPUSD 5-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL120\nFIGURE 11.2 GBPUSD 10-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 11.3 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL121The next example is shown in Figure 11.2. In this example, the range high and\nlow established between 6 and 7 GMT are 1 .5433 and 1.5399, resp ectively. At the\nstart of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upward, taking out\nthe range high of 1.5433 and racing all the way to 1.5492. At the time, we place an\norder to sell GBPUSD 10 pips below the range low at 1.5389. The entry is triggered\naround the NY open. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35\npips total) at 1.5424. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5339, or 50\npips below the entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to\nbreakeven or 1.5389. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at\n1.5284 after the London open on the following trading day.\nThe third example is shown in Figure 11.3. In this example, the range during the\nFrankfurt London power hour is 1.5187 and 1.5139. At the start of the London\ntrading session, GBPUSD drips lower, breaking below the range low and trading\ndown to 1.5105. When the range low is broken, we place an order to buy GBPUSD\n10 pips below the range high at 1.5197. The entry is triggered around the NY open.\nThe protective stop is placed 25 pips below the range high (35 pips total) at 1.5172.\nA take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5247, or 50 pips below the entry\nprice. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or 1.5197.\nThe second exit is not shown in the chart in Figure 11.3, but the breakeven stop is\ntriggered."

        "101CHAPTER 9\nTechnical Strategy:\nTrading with\nDouble Bollinger\nBands\nOne of the most useful technical indicators in my experience is Bollinger Bands.\nTraditionally, Bollinger Bands are used as overbought and oversold indicators,\nbut given the trending nature of currencies, there are more efﬁcient ways to use the\nbands. Traditionally, Bollinger Bands consists of three lines—the 20-period moving\naverage and the two standard deviation bands above and below the moving average.\nIf the currency pair rises to the upper Bollinger Band, it is considered overbought\nbecause the move extended to an extreme level and should therefore be faded. The\nsame is true if it drops to the lower Bollinger Band. Unfortunately, currencies are\ntrending, and using the 20-period two standard deviation bands may not be the best\nway to trade. Take a look at Figure 9.1. In this daily chart of EURUSD, the arrows\nhighlight the points where the currency pair ‘‘hugs’’ the second standard deviation\nband. If you bought each time EURUSD touched the lower band or sold each time it\ntouched the upper band, there would be signiﬁcant losses before the currency pair\nﬁnally turned around.\nThe better technique would be to add another set of Bollinger Bands—the 20-\nperiod, one-standard deviation.

Figure 9.2 shows how the same EURUSD daily chart with look with\ntwo sets of Bollinger Bands. The outer lines are the two-standard-deviation Bollinger\nBands, and the two inner lines are the one-standard-deviation Bollinger Bands.\n■Using Double Bollinger Bands to Pick Tops\nand Bottoms\nHaving two sets of Bollinger Bands on your chart is a much more effective way\nto pick a top or bottom in currencies. The general rule of thumb is that we don’t\nbuy a bottom until the currency pair has traded above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. Along the same lines, we do not sell a top until the pair trades\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. While this technique may not\npick the perfect bottom, it can help avoid prematurely picking a top or bottom\nwhich can mean major losses in a trending environment. Here are the rules for the\nlong and short trades on a daily chart for picking tops and bottoms using the double\nBollinger Bands.\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be trading between the lower ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, BUY at close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 50 pips below ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be tra ding between the upper ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 30 pips above ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nLets take a look at the same EURUSD chart. Figure 9.3 shows the points at which\na trade would have been entered, and in most cases, it was a more effective way to\npick a top or bottom in the currency pair.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS104\nFIGURE 9.2 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS\nk\nk105\nk\nk\nFIGURE 9.3 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS106\nFIGURE 9.4 EURUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nNow let’s take a look at some examples in more detail. In Figure 9.4, we see that\non May 18, the EURUSD, which had been trading between the two upper bands,\nfell strongly to break out of the zone and close below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. We sell at the NY close (there’s usually a leeway of two hours). A\ntwo-lot trade is established at 1.1313 with a stop 30 pips above the ﬁrst standard\ndeviation Bollinger Band (1.1341) at 1.1371. The risk is 58 pips, which means that\nthe ﬁrst exit is 1.1313 minus 58 pips or 1.1255. The second proﬁt target is 1.1197,\nwhich is two times risk or 116 pips. The ﬁrst and second proﬁt targets are reached\non the very next day when the currency pair drops to a low of 1.1119, for a proﬁt\nof 58 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and another 116 pips on the second half. If\nthe stop was trailed using a moving average or percentage, a trader may have been\nable to capitalize on th e selloff that ensued.\nFigure 9.5 shows that on June 2, the EURUSD, which had been trading between\nthe two lower bands, rose strongly to break out of the zone and close ﬁrmly above\nthe ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. We buy at the NY close (there’s usually\na leeway of two hours). A two-lot trade is e stablished at 1.1151, with a stop 30 pips\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band (1.0970) at 1.0940. The risk is 211\npips, which means that the ﬁrst exit is 1.1151 plus 211 pips, or 1.1361. This proﬁt\ntarget is reached two days later, when the currency pair races to a high of 1.1380.\nAt the time, the stop is moved to 1.1151, and the following day the breakeven stop\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS107\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nC u r r e n c y 1 MR / R 3 MR / R 6 MR / R 1 Y RR / R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 :IC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC. 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C =Japanese Yen Call * SC =Sterling Call\n*E C =Euro Call * CC =Swiss Call\n*S P =Sterling Put\nFIGURE 9.5 EURUSD Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nis hit, and we end up banking only +211 on the ﬁrst half of the trade with no losses\nor gains on the second half.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Determine Trend versus Range\nIn addition to identifying levels to pick tops and bottoms, the double Bollinger Bands\ncan also be very helpful in determining the market environment. One of the most\ncommonly asked questions in forex is whether a currency pair is in trend or range.\nWhen the pair is trading be tween the two lower or upper Bollinger Bands, it is in\ntrend, and when it is trading between the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Bands,\nit is in range, as shown in Figure 9.6. When the currency pair is in trend mode,\nit is best to look for opportunities to join the trend. When it is in the range zone,\npicking tops and bottoms is preferred.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Join a New Trend\nAnother way to use the double Bollinger Bands is to join a new uptrend or downtrend\nusing a daily chart. Here are the trading rules:\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, buyat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4.

Look for the currency pair to close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3.

Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nHere are some examples:\nIn Figure 9.7, we see that USDJPY closed above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band on May 18. We check to see if the last two candles were below the\nband and the rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a long trade at 119.97. The\nstop is placed 65 pips below at 119.32. The target for the ﬁrst half of the position is\n50 pips, or 120.47, and the target for the second half is 195 pips, or 121.92. The\nﬁrst proﬁt target is reached 24 hours later (which is generally the case). When that\nhappens, the stop is raised to 119.97, which is the initial entry or breakeven price.\nThe trade is left on and the second proﬁt target of +195 pips is reached six trading\ndays after the trade was ﬁrst initiated.\nIn Figure 9.8, we see GBPUSD close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand on March 4, so we check to see if the last two candles were above the band and\nthe rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a short trade at 5pm when the currency\npair is trading at 1.5263. The stop is placed 65 pips above at 1.5328. The target for\nthe ﬁrst half of the position is 50 pips, or 1.5213, and the target for the second half\nis 195 pips, or 1.5068. The trade ﬂoats for 24 hours, then GBPUSD drops sharply,\nhitting our ﬁrst and second proﬁt target on the very same day.\nWe encourage you to lay the Bollinger Bands on your charts and look for more\nexamples of these strategies in action. There are many ways to use the double\nBollinger Bands for forex trading. Both of these strategies are for daily charts, but\ndifferent strategies and rules can be used for intraday trading using the bands.\n111CHAPTER 10\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Fading\nthe Double Zeros\nOne of the most widely overlooked areas of trading is market structure.\nDeveloping a keen understanding of market structure and its dynamics\ncan help day traders to gain an unbelievable advantage. Developing a feel and\nunderstanding for market dynamics is key to proﬁtably taking advantage of short-\nterm ﬂuctuations. In foreign exchange trading this is especially critical as the primary\ninﬂuence of intraday price action is order ﬂow. Given the fact that most individual\ntraders are not privy to sell-side bank order ﬂow, day traders looking to proﬁt from\nshort-term ﬂuctuations need to learn how to identify and anticipate price zones\nwhere large order ﬂows should be triggered. This technique is very efﬁcient for\nintraday traders as it allows them to get on the same side as the market maker.\nWhen trading intraday, it is impossible to look for bounces off every support or\nresistance level and expect to be proﬁtable. The key to successful intraday trading\nrequires more selectivity and only entering at those levels where a reaction is more\nlikely. Trading off psychologically important levels such as the double zeros or round\nnumbers is one good way of identifying such opportunities. Double zeros represent\nnumbers where the last two digits are zeros. Examples of double zeros would be\n118.00in USDJPY or 1.11 00in the EURUSD. After noticing how many times a\ncurrency pair would bounce off double zero support or resistance levels intraday\ndespite the underlying trend, we have observed that these bounces are usually much\nlarger and more relevant that rallies off other price levels. This type of reaction is\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS112perfect for intraday FX traders because it gives them the opportunity to make 30 to\n50 pips while risking only 15–20 pips.\nThis trading technique is not difﬁcult, but it requires individual traders to develop\na solid feel for dealing room and market participant psychology. The idea behind this\ndouble zero methodology is simple. Large banks with access to conditional order\nﬂow have a distinct advantage over other market participants. The bank’s order book\ngives them direct insight into potential reactions at different price levels. Dealers\nwill often use this strategic information to put on short-term positions in their own\naccounts.\nMarket participants as a whole tend to put conditional orders near or around\nthe same levels. While stop-loss orders are usually placed just beyond the round\nnumbers, traders will cluster their take proﬁt orders at the round number. The\nreason why this occurs is because traders are humans, and humans tend to think in\nround numbers. As a result, take proﬁt orders have a very high tendency of being\nplaced at the double zero level. Since the FX market is a 24-hour continuous market,\nspeculators also use stop and limit orders more frequently than in other markets.\nLarge banks with access to conditional order ﬂow, like stops and limits, actively seek\nto exploit this clustering of positions to basically gun stops. The fading the double zero\nstrategy attempts to put traders on the same side as market makers by positioning\ntraders for a quick contra-trend move at the double zero level.\nThis trade is most proﬁtable when there are other technical indicators that will\nconﬁrm the signiﬁcance of the double zero level. Here are some guidelines for fading\nthe double zeros or ‘‘round numbers.’’\n■Strategy Rules\nLong:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading below its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Enter a long position 10 to 15 pips above the ﬁgure.\n3. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips below the ﬁgure.\na. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to\nbreakeven.\nb. Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nShort:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading above its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Short the currency pair 10 to 15 pips below the ﬁgure.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS1133. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips above the round number.\n4. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount that you risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to breakeven.\nTrail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nMarket Conditions\nThis strategy works best when the move happens in quieter market conditions\nwithout the inﬂuence of major reports. It is more successful for currency pairs with\ntighter trading ranges, crosses, and commodity currencies. This strategy also works\nin the majors but under quieter market conditions since the stop loss is relatively\ntight.\nFurther Optimization\nRound numbers are important because they are signiﬁcant levels but if the price\ncoincides with a key technical level, a reversal becomes more likely. This means the\nstrategy has an even higher probability of success when other important support or\nresistance levels converge at the ﬁgure. This can be caused by moving averages, key\nFibonacci levels or Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some of the examples of this strategy in action. The ﬁrst\nexample that we will go over is a 15-minute chart of USDJPY shown in Figure 10.1.\nAccording to the rules of the strategy, we can see that on April 24, USDJPY was\ntrading above its 20-period moving. Prices continued to move higher with the\ncurrency pair drifting toward 120.00, our double zero level. In accordance with the\nrules, we place an entry order a few pips below the round number at 1110.85. Our\norder is triggered, and we put our stop 20 above the ﬁgure at 120.20. USDJPY\nclimbs to a high of 120.08 before turning lower. We close half of the position when\nit moves by the amount risked or 35 pips at 1110.50. Notice that USDJPY falls and\nthen rallies again before hitting our initial proﬁt target. When the ﬁrst proﬁt target\nis reached, the stop on the remaining half of the position is moved to breakeven or\nour initial entry price of 1110.85.\nWe then proceed to trail stop. The trailing stop can be done using a variety of\nmethods including a monetary or percentage basis. We choose to trail the stop by\ntwo-bar low for a really short-term trade and end up getting out of the other half of\nthe position at 1110.50 as well, earning us 35 pips on the ﬁrst and second half of the\npositions.\nThe next chart that we want to look at is GBPUSD. What’s interesting about\nFigure 10.2 is that there are a number of examples. In the ﬁrst example, labeled ‘‘1,’’\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS114\nFIGURE 10.1 USDJPY 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 10.2 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS115we can see that GBP/USD was trading above its 20-period moving average on a\n15-minute chart and headed for 1.55. According to our rules, we place an order to\nsell at 1.5485 (the high on this move was 1.5492) with a stop at 1.5520 for 35-pip\nrisk. GBPUSD moves in our favor, and our ﬁrst proﬁt target is hit at (1.5485 –.0035)\nat 1.5450. We then move our stop to breakeven, or our initial entry price of 1.5485,\nand proceed to trail it by the 20-day SMA +10 pips. If we manage our trade using\nthis type of trailing stop, the second half of the position would have been exited\nat 1.5350 for 35 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and 135 pips on the second.\nPart of the reason why this trade was so successful is because the 1.5500 is also\na signiﬁcant technical level. Example ‘‘2’’ is a long trail that reversed but not by\nenough to hit the proﬁt target. Example ‘‘3’’ is a successful long trade that hit the ﬁrst\nproﬁt target.\nMaking sure that the double zero level is a signiﬁcant level is a key element of\nﬁltering for good trades. The last example shown in Figure 10.3 is USDCAD on a\n15-minute chart. The great thing about this trade is that it is triple zero level rather\nthan just a double zero level. Triple zero levels hold even more signiﬁcance than a\ndouble zero level because of their less frequent occurrence. In Figure 10.3, we see\nthat USDCAD is also trading well below its 20-period moving average and heading\ntoward 1.2000. We look to go long 15 pips above the double zero level at 1.2015.\nFIGURE 10.3 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS116We place our stop 20 pips below the round number at 1.1980. The currency pair\nhits a low of 1.2011 before moving higher. We then sell half of our positions when\nthe currency pair rallies by the amount that we risked at 1.2050. The stop on the\nremaining half of the position is then moved to breakeven at 1.2015. We proceed\nto trail the stop once again by the two-bar low and end up exiting the second half\nof the position at 1.2055. As a result, we earned 35 pips on the ﬁrst position and\n40 pips on the second position.\n117CHAPTER 11\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Waiting\nfor the Deal\nThe lack of volume data in the FX market has forced day traders to develop\ndifferent strategies that rely less on the level of demand and more on the micro\nstructure of the market. One of the most common characteristics that day traders\ntry to exploit is the market’s 24-hour round-the-clock nature. Although the market\nis open for trading throughout the course of the day, the extent of market activity\nduring each trading session can vary signiﬁcantly. Traditionally, trading tends to be\nthe quietest during the Asian market hours as we indicated in Chapter 4. This means\nthat currencies such as the EURUSD and GBPUSD tend to trade within a very\ntight range during these hours. According to the Bank of International Settlement’s\nTriennial FX Survey published in September of 2014, the United Kingdom is the\nmost active trading center, capturing 41% of total volume. Adding in Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Switzerland, European trading as a whole accounts for 50% of\ntotal FX trading. The United States, on the other hand, is only second to the\nUnited Kingdom for the title of most active trading center, but that amounts to only\napproximately 19% of total turnover. This makes the London open exceptionally\nimportant because it gives the majority of traders in the market an opportunity\nto take advantage of events or announcements that may have occurred during\nlate U.S. trading or overnight Asian sessions. This becomes even more critical on\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL118days when the FOMC meets to discuss and announce monetary policy because the\nannouncement occurs at 2:15pm NY Time, after the London close.\nThe British pound trades most actively against the U.S. dollar during the European\nand London trading hours. There is also active trading during the U.S./European\noverlap, but outside those time frames, the pair tends to trade relatively lightly\nbecause the majority of GBPUSD trading is done through UK and European market\nmakers. This provides a great opportunity for day traders to capture the initial\ndirectional intraday real move that occurs within the ﬁrst few hours of London\ntrading. This strategy exploits the common perception that UK traders are notorious\nstop hunters. This means that the initial movement at the London open may not\nalways be the real one. Since UK and European dealers are the primary market\nmakers for the GBPUSD, they have tremendous insight into the extent of actual\nsupply and demand for the pair. The ‘‘waiting for the real deal’’ trading strategy\nﬁrst sets up when interbank dealing desks survey their books at the onset of trading\nand use their client data to trigger close stops on both sides of the markets to gain\nthe pip differential. Once these stops are taken out and the books are cleared, the\nreal directional move in the GBPUSD will begin to occur, at which point we look\nfor the rules of this strategy to be met before entering into a long or short position.\nThis strategy works best following the U.S. open or after a major economic release.\nWith this strategy, you are looking for th e noise in the markets to settle before\ntrading the real trend of the day.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Early European trading in GBPUSD begins around 1am NY Time, and we look\nfor the pair to make new range low of at least 25 pips above the opening price\n(the range is deﬁned as t he price action between the Frankfurt and London\npower hour of 6 GMT to 7 GMT NY Time).\n2. Look for the pair to reverse and penetrate the high.\n3. Place an entry order to buy 10 pips above the high of the range.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range high, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nShorts:\n1. GBPUSD opens in Europe and trades more than 25 pips above the high\nestablished during the Frankfurt to London power hour.\n2. Wait for the pair to reverse and penetrate the low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL1193. When that occurs, place an entry order to sell 10 pips below the low of the\nrange.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range low, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some examples of this strategy in action. Figure 11.1 is\na textbook example of the ‘‘waiting for th e real deal’’ strategy. Between 6 and 7\nGMT, the range high and low for GBPUSD are 1.5359 and 1.5234, respectively. At\nthe start of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upwards, taking\nout the range high of 1.5359. At the time, we place an order to sell GBPUSD 10\npips below the range low at 1.5324. The entry is triggered about an hour and a half\nlater. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35 pips total) at\n1.5359. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5274, or 50 pips below\nthe entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven\nor 1.5324. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at 1.5219\nshortly after the NY open.\nFIGURE 11.1 GBPUSD 5-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL120\nFIGURE 11.2 GBPUSD 10-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 11.3 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL121The next example is shown in Figure 11.2. In this example, the range high and\nlow established between 6 and 7 GMT are 1 .5433 and 1.5399, resp ectively. At the\nstart of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upward, taking out\nthe range high of 1.5433 and racing all the way to 1.5492. At the time, we place an\norder to sell GBPUSD 10 pips below the range low at 1.5389. The entry is triggered\naround the NY open. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35\npips total) at 1.5424. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5339, or 50\npips below the entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to\nbreakeven or 1.5389. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at\n1.5284 after the London open on the following trading day.\nThe third example is shown in Figure 11.3. In this example, the range during the\nFrankfurt London power hour is 1.5187 and 1.5139. At the start of the London\ntrading session, GBPUSD drips lower, breaking below the range low and trading\ndown to 1.5105. When the range low is broken, we place an order to buy GBPUSD\n10 pips below the range high at 1.5197. The entry is triggered around the NY open.\nThe protective stop is placed 25 pips below the range high (35 pips total) at 1.5172.\nA take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5247, or 50 pips below the entry\nprice. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or 1.5197.\nThe second exit is not shown in the chart in Figure 11.3, but the breakeven stop is\ntriggered.",
        "101CHAPTER 9\nTechnical Strategy:\nTrading with\nDouble Bollinger\nBands\nOne of the most useful technical indicators in my experience is Bollinger Bands.\nTraditionally, Bollinger Bands are used as overbought and oversold indicators,\nbut given the trending nature of currencies, there are more efﬁcient ways to use the\nbands. Traditionally, Bollinger Bands consists of three lines—the 20-period moving\naverage and the two standard deviation bands above and below the moving average.\nIf the currency pair rises to the upper Bollinger Band, it is considered overbought\nbecause the move extended to an extreme level and should therefore be faded. The\nsame is true if it drops to the lower Bollinger Band. Unfortunately, currencies are\ntrending, and using the 20-period two standard deviation bands may not be the best\nway to trade. Take a look at Figure 9.1. In this daily chart of EURUSD, the arrows\nhighlight the points where the currency pair ‘‘hugs’’ the second standard deviation\nband. If you bought each time EURUSD touched the lower band or sold each time it\ntouched the upper band, there would be signiﬁcant losses before the currency pair\nﬁnally turned around.\nThe better technique would be to add another set of Bollinger Bands—the 20-\nperiod, one-standard deviation. This would put four bands on the chart if the basis\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS102\nFIGURE 9.1 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS103or the 20-period moving average is removed, and most charting packages will allow\nyou to do that. Figure 9.2 shows how the same EURUSD daily chart with look with\ntwo sets of Bollinger Bands. The outer lines are the two-standard-deviation Bollinger\nBands, and the two inner lines are the one-standard-deviation Bollinger Bands.\n■Using Double Bollinger Bands to Pick Tops\nand Bottoms\nHaving two sets of Bollinger Bands on your chart is a much more effective way\nto pick a top or bottom in currencies. The general rule of thumb is that we don’t\nbuy a bottom until the currency pair has traded above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. Along the same lines, we do not sell a top until the pair trades\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. While this technique may not\npick the perfect bottom, it can help avoid prematurely picking a top or bottom\nwhich can mean major losses in a trending environment. Here are the rules for the\nlong and short trades on a daily chart for picking tops and bottoms using the double\nBollinger Bands.\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be trading between the lower ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, BUY at close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 50 pips below ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be tra ding between the upper ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 30 pips above ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nLets take a look at the same EURUSD chart. Figure 9.3 shows the points at which\na trade would have been entered, and in most cases, it was a more effective way to\npick a top or bottom in the currency pair.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS104\nFIGURE 9.2 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS\nk\nk105\nk\nk\nFIGURE 9.3 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS106\nFIGURE 9.4 EURUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nNow let’s take a look at some examples in more detail. In Figure 9.4, we see that\non May 18, the EURUSD, which had been trading between the two upper bands,\nfell strongly to break out of the zone and close below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. We sell at the NY close (there’s usually a leeway of two hours). A\ntwo-lot trade is established at 1.1313 with a stop 30 pips above the ﬁrst standard\ndeviation Bollinger Band (1.1341) at 1.1371. The risk is 58 pips, which means that\nthe ﬁrst exit is 1.1313 minus 58 pips or 1.1255. The second proﬁt target is 1.1197,\nwhich is two times risk or 116 pips. The ﬁrst and second proﬁt targets are reached\non the very next day when the currency pair drops to a low of 1.1119, for a proﬁt\nof 58 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and another 116 pips on the second half. If\nthe stop was trailed using a moving average or percentage, a trader may have been\nable to capitalize on th e selloff that ensued.\nFigure 9.5 shows that on June 2, the EURUSD, which had been trading between\nthe two lower bands, rose strongly to break out of the zone and close ﬁrmly above\nthe ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. We buy at the NY close (there’s usually\na leeway of two hours). A two-lot trade is e stablished at 1.1151, with a stop 30 pips\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band (1.0970) at 1.0940. The risk is 211\npips, which means that the ﬁrst exit is 1.1151 plus 211 pips, or 1.1361. This proﬁt\ntarget is reached two days later, when the currency pair races to a high of 1.1380.\nAt the time, the stop is moved to 1.1151, and the following day the breakeven stop\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS107\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nC u r r e n c y 1 MR / R 3 MR / R 6 MR / R 1 Y RR / R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 :IC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC. 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C =Japanese Yen Call * SC =Sterling Call\n*E C =Euro Call * CC =Swiss Call\n*S P =Sterling Put\nFIGURE 9.5 EURUSD Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nis hit, and we end up banking only +211 on the ﬁrst half of the trade with no losses\nor gains on the second half.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Determine Trend versus Range\nIn addition to identifying levels to pick tops and bottoms, the double Bollinger Bands\ncan also be very helpful in determining the market environment. One of the most\ncommonly asked questions in forex is whether a currency pair is in trend or range.\nWhen the pair is trading be tween the two lower or upper Bollinger Bands, it is in\ntrend, and when it is trading between the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Bands,\nit is in range, as shown in Figure 9.6. When the currency pair is in trend mode,\nit is best to look for opportunities to join the trend. When it is in the range zone,\npicking tops and bottoms is preferred.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Join a New Trend\nAnother way to use the double Bollinger Bands is to join a new uptrend or downtrend\nusing a daily chart. Here are the trading rules:\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, buyat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS108\nFIGURE 9.6 GBPUSD Bollinger Band Trend Range Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS109\nFIGURE 9.7 USDJPY Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 9.8 GBPUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS1105. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\n5. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nHere are some examples:\nIn Figure 9.7, we see that USDJPY closed above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band on May 18. We check to see if the last two candles were below the\nband and the rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a long trade at 119.97. The\nstop is placed 65 pips below at 119.32. The target for the ﬁrst half of the position is\n50 pips, or 120.47, and the target for the second half is 195 pips, or 121.92. The\nﬁrst proﬁt target is reached 24 hours later (which is generally the case). When that\nhappens, the stop is raised to 119.97, which is the initial entry or breakeven price.\nThe trade is left on and the second proﬁt target of +195 pips is reached six trading\ndays after the trade was ﬁrst initiated.\nIn Figure 9.8, we see GBPUSD close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand on March 4, so we check to see if the last two candles were above the band and\nthe rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a short trade at 5pm when the currency\npair is trading at 1.5263. The stop is placed 65 pips above at 1.5328. The target for\nthe ﬁrst half of the position is 50 pips, or 1.5213, and the target for the second half\nis 195 pips, or 1.5068. The trade ﬂoats for 24 hours, then GBPUSD drops sharply,\nhitting our ﬁrst and second proﬁt target on the very same day.\nWe encourage you to lay the Bollinger Bands on your charts and look for more\nexamples of these strategies in action. There are many ways to use the double\nBollinger Bands for forex trading. Both of these strategies are for daily charts, but\ndifferent strategies and rules can be used for intraday trading using the bands.\n111CHAPTER 10\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Fading\nthe Double Zeros\nOne of the most widely overlooked areas of trading is market structure.\nDeveloping a keen understanding of market structure and its dynamics\ncan help day traders to gain an unbelievable advantage. Developing a feel and\nunderstanding for market dynamics is key to proﬁtably taking advantage of short-\nterm ﬂuctuations. In foreign exchange trading this is especially critical as the primary\ninﬂuence of intraday price action is order ﬂow. Given the fact that most individual\ntraders are not privy to sell-side bank order ﬂow, day traders looking to proﬁt from\nshort-term ﬂuctuations need to learn how to identify and anticipate price zones\nwhere large order ﬂows should be triggered. This technique is very efﬁcient for\nintraday traders as it allows them to get on the same side as the market maker.\nWhen trading intraday, it is impossible to look for bounces off every support or\nresistance level and expect to be proﬁtable. The key to successful intraday trading\nrequires more selectivity and only entering at those levels where a reaction is more\nlikely. Trading off psychologically important levels such as the double zeros or round\nnumbers is one good way of identifying such opportunities. Double zeros represent\nnumbers where the last two digits are zeros. Examples of double zeros would be\n118.00in USDJPY or 1.11 00in the EURUSD. After noticing how many times a\ncurrency pair would bounce off double zero support or resistance levels intraday\ndespite the underlying trend, we have observed that these bounces are usually much\nlarger and more relevant that rallies off other price levels. This type of reaction is\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS112perfect for intraday FX traders because it gives them the opportunity to make 30 to\n50 pips while risking only 15–20 pips.\nThis trading technique is not difﬁcult, but it requires individual traders to develop\na solid feel for dealing room and market participant psychology. The idea behind this\ndouble zero methodology is simple. Large banks with access to conditional order\nﬂow have a distinct advantage over other market participants. The bank’s order book\ngives them direct insight into potential reactions at different price levels. Dealers\nwill often use this strategic information to put on short-term positions in their own\naccounts.\nMarket participants as a whole tend to put conditional orders near or around\nthe same levels. While stop-loss orders are usually placed just beyond the round\nnumbers, traders will cluster their take proﬁt orders at the round number. The\nreason why this occurs is because traders are humans, and humans tend to think in\nround numbers. As a result, take proﬁt orders have a very high tendency of being\nplaced at the double zero level. Since the FX market is a 24-hour continuous market,\nspeculators also use stop and limit orders more frequently than in other markets.\nLarge banks with access to conditional order ﬂow, like stops and limits, actively seek\nto exploit this clustering of positions to basically gun stops. The fading the double zero\nstrategy attempts to put traders on the same side as market makers by positioning\ntraders for a quick contra-trend move at the double zero level.\nThis trade is most proﬁtable when there are other technical indicators that will\nconﬁrm the signiﬁcance of the double zero level. Here are some guidelines for fading\nthe double zeros or ‘‘round numbers.’’\n■Strategy Rules\nLong:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading below its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Enter a long position 10 to 15 pips above the ﬁgure.\n3. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips below the ﬁgure.\na. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to\nbreakeven.\nb. Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nShort:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading above its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Short the currency pair 10 to 15 pips below the ﬁgure.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS1133. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips above the round number.\n4. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount that you risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to breakeven.\nTrail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nMarket Conditions\nThis strategy works best when the move happens in quieter market conditions\nwithout the inﬂuence of major reports. It is more successful for currency pairs with\ntighter trading ranges, crosses, and commodity currencies. This strategy also works\nin the majors but under quieter market conditions since the stop loss is relatively\ntight.\nFurther Optimization\nRound numbers are important because they are signiﬁcant levels but if the price\ncoincides with a key technical level, a reversal becomes more likely. This means the\nstrategy has an even higher probability of success when other important support or\nresistance levels converge at the ﬁgure. This can be caused by moving averages, key\nFibonacci levels or Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some of the examples of this strategy in action. The ﬁrst\nexample that we will go over is a 15-minute chart of USDJPY shown in Figure 10.1.\nAccording to the rules of the strategy, we can see that on April 24, USDJPY was\ntrading above its 20-period moving. Prices continued to move higher with the\ncurrency pair drifting toward 120.00, our double zero level. In accordance with the\nrules, we place an entry order a few pips below the round number at 1110.85. Our\norder is triggered, and we put our stop 20 above the ﬁgure at 120.20. USDJPY\nclimbs to a high of 120.08 before turning lower. We close half of the position when\nit moves by the amount risked or 35 pips at 1110.50. Notice that USDJPY falls and\nthen rallies again before hitting our initial proﬁt target. When the ﬁrst proﬁt target\nis reached, the stop on the remaining half of the position is moved to breakeven or\nour initial entry price of 1110.85.\nWe then proceed to trail stop. The trailing stop can be done using a variety of\nmethods including a monetary or percentage basis. We choose to trail the stop by\ntwo-bar low for a really short-term trade and end up getting out of the other half of\nthe position at 1110.50 as well, earning us 35 pips on the ﬁrst and second half of the\npositions.\nThe next chart that we want to look at is GBPUSD. What’s interesting about\nFigure 10.2 is that there are a number of examples. In the ﬁrst example, labeled ‘‘1,’’\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS114\nFIGURE 10.1 USDJPY 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 10.2 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS115we can see that GBP/USD was trading above its 20-period moving average on a\n15-minute chart and headed for 1.55. According to our rules, we place an order to\nsell at 1.5485 (the high on this move was 1.5492) with a stop at 1.5520 for 35-pip\nrisk. GBPUSD moves in our favor, and our ﬁrst proﬁt target is hit at (1.5485 –.0035)\nat 1.5450. We then move our stop to breakeven, or our initial entry price of 1.5485,\nand proceed to trail it by the 20-day SMA +10 pips. If we manage our trade using\nthis type of trailing stop, the second half of the position would have been exited\nat 1.5350 for 35 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and 135 pips on the second.\nPart of the reason why this trade was so successful is because the 1.5500 is also\na signiﬁcant technical level. Example ‘‘2’’ is a long trail that reversed but not by\nenough to hit the proﬁt target. Example ‘‘3’’ is a successful long trade that hit the ﬁrst\nproﬁt target.\nMaking sure that the double zero level is a signiﬁcant level is a key element of\nﬁltering for good trades. The last example shown in Figure 10.3 is USDCAD on a\n15-minute chart. The great thing about this trade is that it is triple zero level rather\nthan just a double zero level. Triple zero levels hold even more signiﬁcance than a\ndouble zero level because of their less frequent occurrence. In Figure 10.3, we see\nthat USDCAD is also trading well below its 20-period moving average and heading\ntoward 1.2000. We look to go long 15 pips above the double zero level at 1.2015.\nFIGURE 10.3 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS116We place our stop 20 pips below the round number at 1.1980. The currency pair\nhits a low of 1.2011 before moving higher. We then sell half of our positions when\nthe currency pair rallies by the amount that we risked at 1.2050. The stop on the\nremaining half of the position is then moved to breakeven at 1.2015. We proceed\nto trail the stop once again by the two-bar low and end up exiting the second half\nof the position at 1.2055. As a result, we earned 35 pips on the ﬁrst position and\n40 pips on the second position.\n117CHAPTER 11\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Waiting\nfor the Deal\nThe lack of volume data in the FX market has forced day traders to develop\ndifferent strategies that rely less on the level of demand and more on the micro\nstructure of the market. One of the most common characteristics that day traders\ntry to exploit is the market’s 24-hour round-the-clock nature. Although the market\nis open for trading throughout the course of the day, the extent of market activity\nduring each trading session can vary signiﬁcantly. Traditionally, trading tends to be\nthe quietest during the Asian market hours as we indicated in Chapter 4. This means\nthat currencies such as the EURUSD and GBPUSD tend to trade within a very\ntight range during these hours. According to the Bank of International Settlement’s\nTriennial FX Survey published in September of 2014, the United Kingdom is the\nmost active trading center, capturing 41% of total volume. Adding in Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Switzerland, European trading as a whole accounts for 50% of\ntotal FX trading. The United States, on the other hand, is only second to the\nUnited Kingdom for the title of most active trading center, but that amounts to only\napproximately 19% of total turnover. This makes the London open exceptionally\nimportant because it gives the majority of traders in the market an opportunity\nto take advantage of events or announcements that may have occurred during\nlate U.S. trading or overnight Asian sessions. This becomes even more critical on\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL118days when the FOMC meets to discuss and announce monetary policy because the\nannouncement occurs at 2:15pm NY Time, after the London close.\nThe British pound trades most actively against the U.S. dollar during the European\nand London trading hours. There is also active trading during the U.S./European\noverlap, but outside those time frames, the pair tends to trade relatively lightly\nbecause the majority of GBPUSD trading is done through UK and European market\nmakers. This provides a great opportunity for day traders to capture the initial\ndirectional intraday real move that occurs within the ﬁrst few hours of London\ntrading. This strategy exploits the common perception that UK traders are notorious\nstop hunters. This means that the initial movement at the London open may not\nalways be the real one. Since UK and European dealers are the primary market\nmakers for the GBPUSD, they have tremendous insight into the extent of actual\nsupply and demand for the pair. The ‘‘waiting for the real deal’’ trading strategy\nﬁrst sets up when interbank dealing desks survey their books at the onset of trading\nand use their client data to trigger close stops on both sides of the markets to gain\nthe pip differential. Once these stops are taken out and the books are cleared, the\nreal directional move in the GBPUSD will begin to occur, at which point we look\nfor the rules of this strategy to be met before entering into a long or short position.\nThis strategy works best following the U.S. open or after a major economic release.\nWith this strategy, you are looking for th e noise in the markets to settle before\ntrading the real trend of the day.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Early European trading in GBPUSD begins around 1am NY Time, and we look\nfor the pair to make new range low of at least 25 pips above the opening price\n(the range is deﬁned as t he price action between the Frankfurt and London\npower hour of 6 GMT to 7 GMT NY Time).\n2. Look for the pair to reverse and penetrate the high.\n3. Place an entry order to buy 10 pips above the high of the range.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range high, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nShorts:\n1. GBPUSD opens in Europe and trades more than 25 pips above the high\nestablished during the Frankfurt to London power hour.\n2. Wait for the pair to reverse and penetrate the low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL1193. When that occurs, place an entry order to sell 10 pips below the low of the\nrange.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range low, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some examples of this strategy in action. Figure 11.1 is\na textbook example of the ‘‘waiting for th e real deal’’ strategy. Between 6 and 7\nGMT, the range high and low for GBPUSD are 1.5359 and 1.5234, respectively. At\nthe start of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upwards, taking\nout the range high of 1.5359. At the time, we place an order to sell GBPUSD 10\npips below the range low at 1.5324. The entry is triggered about an hour and a half\nlater. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35 pips total) at\n1.5359. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5274, or 50 pips below\nthe entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven\nor 1.5324. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at 1.5219\nshortly after the NY open.\nFIGURE 11.1 GBPUSD 5-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL120\nFIGURE 11.2 GBPUSD 10-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 11.3 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL121The next example is shown in Figure 11.2. In this example, the range high and\nlow established between 6 and 7 GMT are 1 .5433 and 1.5399, resp ectively. At the\nstart of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upward, taking out\nthe range high of 1.5433 and racing all the way to 1.5492. At the time, we place an\norder to sell GBPUSD 10 pips below the range low at 1.5389. The entry is triggered\naround the NY open. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35\npips total) at 1.5424. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5339, or 50\npips below the entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to\nbreakeven or 1.5389. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at\n1.5284 after the London open on the following trading day.\nThe third example is shown in Figure 11.3. In this example, the range during the\nFrankfurt London power hour is 1.5187 and 1.5139. At the start of the London\ntrading session, GBPUSD drips lower, breaking below the range low and trading\ndown to 1.5105. When the range low is broken, we place an order to buy GBPUSD\n10 pips below the range high at 1.5197. The entry is triggered around the NY open.\nThe protective stop is placed 25 pips below the range high (35 pips total) at 1.5172.\nA take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5247, or 50 pips below the entry\nprice. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or 1.5197.\nThe second exit is not shown in the chart in Figure 11.3, but the breakeven stop is\ntriggered."

        "101CHAPTER 9\nTechnical Strategy:\nTrading with\nDouble Bollinger\nBands\nOne of the most useful technical indicators in my experience is Bollinger Bands.\nTraditionally, Bollinger Bands are used as overbought and oversold indicators,\nbut given the trending nature of currencies, there are more efﬁcient ways to use the\nbands. Traditionally, Bollinger Bands consists of three lines—the 20-period moving\naverage and the two standard deviation bands above and below the moving average.\nIf the currency pair rises to the upper Bollinger Band, it is considered overbought\nbecause the move extended to an extreme level and should therefore be faded. The\nsame is true if it drops to the lower Bollinger Band. Unfortunately, currencies are\ntrending, and using the 20-period two standard deviation bands may not be the best\nway to trade. Take a look at Figure 9.1. In this daily chart of EURUSD, the arrows\nhighlight the points where the currency pair ‘‘hugs’’ the second standard deviation\nband. If you bought each time EURUSD touched the lower band or sold each time it\ntouched the upper band, there would be signiﬁcant losses before the currency pair\nﬁnally turned around.\nThe better technique would be to add another set of Bollinger Bands—the 20-\nperiod, one-standard deviation. This would put four bands on the chart if the basis\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS102\nFIGURE 9.1 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS103or the 20-period moving average is removed, and most charting packages will allow\nyou to do that. Figure 9.2 shows how the same EURUSD daily chart with look with\ntwo sets of Bollinger Bands. The outer lines are the two-standard-deviation Bollinger\nBands, and the two inner lines are the one-standard-deviation Bollinger Bands.\n■Using Double Bollinger Bands to Pick Tops\nand Bottoms\nHaving two sets of Bollinger Bands on your chart is a much more effective way\nto pick a top or bottom in currencies. The general rule of thumb is that we don’t\nbuy a bottom until the currency pair has traded above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. Along the same lines, we do not sell a top until the pair trades\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. While this technique may not\npick the perfect bottom, it can help avoid prematurely picking a top or bottom\nwhich can mean major losses in a trending environment. Here are the rules for the\nlong and short trades on a daily chart for picking tops and bottoms using the double\nBollinger Bands.\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be trading between the lower ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, BUY at close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 50 pips below ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be tra ding between the upper ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 30 pips above ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6.

Figure 9.3 shows the points at which\na trade would have been entered, and in most cases, it was a more effective way to\npick a top or bottom in the currency pair.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS104\nFIGURE 9.2 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS\nk\nk105\nk\nk\nFIGURE 9.3 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS106\nFIGURE 9.4 EURUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nNow let’s take a look at some examples in more detail. In Figure 9.4, we see that\non May 18, the EURUSD, which had been trading between the two upper bands,\nfell strongly to break out of the zone and close below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. We sell at the NY close (there’s usually a leeway of two hours). A\ntwo-lot trade is established at 1.1313 with a stop 30 pips above the ﬁrst standard\ndeviation Bollinger Band (1.1341) at 1.1371. The risk is 58 pips, which means that\nthe ﬁrst exit is 1.1313 minus 58 pips or 1.1255. The second proﬁt target is 1.1197,\nwhich is two times risk or 116 pips. The ﬁrst and second proﬁt targets are reached\non the very next day when the currency pair drops to a low of 1.1119, for a proﬁt\nof 58 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and another 116 pips on the second half. If\nthe stop was trailed using a moving average or percentage, a trader may have been\nable to capitalize on th e selloff that ensued.\nFigure 9.5 shows that on June 2, the EURUSD, which had been trading between\nthe two lower bands, rose strongly to break out of the zone and close ﬁrmly above\nthe ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. We buy at the NY close (there’s usually\na leeway of two hours). A two-lot trade is e stablished at 1.1151, with a stop 30 pips\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band (1.0970) at 1.0940. The risk is 211\npips, which means that the ﬁrst exit is 1.1151 plus 211 pips, or 1.1361. This proﬁt\ntarget is reached two days later, when the currency pair races to a high of 1.1380.\nAt the time, the stop is moved to 1.1151, and the following day the breakeven stop\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS107\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nC u r r e n c y 1 MR / R 3 MR / R 6 MR / R 1 Y RR / R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 :IC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC. 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C =Japanese Yen Call * SC =Sterling Call\n*E C =Euro Call * CC =Swiss Call\n*S P =Sterling Put\nFIGURE 9.5 EURUSD Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nis hit, and we end up banking only +211 on the ﬁrst half of the trade with no losses\nor gains on the second half.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Determine Trend versus Range\nIn addition to identifying levels to pick tops and bottoms, the double Bollinger Bands\ncan also be very helpful in determining the market environment. One of the most\ncommonly asked questions in forex is whether a currency pair is in trend or range.\nWhen the pair is trading be tween the two lower or upper Bollinger Bands, it is in\ntrend, and when it is trading between the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Bands,\nit is in range, as shown in Figure 9.6. When the currency pair is in trend mode,\nit is best to look for opportunities to join the trend. When it is in the range zone,\npicking tops and bottoms is preferred.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Join a New Trend\nAnother way to use the double Bollinger Bands is to join a new uptrend or downtrend\nusing a daily chart. Here are the trading rules:\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, buyat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS108\nFIGURE 9.6 GBPUSD Bollinger Band Trend Range Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS109\nFIGURE 9.7 USDJPY Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 9.8 GBPUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS1105. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\n5. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nHere are some examples:\nIn Figure 9.7, we see that USDJPY closed above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band on May 18. We check to see if the last two candles were below the\nband and the rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a long trade at 119.97. The\nstop is placed 65 pips below at 119.32. The target for the ﬁrst half of the position is\n50 pips, or 120.47, and the target for the second half is 195 pips, or 121.92. The\nﬁrst proﬁt target is reached 24 hours later (which is generally the case). When that\nhappens, the stop is raised to 119.97, which is the initial entry or breakeven price.\nThe trade is left on and the second proﬁt target of +195 pips is reached six trading\ndays after the trade was ﬁrst initiated.\nIn Figure 9.8, we see GBPUSD close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand on March 4, so we check to see if the last two candles were above the band and\nthe rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a short trade at 5pm when the currency\npair is trading at 1.5263. The stop is placed 65 pips above at 1.5328. The target for\nthe ﬁrst half of the position is 50 pips, or 1.5213, and the target for the second half\nis 195 pips, or 1.5068. The trade ﬂoats for 24 hours, then GBPUSD drops sharply,\nhitting our ﬁrst and second proﬁt target on the very same day.\nWe encourage you to lay the Bollinger Bands on your charts and look for more\nexamples of these strategies in action. There are many ways to use the double\nBollinger Bands for forex trading. Both of these strategies are for daily charts, but\ndifferent strategies and rules can be used for intraday trading using the bands.\n111CHAPTER 10\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Fading\nthe Double Zeros\nOne of the most widely overlooked areas of trading is market structure.\nDeveloping a keen understanding of market structure and its dynamics\ncan help day traders to gain an unbelievable advantage. Developing a feel and\nunderstanding for market dynamics is key to proﬁtably taking advantage of short-\nterm ﬂuctuations. In foreign exchange trading this is especially critical as the primary\ninﬂuence of intraday price action is order ﬂow. Given the fact that most individual\ntraders are not privy to sell-side bank order ﬂow, day traders looking to proﬁt from\nshort-term ﬂuctuations need to learn how to identify and anticipate price zones\nwhere large order ﬂows should be triggered. This technique is very efﬁcient for\nintraday traders as it allows them to get on the same side as the market maker.\nWhen trading intraday, it is impossible to look for bounces off every support or\nresistance level and expect to be proﬁtable. The key to successful intraday trading\nrequires more selectivity and only entering at those levels where a reaction is more\nlikely. Trading off psychologically important levels such as the double zeros or round\nnumbers is one good way of identifying such opportunities. Double zeros represent\nnumbers where the last two digits are zeros. Examples of double zeros would be\n118.00in USDJPY or 1.11 00in the EURUSD. After noticing how many times a\ncurrency pair would bounce off double zero support or resistance levels intraday\ndespite the underlying trend, we have observed that these bounces are usually much\nlarger and more relevant that rallies off other price levels. This type of reaction is\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS112perfect for intraday FX traders because it gives them the opportunity to make 30 to\n50 pips while risking only 15–20 pips.\nThis trading technique is not difﬁcult, but it requires individual traders to develop\na solid feel for dealing room and market participant psychology. The idea behind this\ndouble zero methodology is simple. Large banks with access to conditional order\nﬂow have a distinct advantage over other market participants. The bank’s order book\ngives them direct insight into potential reactions at different price levels. Dealers\nwill often use this strategic information to put on short-term positions in their own\naccounts.\nMarket participants as a whole tend to put conditional orders near or around\nthe same levels. While stop-loss orders are usually placed just beyond the round\nnumbers, traders will cluster their take proﬁt orders at the round number. The\nreason why this occurs is because traders are humans, and humans tend to think in\nround numbers. As a result, take proﬁt orders have a very high tendency of being\nplaced at the double zero level. Since the FX market is a 24-hour continuous market,\nspeculators also use stop and limit orders more frequently than in other markets.\nLarge banks with access to conditional order ﬂow, like stops and limits, actively seek\nto exploit this clustering of positions to basically gun stops. The fading the double zero\nstrategy attempts to put traders on the same side as market makers by positioning\ntraders for a quick contra-trend move at the double zero level.\nThis trade is most proﬁtable when there are other technical indicators that will\nconﬁrm the signiﬁcance of the double zero level. Here are some guidelines for fading\nthe double zeros or ‘‘round numbers.’’\n■Strategy Rules\nLong:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading below its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Enter a long position 10 to 15 pips above the ﬁgure.\n3. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips below the ﬁgure.\na. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to\nbreakeven.\nb. Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nShort:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading above its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Short the currency pair 10 to 15 pips below the ﬁgure.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS1133. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips above the round number.\n4. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount that you risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to breakeven.\nTrail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nMarket Conditions\nThis strategy works best when the move happens in quieter market conditions\nwithout the inﬂuence of major reports. It is more successful for currency pairs with\ntighter trading ranges, crosses, and commodity currencies. This strategy also works\nin the majors but under quieter market conditions since the stop loss is relatively\ntight.\nFurther Optimization\nRound numbers are important because they are signiﬁcant levels but if the price\ncoincides with a key technical level, a reversal becomes more likely. This means the\nstrategy has an even higher probability of success when other important support or\nresistance levels converge at the ﬁgure. This can be caused by moving averages, key\nFibonacci levels or Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some of the examples of this strategy in action. The ﬁrst\nexample that we will go over is a 15-minute chart of USDJPY shown in Figure 10.1.\nAccording to the rules of the strategy, we can see that on April 24, USDJPY was\ntrading above its 20-period moving. Prices continued to move higher with the\ncurrency pair drifting toward 120.00, our double zero level. In accordance with the\nrules, we place an entry order a few pips below the round number at 1110.85. Our\norder is triggered, and we put our stop 20 above the ﬁgure at 120.20. USDJPY\nclimbs to a high of 120.08 before turning lower. We close half of the position when\nit moves by the amount risked or 35 pips at 1110.50. Notice that USDJPY falls and\nthen rallies again before hitting our initial proﬁt target. When the ﬁrst proﬁt target\nis reached, the stop on the remaining half of the position is moved to breakeven or\nour initial entry price of 1110.85.\nWe then proceed to trail stop. The trailing stop can be done using a variety of\nmethods including a monetary or percentage basis. We choose to trail the stop by\ntwo-bar low for a really short-term trade and end up getting out of the other half of\nthe position at 1110.50 as well, earning us 35 pips on the ﬁrst and second half of the\npositions.\nThe next chart that we want to look at is GBPUSD. What’s interesting about\nFigure 10.2 is that there are a number of examples. In the ﬁrst example, labeled ‘‘1,’’\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS114\nFIGURE 10.1 USDJPY 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 10.2 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS115we can see that GBP/USD was trading above its 20-period moving average on a\n15-minute chart and headed for 1.55. According to our rules, we place an order to\nsell at 1.5485 (the high on this move was 1.5492) with a stop at 1.5520 for 35-pip\nrisk. GBPUSD moves in our favor, and our ﬁrst proﬁt target is hit at (1.5485 –.0035)\nat 1.5450. We then move our stop to breakeven, or our initial entry price of 1.5485,\nand proceed to trail it by the 20-day SMA +10 pips. If we manage our trade using\nthis type of trailing stop, the second half of the position would have been exited\nat 1.5350 for 35 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and 135 pips on the second.\nPart of the reason why this trade was so successful is because the 1.5500 is also\na signiﬁcant technical level. Example ‘‘2’’ is a long trail that reversed but not by\nenough to hit the proﬁt target. Example ‘‘3’’ is a successful long trade that hit the ﬁrst\nproﬁt target.\nMaking sure that the double zero level is a signiﬁcant level is a key element of\nﬁltering for good trades. The last example shown in Figure 10.3 is USDCAD on a\n15-minute chart. The great thing about this trade is that it is triple zero level rather\nthan just a double zero level. Triple zero levels hold even more signiﬁcance than a\ndouble zero level because of their less frequent occurrence. In Figure 10.3, we see\nthat USDCAD is also trading well below its 20-period moving average and heading\ntoward 1.2000. We look to go long 15 pips above the double zero level at 1.2015.\nFIGURE 10.3 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS116We place our stop 20 pips below the round number at 1.1980. The currency pair\nhits a low of 1.2011 before moving higher. We then sell half of our positions when\nthe currency pair rallies by the amount that we risked at 1.2050. The stop on the\nremaining half of the position is then moved to breakeven at 1.2015. We proceed\nto trail the stop once again by the two-bar low and end up exiting the second half\nof the position at 1.2055. As a result, we earned 35 pips on the ﬁrst position and\n40 pips on the second position.\n117CHAPTER 11\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Waiting\nfor the Deal\nThe lack of volume data in the FX market has forced day traders to develop\ndifferent strategies that rely less on the level of demand and more on the micro\nstructure of the market. One of the most common characteristics that day traders\ntry to exploit is the market’s 24-hour round-the-clock nature. Although the market\nis open for trading throughout the course of the day, the extent of market activity\nduring each trading session can vary signiﬁcantly. Traditionally, trading tends to be\nthe quietest during the Asian market hours as we indicated in Chapter 4. This means\nthat currencies such as the EURUSD and GBPUSD tend to trade within a very\ntight range during these hours. According to the Bank of International Settlement’s\nTriennial FX Survey published in September of 2014, the United Kingdom is the\nmost active trading center, capturing 41% of total volume. Adding in Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Switzerland, European trading as a whole accounts for 50% of\ntotal FX trading. The United States, on the other hand, is only second to the\nUnited Kingdom for the title of most active trading center, but that amounts to only\napproximately 19% of total turnover. This makes the London open exceptionally\nimportant because it gives the majority of traders in the market an opportunity\nto take advantage of events or announcements that may have occurred during\nlate U.S. trading or overnight Asian sessions. This becomes even more critical on\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL118days when the FOMC meets to discuss and announce monetary policy because the\nannouncement occurs at 2:15pm NY Time, after the London close.\nThe British pound trades most actively against the U.S. dollar during the European\nand London trading hours. There is also active trading during the U.S./European\noverlap, but outside those time frames, the pair tends to trade relatively lightly\nbecause the majority of GBPUSD trading is done through UK and European market\nmakers. This provides a great opportunity for day traders to capture the initial\ndirectional intraday real move that occurs within the ﬁrst few hours of London\ntrading. This strategy exploits the common perception that UK traders are notorious\nstop hunters. This means that the initial movement at the London open may not\nalways be the real one. Since UK and European dealers are the primary market\nmakers for the GBPUSD, they have tremendous insight into the extent of actual\nsupply and demand for the pair. The ‘‘waiting for the real deal’’ trading strategy\nﬁrst sets up when interbank dealing desks survey their books at the onset of trading\nand use their client data to trigger close stops on both sides of the markets to gain\nthe pip differential. Once these stops are taken out and the books are cleared, the\nreal directional move in the GBPUSD will begin to occur, at which point we look\nfor the rules of this strategy to be met before entering into a long or short position.\nThis strategy works best following the U.S. open or after a major economic release.\nWith this strategy, you are looking for th e noise in the markets to settle before\ntrading the real trend of the day.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Early European trading in GBPUSD begins around 1am NY Time, and we look\nfor the pair to make new range low of at least 25 pips above the opening price\n(the range is deﬁned as t he price action between the Frankfurt and London\npower hour of 6 GMT to 7 GMT NY Time).\n2. Look for the pair to reverse and penetrate the high.\n3. Place an entry order to buy 10 pips above the high of the range.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range high, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nShorts:\n1. GBPUSD opens in Europe and trades more than 25 pips above the high\nestablished during the Frankfurt to London power hour.\n2. Wait for the pair to reverse and penetrate the low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL1193. When that occurs, place an entry order to sell 10 pips below the low of the\nrange.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range low, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some examples of this strategy in action. Figure 11.1 is\na textbook example of the ‘‘waiting for th e real deal’’ strategy. Between 6 and 7\nGMT, the range high and low for GBPUSD are 1.5359 and 1.5234, respectively. At\nthe start of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upwards, taking\nout the range high of 1.5359. At the time, we place an order to sell GBPUSD 10\npips below the range low at 1.5324. The entry is triggered about an hour and a half\nlater. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35 pips total) at\n1.5359. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5274, or 50 pips below\nthe entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven\nor 1.5324. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at 1.5219\nshortly after the NY open.\nFIGURE 11.1 GBPUSD 5-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL120\nFIGURE 11.2 GBPUSD 10-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 11.3 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL121The next example is shown in Figure 11.2. In this example, the range high and\nlow established between 6 and 7 GMT are 1 .5433 and 1.5399, resp ectively. At the\nstart of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upward, taking out\nthe range high of 1.5433 and racing all the way to 1.5492. At the time, we place an\norder to sell GBPUSD 10 pips below the range low at 1.5389. The entry is triggered\naround the NY open. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35\npips total) at 1.5424. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5339, or 50\npips below the entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to\nbreakeven or 1.5389. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at\n1.5284 after the London open on the following trading day.\nThe third example is shown in Figure 11.3. In this example, the range during the\nFrankfurt London power hour is 1.5187 and 1.5139. At the start of the London\ntrading session, GBPUSD drips lower, breaking below the range low and trading\ndown to 1.5105. When the range low is broken, we place an order to buy GBPUSD\n10 pips below the range high at 1.5197. The entry is triggered around the NY open.\nThe protective stop is placed 25 pips below the range high (35 pips total) at 1.5172.\nA take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5247, or 50 pips below the entry\nprice. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or 1.5197.\nThe second exit is not shown in the chart in Figure 11.3, but the breakeven stop is\ntriggered.",
        "101CHAPTER 9\nTechnical Strategy:\nTrading with\nDouble Bollinger\nBands\nOne of the most useful technical indicators in my experience is Bollinger Bands.\nTraditionally, Bollinger Bands are used as overbought and oversold indicators,\nbut given the trending nature of currencies, there are more efﬁcient ways to use the\nbands. Traditionally, Bollinger Bands consists of three lines—the 20-period moving\naverage and the two standard deviation bands above and below the moving average.\nIf the currency pair rises to the upper Bollinger Band, it is considered overbought\nbecause the move extended to an extreme level and should therefore be faded. The\nsame is true if it drops to the lower Bollinger Band. Unfortunately, currencies are\ntrending, and using the 20-period two standard deviation bands may not be the best\nway to trade. Take a look at Figure 9.1. In this daily chart of EURUSD, the arrows\nhighlight the points where the currency pair ‘‘hugs’’ the second standard deviation\nband. If you bought each time EURUSD touched the lower band or sold each time it\ntouched the upper band, there would be signiﬁcant losses before the currency pair\nﬁnally turned around.\nThe better technique would be to add another set of Bollinger Bands—the 20-\nperiod, one-standard deviation. This would put four bands on the chart if the basis\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS102\nFIGURE 9.1 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS103or the 20-period moving average is removed, and most charting packages will allow\nyou to do that. Figure 9.2 shows how the same EURUSD daily chart with look with\ntwo sets of Bollinger Bands. The outer lines are the two-standard-deviation Bollinger\nBands, and the two inner lines are the one-standard-deviation Bollinger Bands.\n■Using Double Bollinger Bands to Pick Tops\nand Bottoms\nHaving two sets of Bollinger Bands on your chart is a much more effective way\nto pick a top or bottom in currencies. The general rule of thumb is that we don’t\nbuy a bottom until the currency pair has traded above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. Along the same lines, we do not sell a top until the pair trades\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. While this technique may not\npick the perfect bottom, it can help avoid prematurely picking a top or bottom\nwhich can mean major losses in a trending environment. Here are the rules for the\nlong and short trades on a daily chart for picking tops and bottoms using the double\nBollinger Bands.\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be trading between the lower ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, BUY at close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 50 pips below ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be tra ding between the upper ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 30 pips above ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nLets take a look at the same EURUSD chart. Figure 9.3 shows the points at which\na trade would have been entered, and in most cases, it was a more effective way to\npick a top or bottom in the currency pair.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS104\nFIGURE 9.2 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS\nk\nk105\nk\nk\nFIGURE 9.3 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS106\nFIGURE 9.4 EURUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nNow let’s take a look at some examples in more detail. In Figure 9.4, we see that\non May 18, the EURUSD, which had been trading between the two upper bands,\nfell strongly to break out of the zone and close below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. We sell at the NY close (there’s usually a leeway of two hours). A\ntwo-lot trade is established at 1.1313 with a stop 30 pips above the ﬁrst standard\ndeviation Bollinger Band (1.1341) at 1.1371. The risk is 58 pips, which means that\nthe ﬁrst exit is 1.1313 minus 58 pips or 1.1255. The second proﬁt target is 1.1197,\nwhich is two times risk or 116 pips. The ﬁrst and second proﬁt targets are reached\non the very next day when the currency pair drops to a low of 1.1119, for a proﬁt\nof 58 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and another 116 pips on the second half. If\nthe stop was trailed using a moving average or percentage, a trader may have been\nable to capitalize on th e selloff that ensued.\nFigure 9.5 shows that on June 2, the EURUSD, which had been trading between\nthe two lower bands, rose strongly to break out of the zone and close ﬁrmly above\nthe ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. We buy at the NY close (there’s usually\na leeway of two hours). A two-lot trade is e stablished at 1.1151, with a stop 30 pips\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band (1.0970) at 1.0940. The risk is 211\npips, which means that the ﬁrst exit is 1.1151 plus 211 pips, or 1.1361. This proﬁt\ntarget is reached two days later, when the currency pair races to a high of 1.1380.\nAt the time, the stop is moved to 1.1151, and the following day the breakeven stop\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS107\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nC u r r e n c y 1 MR / R 3 MR / R 6 MR / R 1 Y RR / R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 :IC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC. 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C =Japanese Yen Call * SC =Sterling Call\n*E C =Euro Call * CC =Swiss Call\n*S P =Sterling Put\nFIGURE 9.5 EURUSD Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nis hit, and we end up banking only +211 on the ﬁrst half of the trade with no losses\nor gains on the second half.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Determine Trend versus Range\nIn addition to identifying levels to pick tops and bottoms, the double Bollinger Bands\ncan also be very helpful in determining the market environment. One of the most\ncommonly asked questions in forex is whether a currency pair is in trend or range.\nWhen the pair is trading be tween the two lower or upper Bollinger Bands, it is in\ntrend, and when it is trading between the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Bands,\nit is in range, as shown in Figure 9.6. When the currency pair is in trend mode,\nit is best to look for opportunities to join the trend. When it is in the range zone,\npicking tops and bottoms is preferred.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Join a New Trend\nAnother way to use the double Bollinger Bands is to join a new uptrend or downtrend\nusing a daily chart. Here are the trading rules:\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, buyat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS108\nFIGURE 9.6 GBPUSD Bollinger Band Trend Range Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS109\nFIGURE 9.7 USDJPY Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 9.8 GBPUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS1105. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\n5. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nHere are some examples:\nIn Figure 9.7, we see that USDJPY closed above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band on May 18. We check to see if the last two candles were below the\nband and the rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a long trade at 119.97. The\nstop is placed 65 pips below at 119.32. The target for the ﬁrst half of the position is\n50 pips, or 120.47, and the target for the second half is 195 pips, or 121.92. The\nﬁrst proﬁt target is reached 24 hours later (which is generally the case). When that\nhappens, the stop is raised to 119.97, which is the initial entry or breakeven price.\nThe trade is left on and the second proﬁt target of +195 pips is reached six trading\ndays after the trade was ﬁrst initiated.\nIn Figure 9.8, we see GBPUSD close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand on March 4, so we check to see if the last two candles were above the band and\nthe rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a short trade at 5pm when the currency\npair is trading at 1.5263. The stop is placed 65 pips above at 1.5328. The target for\nthe ﬁrst half of the position is 50 pips, or 1.5213, and the target for the second half\nis 195 pips, or 1.5068. The trade ﬂoats for 24 hours, then GBPUSD drops sharply,\nhitting our ﬁrst and second proﬁt target on the very same day.\nWe encourage you to lay the Bollinger Bands on your charts and look for more\nexamples of these strategies in action. There are many ways to use the double\nBollinger Bands for forex trading. Both of these strategies are for daily charts, but\ndifferent strategies and rules can be used for intraday trading using the bands.\n111CHAPTER 10\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Fading\nthe Double Zeros\nOne of the most widely overlooked areas of trading is market structure.\nDeveloping a keen understanding of market structure and its dynamics\ncan help day traders to gain an unbelievable advantage. Developing a feel and\nunderstanding for market dynamics is key to proﬁtably taking advantage of short-\nterm ﬂuctuations. In foreign exchange trading this is especially critical as the primary\ninﬂuence of intraday price action is order ﬂow. Given the fact that most individual\ntraders are not privy to sell-side bank order ﬂow, day traders looking to proﬁt from\nshort-term ﬂuctuations need to learn how to identify and anticipate price zones\nwhere large order ﬂows should be triggered. This technique is very efﬁcient for\nintraday traders as it allows them to get on the same side as the market maker.\nWhen trading intraday, it is impossible to look for bounces off every support or\nresistance level and expect to be proﬁtable. The key to successful intraday trading\nrequires more selectivity and only entering at those levels where a reaction is more\nlikely. Trading off psychologically important levels such as the double zeros or round\nnumbers is one good way of identifying such opportunities. Double zeros represent\nnumbers where the last two digits are zeros. Examples of double zeros would be\n118.00in USDJPY or 1.11 00in the EURUSD. After noticing how many times a\ncurrency pair would bounce off double zero support or resistance levels intraday\ndespite the underlying trend, we have observed that these bounces are usually much\nlarger and more relevant that rallies off other price levels. This type of reaction is\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS112perfect for intraday FX traders because it gives them the opportunity to make 30 to\n50 pips while risking only 15–20 pips.\nThis trading technique is not difﬁcult, but it requires individual traders to develop\na solid feel for dealing room and market participant psychology. The idea behind this\ndouble zero methodology is simple. Large banks with access to conditional order\nﬂow have a distinct advantage over other market participants. The bank’s order book\ngives them direct insight into potential reactions at different price levels. Dealers\nwill often use this strategic information to put on short-term positions in their own\naccounts.\nMarket participants as a whole tend to put conditional orders near or around\nthe same levels. While stop-loss orders are usually placed just beyond the round\nnumbers, traders will cluster their take proﬁt orders at the round number. The\nreason why this occurs is because traders are humans, and humans tend to think in\nround numbers. As a result, take proﬁt orders have a very high tendency of being\nplaced at the double zero level. Since the FX market is a 24-hour continuous market,\nspeculators also use stop and limit orders more frequently than in other markets.\nLarge banks with access to conditional order ﬂow, like stops and limits, actively seek\nto exploit this clustering of positions to basically gun stops. The fading the double zero\nstrategy attempts to put traders on the same side as market makers by positioning\ntraders for a quick contra-trend move at the double zero level.\nThis trade is most proﬁtable when there are other technical indicators that will\nconﬁrm the signiﬁcance of the double zero level. Here are some guidelines for fading\nthe double zeros or ‘‘round numbers.’’\n■Strategy Rules\nLong:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading below its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Enter a long position 10 to 15 pips above the ﬁgure.\n3. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips below the ﬁgure.\na. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to\nbreakeven.\nb. Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nShort:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading above its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Short the currency pair 10 to 15 pips below the ﬁgure.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS1133. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips above the round number.\n4. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount that you risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to breakeven.\nTrail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nMarket Conditions\nThis strategy works best when the move happens in quieter market conditions\nwithout the inﬂuence of major reports. It is more successful for currency pairs with\ntighter trading ranges, crosses, and commodity currencies. This strategy also works\nin the majors but under quieter market conditions since the stop loss is relatively\ntight.\nFurther Optimization\nRound numbers are important because they are signiﬁcant levels but if the price\ncoincides with a key technical level, a reversal becomes more likely. This means the\nstrategy has an even higher probability of success when other important support or\nresistance levels converge at the ﬁgure. This can be caused by moving averages, key\nFibonacci levels or Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some of the examples of this strategy in action. The ﬁrst\nexample that we will go over is a 15-minute chart of USDJPY shown in Figure 10.1.\nAccording to the rules of the strategy, we can see that on April 24, USDJPY was\ntrading above its 20-period moving. Prices continued to move higher with the\ncurrency pair drifting toward 120.00, our double zero level. In accordance with the\nrules, we place an entry order a few pips below the round number at 1110.85. Our\norder is triggered, and we put our stop 20 above the ﬁgure at 120.20. USDJPY\nclimbs to a high of 120.08 before turning lower. We close half of the position when\nit moves by the amount risked or 35 pips at 1110.50. Notice that USDJPY falls and\nthen rallies again before hitting our initial proﬁt target. When the ﬁrst proﬁt target\nis reached, the stop on the remaining half of the position is moved to breakeven or\nour initial entry price of 1110.85.\nWe then proceed to trail stop. The trailing stop can be done using a variety of\nmethods including a monetary or percentage basis. We choose to trail the stop by\ntwo-bar low for a really short-term trade and end up getting out of the other half of\nthe position at 1110.50 as well, earning us 35 pips on the ﬁrst and second half of the\npositions.\nThe next chart that we want to look at is GBPUSD. What’s interesting about\nFigure 10.2 is that there are a number of examples. In the ﬁrst example, labeled ‘‘1,’’\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS114\nFIGURE 10.1 USDJPY 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 10.2 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS115we can see that GBP/USD was trading above its 20-period moving average on a\n15-minute chart and headed for 1.55. According to our rules, we place an order to\nsell at 1.5485 (the high on this move was 1.5492) with a stop at 1.5520 for 35-pip\nrisk. GBPUSD moves in our favor, and our ﬁrst proﬁt target is hit at (1.5485 –.0035)\nat 1.5450. We then move our stop to breakeven, or our initial entry price of 1.5485,\nand proceed to trail it by the 20-day SMA +10 pips. If we manage our trade using\nthis type of trailing stop, the second half of the position would have been exited\nat 1.5350 for 35 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and 135 pips on the second.\nPart of the reason why this trade was so successful is because the 1.5500 is also\na signiﬁcant technical level. Example ‘‘2’’ is a long trail that reversed but not by\nenough to hit the proﬁt target. Example ‘‘3’’ is a successful long trade that hit the ﬁrst\nproﬁt target.\nMaking sure that the double zero level is a signiﬁcant level is a key element of\nﬁltering for good trades. The last example shown in Figure 10.3 is USDCAD on a\n15-minute chart. The great thing about this trade is that it is triple zero level rather\nthan just a double zero level. Triple zero levels hold even more signiﬁcance than a\ndouble zero level because of their less frequent occurrence. In Figure 10.3, we see\nthat USDCAD is also trading well below its 20-period moving average and heading\ntoward 1.2000. We look to go long 15 pips above the double zero level at 1.2015.\nFIGURE 10.3 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS116We place our stop 20 pips below the round number at 1.1980. The currency pair\nhits a low of 1.2011 before moving higher. We then sell half of our positions when\nthe currency pair rallies by the amount that we risked at 1.2050. The stop on the\nremaining half of the position is then moved to breakeven at 1.2015. We proceed\nto trail the stop once again by the two-bar low and end up exiting the second half\nof the position at 1.2055. As a result, we earned 35 pips on the ﬁrst position and\n40 pips on the second position.\n117CHAPTER 11\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Waiting\nfor the Deal\nThe lack of volume data in the FX market has forced day traders to develop\ndifferent strategies that rely less on the level of demand and more on the micro\nstructure of the market. One of the most common characteristics that day traders\ntry to exploit is the market’s 24-hour round-the-clock nature. Although the market\nis open for trading throughout the course of the day, the extent of market activity\nduring each trading session can vary signiﬁcantly. Traditionally, trading tends to be\nthe quietest during the Asian market hours as we indicated in Chapter 4. This means\nthat currencies such as the EURUSD and GBPUSD tend to trade within a very\ntight range during these hours. According to the Bank of International Settlement’s\nTriennial FX Survey published in September of 2014, the United Kingdom is the\nmost active trading center, capturing 41% of total volume. Adding in Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Switzerland, European trading as a whole accounts for 50% of\ntotal FX trading. The United States, on the other hand, is only second to the\nUnited Kingdom for the title of most active trading center, but that amounts to only\napproximately 19% of total turnover. This makes the London open exceptionally\nimportant because it gives the majority of traders in the market an opportunity\nto take advantage of events or announcements that may have occurred during\nlate U.S. trading or overnight Asian sessions. This becomes even more critical on\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL118days when the FOMC meets to discuss and announce monetary policy because the\nannouncement occurs at 2:15pm NY Time, after the London close.\nThe British pound trades most actively against the U.S. dollar during the European\nand London trading hours. There is also active trading during the U.S./European\noverlap, but outside those time frames, the pair tends to trade relatively lightly\nbecause the majority of GBPUSD trading is done through UK and European market\nmakers. This provides a great opportunity for day traders to capture the initial\ndirectional intraday real move that occurs within the ﬁrst few hours of London\ntrading. This strategy exploits the common perception that UK traders are notorious\nstop hunters. This means that the initial movement at the London open may not\nalways be the real one. Since UK and European dealers are the primary market\nmakers for the GBPUSD, they have tremendous insight into the extent of actual\nsupply and demand for the pair. The ‘‘waiting for the real deal’’ trading strategy\nﬁrst sets up when interbank dealing desks survey their books at the onset of trading\nand use their client data to trigger close stops on both sides of the markets to gain\nthe pip differential. Once these stops are taken out and the books are cleared, the\nreal directional move in the GBPUSD will begin to occur, at which point we look\nfor the rules of this strategy to be met before entering into a long or short position.\nThis strategy works best following the U.S. open or after a major economic release.\nWith this strategy, you are looking for th e noise in the markets to settle before\ntrading the real trend of the day.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Early European trading in GBPUSD begins around 1am NY Time, and we look\nfor the pair to make new range low of at least 25 pips above the opening price\n(the range is deﬁned as t he price action between the Frankfurt and London\npower hour of 6 GMT to 7 GMT NY Time).\n2. Look for the pair to reverse and penetrate the high.\n3. Place an entry order to buy 10 pips above the high of the range.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range high, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nShorts:\n1. GBPUSD opens in Europe and trades more than 25 pips above the high\nestablished during the Frankfurt to London power hour.\n2. Wait for the pair to reverse and penetrate the low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL1193. When that occurs, place an entry order to sell 10 pips below the low of the\nrange.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range low, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some examples of this strategy in action. Figure 11.1 is\na textbook example of the ‘‘waiting for th e real deal’’ strategy. Between 6 and 7\nGMT, the range high and low for GBPUSD are 1.5359 and 1.5234, respectively. At\nthe start of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upwards, taking\nout the range high of 1.5359. At the time, we place an order to sell GBPUSD 10\npips below the range low at 1.5324. The entry is triggered about an hour and a half\nlater. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35 pips total) at\n1.5359. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5274, or 50 pips below\nthe entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven\nor 1.5324. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at 1.5219\nshortly after the NY open.\nFIGURE 11.1 GBPUSD 5-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL120\nFIGURE 11.2 GBPUSD 10-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 11.3 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL121The next example is shown in Figure 11.2. In this example, the range high and\nlow established between 6 and 7 GMT are 1 .5433 and 1.5399, resp ectively. At the\nstart of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upward, taking out\nthe range high of 1.5433 and racing all the way to 1.5492. At the time, we place an\norder to sell GBPUSD 10 pips below the range low at 1.5389. The entry is triggered\naround the NY open. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35\npips total) at 1.5424. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5339, or 50\npips below the entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to\nbreakeven or 1.5389. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at\n1.5284 after the London open on the following trading day.\nThe third example is shown in Figure 11.3. In this example, the range during the\nFrankfurt London power hour is 1.5187 and 1.5139. At the start of the London\ntrading session, GBPUSD drips lower, breaking below the range low and trading\ndown to 1.5105. When the range low is broken, we place an order to buy GBPUSD\n10 pips below the range high at 1.5197. The entry is triggered around the NY open.\nThe protective stop is placed 25 pips below the range high (35 pips total) at 1.5172.\nA take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5247, or 50 pips below the entry\nprice. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or 1.5197.\nThe second exit is not shown in the chart in Figure 11.3, but the breakeven stop is\ntriggered."

        "123CHAPTER 12\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Inside\nDays Breakout Play\nThroughout this book, volatility trading has been discussed as one of the most\npopular strategies employed by professional traders. There are many ways to\ninterpret changes in volatilities, but one of the simplest strategies is actually a visual\none that requires nothing more than a keen eye. Although this is a strategy that is\nvery popular in the world of professional trading, new traders are frequently amazed\nby its ease, accuracy, and reliability. Breakout traders can identify inside days with\nnothing more than a basic candlestick chart.\nAn inside day is deﬁned as a day where the daily range has been contained within\nthe prior day’s trading range, or in other words, the day’s high and low do not\nexceed the previous day’s high and low. There needs to be at least two inside days\nbefore the volatility play can be implemented. The more inside days, the higher the\nlikelihood of an upside surge in volatility, or a breakout. This type of strategy is best\nemployed on daily charts, but the longer the time frame, the more signiﬁcant the\nbreakout opportunity. Some traders use the inside day strategy on hourly charts,\nwhich works to some success, but identifying inside days on daily charts tends to\nlead to an even greater probability of success. For day traders looking for inside days\non hourly charts, chances of a solid breakout increases if the contraction precedes\nthe London or U.S. market opens. The key is to predict a valid breakout and not\nget caught in a false breakout move. Traders using the daily charts could look for\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY124breakouts ahead of major economic releases for the speciﬁc currency pair. This\nstrategy works with all currencies pairs, but has less frequent instances of false\nbreakouts in the tighter range pairs such as the EURGBP, USDCAD, EURCHF,\nEURCAD, and AUDCAD.\n■Strategy Rules\nLong:\n1. Identify a currency pair where the daily range has been contained within the\nprior day’s range for at least two days (we are looking for multiple inside days).\n2. Buy 10 pips above the high of the previous inside day.\n3. Place stop and reverse order for two lots at least 10 pips below the low of the\nnearest inside day.\n4. Take proﬁt when prices reach double the amount risked or begin to trail stop\nat that level.\nProtect against false breakouts : If the stop and reverse order is triggered, place a stop\nat least 10 pips above the high of the nearest inside day and protect any proﬁts larger\nthan what you risked with a trailing stop.\nShort:\n1. Identify a currency pair where the daily range has been contained within the\nprior day’s range for at least two days (we are looking for multiple inside days).\n2. Sell 10 pips below the low of the previous inside day.\n3. Place stop and reverse order for two lots at least 10 pips above the high of the\nnearest inside day.\n4. Take proﬁt when prices reach double the amount risked or begin to trail stop\nat that level.\nProtect against false breakouts : If the stop and reverse order is triggered, place a stop\nat least 10 pips below the low of the nearest inside day and protect any proﬁts larger\nthan what you risked with a trailing stop.\nFurther Optimization\nFor higher-probability trades, technical formations can be used in conjunction with\nthe visual identiﬁcation to place a higher weight on a speciﬁc direction of the\nbreakout. For example, if the inside days are building and contracting toward the\ntop of a recent range such as a bullish ascending triangle formation, the breakout has\na higher likelihood of occurring to the upside. The opposite scenario is also true; if\ninside days are building and contracting toward the bottom of a recent range and\nwe begin to see that a bearish descending triangle is forming, the breakout has a\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY125higher likelihood of occurring to the downside. Aside from triangles, other technical\nfactors that can be considered include signiﬁcant support and resistance levels. For\nexample, if there are signiﬁcant Fibonacci and moving average support zones resting\nbelow the inside day levels, this either supports a higher likelihood of an upside\nbreakout or at least a higher probability of a false breakout to the downside.\nExamples\nLet us take a look at a few examples. Figure 12.1 is a daily chart of euro against the\nBritish pound, or the EURGBP. The two inside days are identiﬁed on the chart, and\nit is clear visually that each of those days’ ranges, which includes the high and low, is\ncontained within the previous day’s range. In accordance with our rules, we place\nan order to go long 10 pips above the high on the previous inside at 0.6634 and an\norder to sell 10 pips below the low of the previous inside day at 0.6579. Our long\norder gets triggered two bars after the most recent inside day. We then proceed\nto place a stop and reverse order 10 pips below the low of the most recent inside\nday at 0.6579. So basically, we went long at 0.6634 with a stop at 0.6579, which\nmeans that we are risking 45 pips. When prices reached our target level of double\nthe amount risked (90 pips), or 0.6724, we have two choices: to either close out the\nentire trade or begin trailing the stop. More conservative traders should probably\nsquare positions at this point, while more aggressive traders could look for more\n0.6724 Hit\non This Day\nBreaks High\nof Previous\nInside Day\nInside\nDays\nFIGURE 12.1 EURGBP Inside Day Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY126\nInside Days\nStop and Reverse\nOrder Triggered\nStop moved to\nBreakeven\n@0.6560\nFIGURE 12.2 NZDUSD Inside Day Chart\nSource: eSignal\nproﬁt potential. We choose to close out the trade for a 90-pip proﬁt, but those who\nstayed in and weathered a bit of volatility could have taken advantage of another 100\npips of proﬁts three weeks later.\nFigure 12.2 is another example of inside day trading using the daily chart of\nthe New Zealand dollar against the U.S. dollar (or the NZDUSD).

        "123CHAPTER 12\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Inside\nDays Breakout Play\nThroughout this book, volatility trading has been discussed as one of the most\npopular strategies employed by professional traders. There are many ways to\ninterpret changes in volatilities, but one of the simplest strategies is actually a visual\none that requires nothing more than a keen eye. Although this is a strategy that is\nvery popular in the world of professional trading, new traders are frequently amazed\nby its ease, accuracy, and reliability. Breakout traders can identify inside days with\nnothing more than a basic candlestick chart.\nAn inside day is deﬁned as a day where the daily range has been contained within\nthe prior day’s trading range, or in other words, the day’s high and low do not\nexceed the previous day’s high and low. There needs to be at least two inside days\nbefore the volatility play can be implemented. The more inside days, the higher the\nlikelihood of an upside surge in volatility, or a breakout. This type of strategy is best\nemployed on daily charts, but the longer the time frame, the more signiﬁcant the\nbreakout opportunity. Some traders use the inside day strategy on hourly charts,\nwhich works to some success, but identifying inside days on daily charts tends to\nlead to an even greater probability of success. For day traders looking for inside days\non hourly charts, chances of a solid breakout increases if the contraction precedes\nthe London or U.S. market opens. The key is to predict a valid breakout and not\nget caught in a false breakout move. Traders using the daily charts could look for\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY124breakouts ahead of major economic releases for the speciﬁc currency pair. This\nstrategy works with all currencies pairs, but has less frequent instances of false\nbreakouts in the tighter range pairs such as the EURGBP, USDCAD, EURCHF,\nEURCAD, and AUDCAD.\n■Strategy Rules\nLong:\n1. Identify a currency pair where the daily range has been contained within the\nprior day’s range for at least two days (we are looking for multiple inside days).\n2. Buy 10 pips above the high of the previous inside day.\n3. Place stop and reverse order for two lots at least 10 pips below the low of the\nnearest inside day.\n4. Take proﬁt when prices reach double the amount risked or begin to trail stop\nat that level.\nProtect against false breakouts : If the stop and reverse order is triggered, place a stop\nat least 10 pips above the high of the nearest inside day and protect any proﬁts larger\nthan what you risked with a trailing stop.\nShort:\n1. Identify a currency pair where the daily range has been contained within the\nprior day’s range for at least two days (we are looking for multiple inside days).\n2. Sell 10 pips below the low of the previous inside day.\n3. Place stop and reverse order for two lots at least 10 pips above the high of the\nnearest inside day.\n4. Take proﬁt when prices reach double the amount risked or begin to trail stop\nat that level.\nProtect against false breakouts : If the stop and reverse order is triggered, place a stop\nat least 10 pips below the low of the nearest inside day and protect any proﬁts larger\nthan what you risked with a trailing stop.\nFurther Optimization\nFor higher-probability trades, technical formations can be used in conjunction with\nthe visual identiﬁcation to place a higher weight on a speciﬁc direction of the\nbreakout. For example, if the inside days are building and contracting toward the\ntop of a recent range such as a bullish ascending triangle formation, the breakout has\na higher likelihood of occurring to the upside. The opposite scenario is also true; if\ninside days are building and contracting toward the bottom of a recent range and\nwe begin to see that a bearish descending triangle is forming, the breakout has a\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY125higher likelihood of occurring to the downside. Aside from triangles, other technical\nfactors that can be considered include signiﬁcant support and resistance levels. For\nexample, if there are signiﬁcant Fibonacci and moving average support zones resting\nbelow the inside day levels, this either supports a higher likelihood of an upside\nbreakout or at least a higher probability of a false breakout to the downside.\nExamples\nLet us take a look at a few examples. Figure 12.1 is a daily chart of euro against the\nBritish pound, or the EURGBP. The two inside days are identiﬁed on the chart, and\nit is clear visually that each of those days’ ranges, which includes the high and low, is\ncontained within the previous day’s range. In accordance with our rules, we place\nan order to go long 10 pips above the high on the previous inside at 0.6634 and an\norder to sell 10 pips below the low of the previous inside day at 0.6579. Our long\norder gets triggered two bars after the most recent inside day. We then proceed\nto place a stop and reverse order 10 pips below the low of the most recent inside\nday at 0.6579. So basically, we went long at 0.6634 with a stop at 0.6579, which\nmeans that we are risking 45 pips. When prices reached our target level of double\nthe amount risked (90 pips), or 0.6724, we have two choices: to either close out the\nentire trade or begin trailing the stop. More conservative traders should probably\nsquare positions at this point, while more aggressive traders could look for more\n0.6724 Hit\non This Day\nBreaks High\nof Previous\nInside Day\nInside\nDays\nFIGURE 12.1 EURGBP Inside Day Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY126\nInside Days\nStop and Reverse\nOrder Triggered\nStop moved to\nBreakeven\n@0.6560\nFIGURE 12.2 NZDUSD Inside Day Chart\nSource: eSignal\nproﬁt potential.

As such, we choose to opt for an upside breakout trade.\nIn accordance with the rules, we go long 10 pips above the high of the previous\ninside day at 1.6008. Our long trade is triggered, and we place our stop and reverse\norder 10 pips below the low of the most recent inside day at 1.5905. When prices\nmove by double the amount that we risked to 1.6208, we exit the entire position\nfor a 200-pip proﬁt.\nWith the inside day breakout strategy, the risk is generally pretty high if done\non daily charts, but the proﬁt potentials following the breakout are usually fairly\nlarge as well. More aggressive traders can also trade more than one position, which\nwould allow them to lock in proﬁts on the ﬁrst half of the position when prices\nmove by double the amount risked and then trail the stop on the remaining position.\nGenerally these breakout trades are a precursor to big trends, and using trailing\nstops would allow traders to participate in the trend move while also banking\nsome proﬁts."

        "129CHAPTER 13\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Fader\nMore often than not, traders will ﬁnd themselves faced with a potential breakout\nscenario, position for it, and then only end up seeing the trade fail miserably\nand have prices revert back to range trading. In fact, even if prices manage to break\nabove a signiﬁcant level, a continuation move is not guaranteed. If this level is\nvery signiﬁcant, we frequently see interbank dealers or other traders try to push\nprices beyond those levels momentarily in order to run stops. Breakout levels are\nvery signiﬁcant levels and for this very reason, there is no hard fast rule as to\nhow much force is needed to carry prices beyond levels into a sustainable trend.\nTrading breakouts at key levels can involve a lot of risk and as a result, false\nbreakouts appear more frequently than real breakouts. Sometimes prices will test\nthe resistance level once, twice, or even three times before breaking out. This\nhas fostered the development of a large degree of contra-trend traders who look\nonly to fade breakouts in the currency markets. Yet fading every breakout can also\nresult in some signiﬁcant losses because once a real breakout occurs, the trend is\ngenerally strong and long-lasting. So what this boils down to is that traders need a\nmethodology for screening out consolidation patterns for trades that have a higher\npotential of resulting in a false breakout. The following rules provide a good basis\nfor screening such trades. The fader strate gy is a variation of the ‘‘waiting for the\nreal deal’’ strategy. It uses the daily charts to identify the range-bound environment\nand the hourly charts to pinpoint entry levels.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADER130■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1.

Place a trailing stop on the remainder of the position.\nExamples\nLet’s start by taking a look at an example to the short side. Figure 13.1 shows a\ndaily chart of USDJPY with the ADX below 20 and pointing downward. This is the\nﬁrst signal that a trade setup is in place. In this example, the previous day’s high\nis 120.27. We ﬁrst look for a move above the previous day’s high by at least 15\npips, or 120.42. As shown in Figure 13.2 the hourly chart, that move occurs at the\nstart of the European session after which we place an order to sell 5 pips below the\nprevious day’s low of 120.00. The order is ﬁlled a few hours later at 119.95. At the\ntime, we place our stop at 120.15 and a ﬁrst target of 119.75. The ﬁrst target is\nreached, and the stop on the rest of the position is moved to breakeven or 119.95.\nIn this example, the second half of the trade remains live and will either be closed at\nbreakeven, or the stop will be trailed.\nNow let’s take a look at an example to the long side.

        "135CHAPTER 14\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: 20-Day\nBreakout Trade\nTrading breakouts can be both a rewarding and frustrating endeavor as breakouts\nhave a tendency to fail. A major reason why this can occur frequently in the\nforeign exchange market is because it is more technically driven than others and as a\nresult, there are many market participants who intentionally look to break pairs out\nin order to ‘‘suck’’ in other nonsuspecting traders. In an effort to ﬁlter out potential\nfalse breakouts, a price action screener should be used to identify breakouts that\nhave a higher probability of success. The rules behind this strategy are speciﬁcally\ndeveloped to take advantage of strong trending markets that make new highs that\nthen proceed to ‘‘fail’’ by taking out a recent low and then reverse again to make\nanother new high. This type of setup tends to have a very high success rate as it\nallows traders to enter strong trending markets after weaker players have been\nﬂushed out, only to have real money players reenter the market and push the pair\nup to new highs.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day high.\n2. Look for the pair to reverse the same day or next to make a two-day low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE1363. Buy the pair if it takes out the 20-day high within three days of making the\ntwo-day low.\n4. Place the initial stop a few pips below the two-day low.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nShorts:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day low.\n2. That day or the next the pair rallies to make a two-day high.\n3. Sell the pair if it trades below the 20-day low within three days of making the\ntwo-day high.\n4. Risk up to a few ticks above the two-day high.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nExamples\nNow take a look at our ﬁrst example in Figure 14.1. The daily chart of GBPUSD\nshows the currency pair making a new 20-day high on February 5. At this point,\nthe currency pair is on our radar, and we watch for a new two-day low to be made\nFIGURE 14.1 GBPUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE137within the next three days. This occurs right on schedule after which we wait for\nthe currency pair to make a new 20-day high, which occurs on February 12. At the\ntime, we buy GBPUSD a few pips above the previous 20-day high of 1.5352. We\nenter at 1.5360. The stop is placed a few pips below the original two-day low of\n1.5197 (or 1.5190). As the currency pair moves in our favor, we look to exit half\nof the position when it moves by the amount that we risked, which is 155 pips or\n1.5507. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or the\ninitial entry price of 1.5352. This rest of the trade is exited 24 hours later.\nFigure 14.2 provides an example of how the strategy can work in the EURUSD\nto the short side. On December 23, the currency pair makes a new 20-day low of\n1.2165. It goes on radar and we start looking for the currency pair to rebound within\nthe next three days. The recovery occurs the following day, and a new two-day\nhigh is made. Then we look for the previous 20-day low to be broken within the\nfollowing three days and that occurs shortly thereafter. At which point we enter\na short EURUSD trade at 1.2155 with a stop at 1.2260, or a few pips above the\ntwo-day high of 1.2254. Our risk on the trade is 105 pips. When the currency pair\ndrops to 1.2050, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. Then we trail the stop using a 2-bar high and end up exiting the\nremainder of the position at 1.1846.\nThe ﬁnal example shown in Figure 14.3 is in AUDUSD. The currency starts by\nmaking a new 20-day low on January 26. It goes on radar and we start looking\nfor the currency pair to rebound within the next three days. The recovery occurs\nFIGURE 14.2 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE138\nFIGURE 14.3 AUDUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nintraday, and a new two-day high is made right on schedule. Then we look for the\nprevious 20-day low to be broken within the following three days it occurs 24 hours\nafter the two-day high is made. At which point we enter a short AUDUSD trade a\nfew pips below the 20-day low at 0.7850 with a stop at 0.8032, or a few pips above\nthe two-day high of 0.8025. Our risk on the trade is 182 pips. When the currency\npair drops to 0.7668, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. The breakeven stop is triggered the very same day that the ﬁrst\ntarget is reached.\n139CHAPTER 15\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Channels\nChannel trading is a less exotic but popular trading technique for currencies. The\nreason why it can work is because currencies rarely spend much time in tight\ntrading ranges and have the tendency to develop strong trends. By reviewing a few\ncharts, traders can see that channels can easily be identiﬁed and occur frequently.\nA common scenario would be channel trading during the Asian session and a\nbreakout in either the London or U.S. session. There are many instances where\neconomic releases are one of the most common triggers for a break of the channel.\nTherefore, it is imperative that traders keep on top of economic releases. If a channel\nhas formed and a big U.S. number (per say) is expected to be released, and the\ncurrency pair is at the top of a channel, the probability of a break is high, so traders\nshould be looking to buy the break out, not fade it.\nChannels are created when we draw a trendline, and then draw a line that is\nparallel to that trendline. Most if not all of the price activity of the currency pair\nshould fall between the two channel lines. We will seek to identify situations where\nthe price is trading within a narrow channel, and then trade in the direction of a\nbreakout from the channel. This strategy can be particularly effective when used\nprior to a fundamental market event such as the release of major economic news, or\nprior to the ‘‘open’’ of a major ﬁnancial market.\nHere are some rules for using this technique to ﬁnd long trades:\n1. First, identify a channel on either an intraday or daily chart. The price should\nbe contained within a narrow range.\n2. Enter long as the price breaks above the upper channel line by 10 pips.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS1403. Place a stop at the lower channel line.\n4. Exit the position when it moves by double the amount risked.\nThe short rules are the reverse.\n■Examples\nLet examine a few examples. The ﬁrst example is a USDCAD 15-minute chart\nshown in Figure 15.1. The total range of the channel is approximately 30 pips with\nthe low being 1.2028 and the high 1.2056. In accordance with our strategy, we\nplace entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at 1.2018 and 1.2066. The\norder to buy gets triggered ﬁrst, and almost immediately we place a stop order\nat the low of the channel or 1.2028, which means we are risking 38 pips on the\ntrade. USDCAD then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of double the range at\n1.2142. More conservative traders could exit half of the position when it moves by\nthe amount risked, or 38 pips, and trail the stop on the remainder of the position.\nThe next example shown in Figure 15.2 is a 15-minute chart of EURGBP. The\ntotal range between the two lines is 12 p ips with the low being 0.7148 and the high\n0.7160. In accordance with our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and\nbelow the channel at 0.7138 and 0.7170. The order to buy gets triggered ﬁrst and\nalmost immediately we place a stop at the low of the channel or 0.7160 for 10-pip\nrisk. EURGBP then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of 20 pips or double\nthe amount risked.\nFIGURE 15.1 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS141\nFIGURE 15.2 EURGBP 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 15.3 EURUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFigure 15.3 is a 15-minute chart of the EURUSD. The total range during this\nfour-hour period is 18 pips with a high of 1.1206 and a low of 1.1188. In accordance\nwith our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at\n1.1216 and 1.1178. The order to sell gets triggered ﬁrst and almost immediately,\nwe place a stop order at the channel high of 1.1206 for a risk of 28 pips. The\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS142EURUSD then proceeds to sell off signiﬁcantly but only makes it to a low of 1.1132\nbefore stopping us out a few days later. We chose to show this example because it\nexplains why the more conservative approach of exiting half of the position when it\nmoves by the amount risk is more desirable, even though it has worse risk reward.\nA move of 58 pips is sizable on an intraday basis and may be difﬁcult to achieve.\nWhenever the risk is greater than 20 pips, it may be more prudent to exit half and\ntrail the stop.\n143CHAPTER 16\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Perfect\nOrder\nAperfect order in moving averages is deﬁned as a set of moving averages that\nis in sequential order. For an uptrend, a perfect order would be a situation\nin which the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) is at a higher price level than\nthe 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 50-day SMA. Meanwhile, the 100-day\nSMA would be below the 50-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA would be below\nthe 100-day SMA. In a downtrend, the opposite is true, where the 200-day SMA is\nat the highest level and the 10-day SMA is at the lowest level. Having the moving\naverages stacked up in sequential order are generally a strong indicator of a trending\nenvironment. Not only does it indicate that the momentum is on the side of trend,\nbut the moving averages also serve as multiple levels of support. To optimize the\nperfect order strategy, traders should also look for ADX to be greater than 20 and\ntrending upward. This represents a strong trend. Entry and exit levels are difﬁcult\nto determine with this strategy, but genera l l ys p e a k i n g ,w ew a n tt os t a yi nt h et r a d e\nfor as long as the perfect order remains in place and exit once the perfect order no\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER144longer holds. Perfect orders do not happen often, and the premise of this strategy is\nto capture the perfect order when it ﬁrst happens.\nThe perfect order seeks to take advantage of a trending environment near the\nbeginning of the trend:\n1. Look for a currency pair with moving averages in perfect order.\n2. Look for ADX pointing upwards, ideally greater than 20.\n3. Buy ﬁve candles after the initial formation of the perfect order (if it still\nholds).\n4. Initial stop is the low on the day of the initial crossover for longs and the high\nfor shorts.\n5. Exit the position when the perfect order no longer holds.\n■Examples\nFigure 16.1 is a daily chart of the EURUSD. In August 2014, the moving averages\nin the EURUSD formed a sequential perfect order. We check and see that ADX is\ngreater than 20, and we look to enter into a short trade ﬁve candles after the initial\nformation at 1.3390. Our initial stop is placed at the August 8 high of 1.3432. The\npair continues to move lower in the days and weeks that follow, and we remain in\nthe trade until the moving averages are no longer in perfect and the 10-day SMA\nmoves above the 20-day SMA, which occurs on October 17 when EURUSD settles\nthe day at 1.2758. The total proﬁt on this trade is 632 pips. We risked 42 pips on\nthe trade.\nThe next example is USDSGD. In Figure 16.2, the perfect order forms on\nNovember 6. We check and see that ADX is greater than 20, and we look to enter\ninto a long trade ﬁve candles after the initial formation at 1.2916. Our stop should\nbe at the November 6 low of 1.2911 but that is below our entry price so we put\nour stop at the 20-day SMA of 1.2822. The pair continues to move higher in the\nmonths that follow, and we remain in the trade until the moving averages are no\nlonger in perfect and the 10-day SMA moves below the 20-day SMA, which occurs\non March 27, when USD/SGD closes the day at 1.3685. The total move on this\ntrade is 770 pips for a risk of 89 pips.\nFigure 16.3 shows a perfect-order formation on a daily chart in USDJPY. The\nperfect order formed in October and when that occurred, we entered the trade\nﬁve days afterward at 116.20. Our stop was placed at 108.75, and we remained in\nthe trade until the 10-day SMA crossed below the 20-day SMA on December 19 at\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk145\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.1 EURUSD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk146\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.2 USDSGD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk147\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.3 USDJPY Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER148119.45. In this example, the proﬁt was 425 pips for a risk of 645 pips, which was\nfar from ideal.\nThe perfect order is a strategy that can be high proﬁt but low probability and\nlow frequency. This means there could be numerous stop outs before a long trend\nemerges. Also, when the currency pair moves more than 250 to 300 pips in proﬁt,\nyou may want to consider taking proﬁt on part of the positions.\n149CHAPTER 17\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nPairing Strong with\nWeak\nOne of the best ways to approach currency trading on a fundamental basis\nis to pair the strongest currency with the weakest. Of course ﬁnding that\npairing is rarely simple because it is not just about which countries are the strongest\nor weakest right now but instead which ones will become strong or weak going\nforward. Finding these currencies can also be challenging because we live in a global\neconomy where the health of one major economy will affect the outlook of another.\nYet buying a weak currency and selling a strong one unknowingly can be a big\nmistake that translates into large losses, so it is extremely important for forex traders\nto learn how to pair strong with weak to maximize returns. After doing so you can\nuse technical analysis to help identify points of entry in the direction of the trend.\nIn 2015, for example, the European Central Bank introduced quantitative easing\n(QE) as a last ditch effort to boost inﬂation and stimulate growth. We know that\nQE lowers interest rates and erodes the value of a currency but selling euros blindly\non March 9, 2015, when the central bank started buying bonds for the very ﬁrst\ntime, yielded only a short-lived decline in the currency. Instead it would have been\nsmarter to look for opportunities to sell the currency against a strong one on rallies.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK150\nFIGURE 17.1 EURGBP Daily Chart—Quantitative Easing\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 17.2 NZDCAD Daily Chart—Oil\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK151One good candidate at the time was the British pound, which was beneﬁting from\neconomic improvements and had a central bank that was moving closer to raising\nrates. Figure 17.1 shows how there was a lot of consolidation in EURGBP near\n74 cents prior to the launch of Eurozone quantitative easing. This level proved to\nbe resistance when the pair rallied in late March. Traders could have sold them,\nassuming that resistance would hold, or waited for the pair to revisit that level in\nApril and May.\nAnother way to pair strong with weak is to follow the direction of commodity\nprices. Oil prices bottomed at $43.46 in early 2015, having traded above $100 a\nbarrel only 8 months earlier and started to turn higher in March. As a major oil\nproducer, Canada would stand to beneﬁt from stabilization in crude prices. At the\ntime U.S. policy makers were talking about raising interest rates, the Australian\ndollar was beneﬁtting from improving domestic conditions, and sterling soared on\npositive data and a victory by the incumbent during the 2015 general election.\nSelling any of these currencies and buying the Canadian dollar would have been a\nrisky endeavor. Instead the best bet at th e time was to sell the New Zealand dollar\nand buy the Canadian dollar or the NZDCAD pair because New Zealand reported\nextremely weak labor data that prompted policy makers to talk about easing. As\nyou can see in Figure 17.2, NZDCAD started to turn lower just as oil prices moved\nhigher in March.\nFIGURE 17.3 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK152The best way to gauge strong versus weak is to monitor economic data surprises.\nWhile the ECB was buying bonds and implementing quantitative easing, Eurozone\ndata started to improve and U.S. data started to weaken. The market had not\nanticipated this shift in dynamic as they had been looking for weak Eurozone data to\nreinforce QE and stronger U.S. data to push the Fed to tighten. This unexpected\nchange drove EURUSD sharply higher, and buying breakouts in April and May as\nshown in Figure 17.3 would have been good bets.\n153CHAPTER 18\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nThe Leveraged\nCarry Trade\nThe leverage carry trade strategy is the quintessential global macro trade that\nhas long been one of the favorite strategies of hedge funds and investment\nbanks. On its most fundamental level, the carry trade strategy involves buying\na high-yielding currency and funding it with the sale of a low-yielding currency.\nAggressive speculators will leave the trade unhedged with the hope that the high\nyielding currency will appreciate in value relative to the lower yielding currency,\nallowing them to earn the interest rate differential on top of the capital appreciation.\nMore conservative investors may choose to hedge the exchange rate component,\nearning only the interest rate differential. Although the differentials tend to be small,\nusually 1 to 3 percent if the position is leveraged 5 to 10 times, the proﬁts from\ninterest rates alone can be substantial. Of course it is important to remember that\nwhile leverage can magnify proﬁts, it can also exacerbate losses. Capital appreciation\ngenerally occurs when a number of traders identify proﬁt opportunities and pile into\nthe same trade, driving up the value of the currency pair.\nIn foreign exchange trading, the carry trade is a popular way to take advantage\nof the notion that money ﬂows in and out of different markets, driven by the law\nof supply and demand: with markets offering higher rates of return on investment\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE154attracting the most capital. Countries are no different—in the world of international\ncapital ﬂows, nations that offer the highest interest rates will generally attract more\ninvestment creating greater demand for their currencies. This helps to fuel the\ncarry trade. The carry trade strategy is simple to master, but like all strategies,\nit contains risk. Carry trades perf ormed extremely well between 2000 and 2007,\nfailed miserably between 2008 and 2009, and recovered between late 2012 into\n2015. The chance of loss can be great if you do not understand how, why, and when\ncarry trades work best.\n■How Do Carry Trades Work?\nTo understand carry trading, it is important to ﬁrst understand that currencies are\nalways traded in pairs, so taking a carry trade involves buying a currency that offers\na high interest rate and simultaneously selling a currency that offers a low interest\nrate. Carry trades are proﬁtable when the exchange rate remains unchanged in\nvalue and investors are able to earn the d ifference in interes t—or spread—between\nthe two currencies, or when it appreciates in value, allowing the investor to earn\nthe spread along with capital appreciation. If the exchange rate falls by more than\nthe spread on the interest rate, it becomes a net loss for the investor.\nLet’s take a look at an example: Assume that the Australian dollar offers an\ninterest rate of 4.75%, while the Swiss franc offers an interest rate of 0.25%. To\nexecute the carry trade, an investor buys the Australian dollar and sells the Swiss\nfranc. In doing so, he or she can earn a proﬁt of 4.50% (2.75% in interest earned\nminus 0.25% in interest paid), as long as the exchange rate between Australian\ndollars and Swiss francs do not change. Figure 18.1 shows exactly how an investor\nwould execute the carry trade.\nLong Short\nBuy AUD\n4.75%Sell CHF\n0.25%Investor\nReceives: 4.75% from long AUD\nposition\nPays: 0.25% through short USD\nfunding position\nProfit: 4.50% in interest rate\nspread, assuming spot rate is \nconstantEnters long AUD/USD trade:\nFIGURE 18.1 Leveraged Carry Trade Example\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE155To summarize : A carry trade involves buying a currency that offers a high interest\nrate while selling a currency that offers a low interest rate.\n■Why Do Carry Trades Work?\nInterest rates are very important: Carry trades work because of the constant\nmovement of capital into and out of different countries in search of the highest yield.\nInterest rates are the main reason why some countries attract more investment\nthan others. There are three reasons why a country can pay a higher interest rate.\nFirst, if a country’s economy is doing well (high growth, high productivity, low\nunemployment, rising incomes, etc.), it will be able to offer those who invest in the\ncountry a higher rate of return. Second, central banks can raise interest rates on fast\ngrowing economies with rising inﬂation. Third, countries with high debt to GDP\nratios, low credit ratings, and/or inherent growth problems may also need to pay a\nhigher interest rate to attract investment.\nInvestors prefer to earn higher interest rates: Investors who are interested in\nmaximizing their proﬁts will naturally look for investments that offer them the\nhighest rate of return. When making a decision to invest in a particular currency, an\ninvestor is more likely to choose one that offers the highest rate of return, or in this\ncase, interest rate. If several investors make this exact same decision, the country\nwill experience an inﬂow of capital from those seeking to earn a high rate of return,\nand the currency should appreciate.\nWhat about countries that are not doing well economically? Countries that have\nlow growth and low productivity will not be able to offer investors a high rate of\nreturn unless they have a very poor credit rating and are forced to offer a higher\nrate to compensate for the risk of holding the country’s bond or currency. With\nmajor economies, however, there will be times where growth is so weak that\ninterest rates are brought to zero, providing investors with no meaningful return.\nThe difference between countries that offer h igh interest rates versus countries that\noffer low interest rates is what makes carry trades possible.\nLet’s take another look at the carry trade example above in more detail.\nImagine an investor in Switzerland who is earning an interest rate of 0.25% per\nyear on her bank deposit in Swiss francs. At the time, a bank in Australia is offering\n4.75% per year on a deposit of Australian dollars. Seeing that interest rates are much\nhigher with the Australian bank, this in vestor would like to ﬁnd a way to earn this\nhigher rate of interest on her money.\nNow imagine that the investor could somehow trade her deposit of Swiss francs\nby paying 0.25% for a deposit of Australian dollars paying 4.75%. What she has\neffectively done is to ‘‘sell’’ her Swiss franc deposit and use those funds to ‘‘buy’’ an\nAustralian dollar deposit. With this transaction, she now owns an Australian dollar\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE156Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.2 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 1\ndeposit that pays her 4.75% in interest per year, 4.50% more than she was earning\nwith her Swiss franc deposit.\nThis investor has essentially just done a carry trade by ‘‘buying’’ an Australian\ndollar deposit, and ‘‘selling’’ a Swiss franc deposit.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows out of\nSwitzerland and into Australia, as investors take their Swiss francs and convert them\ninto Australian dollars. Australia attracts more capital because of the higher rates it\noffers. This inﬂow of capital increases the value of the currency (see Figure 18.2).\nTo summarize : Carry trades are made possible by the differences in interest rates\nbetween countries. B ecause they prefer to ea rn higher interest ra tes, investors will\nlook to buy and hold high interest rate paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Work Best?\nThere will be times when carry trades work better than others. In fact, carry trades\nare the most proﬁtable when there is a very speciﬁc attitude toward risk.\n■How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take?\nThe moods of people in general change over time—sometimes they may feel more\ndaring and willing to take chances; other times they may be more timid and prone to\nconservativeness. Investors, as a group, are no different. Sometimes they are willing\nto make investments that involve a good amount of risk; other times they are more\nfearful of losses and look to invest in safer assets.\nIn ﬁnancial jargon, when investors as a whole are willing to take on risk, we\ncall this low risk aversion, which means they are in risk-seeking mode. Alternatively,\nwhen investors are drawn to more conservative investments and less willing to take\no nr i s k ,w ed e s c r i b et h e ma s risk-averse .\nCarry trades are the most proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion .T h i s\nnotion makes sense when you consider what a carry trade involves. Remember, a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE157carry trade involves buying a currency that pays a high interest rate while selling a\ncurrency that pays a low interest rate. In buying the high interest rate currency, the\ninvestor is taking a risk because it is believed that a country needs to offer a higher\ninterest rate to offset the risk of holding th e currency. Also, while high interest rates\nattract investment, they can also hurt growth by raising the cost of borrowing. This\ncreates uncertainty around whether the economy of the country will continue to\nperform well and be able to pay not just high but even higher interest rates. This\nrisk is something a carry trade investor must be willing to take.\nIf investors as a whole were not willing to take on this risk, then capital would\nnever move from one country to another, and the carry trade opportunity would\nnot exist. Therefore, in order to return, carry trades require that investors as a\ngroup have low risk aversion, or be willing to bear the risk of investing in the higher\ninterest rate currency.\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the most proﬁtable when investors are willing\nto bear the risk of investing in high interest paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Not Work?\nSo far, we have shown that a carry trade will work best when investors have low\nrisk aversion. What happens when investors have high risk aversion ?\nCarry trades are the least proﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion .W h e n\ninvestors have high risk aversion, they are less willing as a group to take chances\nwith their investments. This means they would be less willing to invest in riskier\ncurrencies that offer higher interest rates. Instead, when investors have high risk\naversion they would actually prefer to put their money in ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies\nthat pay lower interest rates. During this time, they may also opt to close or unwind\ntheir carry trades. In doing so, they would be buying the currency with the low\ninterest rate and selling the curre ncy with the high interest rate.\nReturning to our earlier example, let’s assume the investor suddenly feels\nuncomfortable holding the foreign currency, the Australian dollar. Now, instead of\nlooking for the higher interest rate, she is more interested in keeping her investment\nsafe. As a result, she swaps her Australian dollars for more familiar Swiss francs.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows\nout of Australia and into Switzerland as investors take their Australian dollars and\nconvert them into Swiss francs. During this period of risk aversion, Switzerland\nattracts more capital due to the perceived safety of its currency, and the inﬂow of\ncapital increases the value of the Swiss franc (see Figure18.3).\nWhen investors have high risk aversion, they prefer to avoid the riskier high\ninterest rate paying currency and instea d invest in the safer, lower interest rate\npaying currency, which is the opposite of a carry trade.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE158Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.3 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 2\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the least proﬁtable in periods of uncertainty\nwhen investors are unwilling to bear the risk of investing in high interest paying\ncurrencies.\n■The Importance of Risk Aversion\nCarry trades will generally be proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion, and\nunproﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion. So before placing a carry trade\nit is important to understand the risk environment—whether investors as a whole\nhave high or low risk aversion—and when it changes .\nRising risk aversion is generally beneﬁcial for low interest rate paying currencies:\nSometimes the mood of investors will change rapidly, and investors’ willingness\nto make risky trades can change dramatically from one moment to the next.\nOften, these large shifts are caused by signiﬁcant global events. When periods\nof risk aversion occur quickly, the result is generally a large capital inﬂow into\nlow-interest-rate-paying ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies (see Figure 18.2).\nFor example, in the summer of 1998 the Japanese yen appreciated against the\ndollar by more than 20% over the span of two months, due to the Russian debt\ncrisis and LTCM hedge fund bailout. Similarly, just after the September 11 terrorist\nattacks the Swiss franc rose by more than 7% against the dollar over a 10-day period.\nDuring the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, we also saw big gains in the yen and the\nSwiss franc.\nThese sharp movements in currency values often occur when risk aversion quickly\nchanges from low to high. As a result, when risk aversion shifts, a carry trade can\nturn from being proﬁtable to unproﬁtable very quickly.\nRisk Aversion and Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nAs investor risk aversion goes from high to low, carry trades become more proﬁtable\nas detailed in Figure 18.4.\nHow do you know if investors as a whole have high or low risk aversion?\nUnfortunately, it is difﬁcult to measure investor risk aversion with a single number.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE1591 .

The\nwider the spread between the yields of bonds from different countries with similar\ncredit ratings, the higher the investor risk aversion. Bond yields are readily available\non major ﬁnancial websites such as Bloomberg.com and Reuters.com. In addition,\nseveral large banks have developed their own measures of risk aversion that signal\nwhen investors are willing to take risk and when they are not.\nOther Things to Bear in Mind When Considering a Carry Trade\nWhile risk aversion is one of the most important things to consider before making\na carry trade, it is not the only one. The following are some additional issues to be\naware of.\nLow Interest Rate Currency Appreciation\nBy entering into a carry trade, an investor is able to earn a proﬁt from the interest\nrate difference, or spread, between a high interest rate currency and a low interest\nrate currency. However, the carry trade can turn unproﬁtable if for some reason\n(like the risk aversion examples earlier), the low interest rate currency appreciates\nby a signiﬁcant amount.\nAside from rising risk aversion, improving economic conditions within a low\ninterest paying country can also cause its currency to appreciate. An ideal carry trade\nwill involve a low interest currency whose economy is weak and has low expectations\nfor growth. If the economy were to improve, however, the country might then be\nable to offer investors a higher rate of return through increased interest rates. If this\nwere to occur—again, using the previous example, say that Switzerland increased\nthe interest rates it offered—then investors may take advantage of these higher rates\nby investing in Swiss francs. As seen in Figure 18.3, an appreciation of the Swiss franc\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE160would negatively affect the proﬁtability of the Australian dollar–Swiss franc carry\ntrade. (At the very least, higher interest rates in Switzerland would negatively affect\nthe carry trade’s proﬁtability by lowering the interest rate spread.)\nThis same sequence of events may currently be unfolding for the Japanese yen.\nGiven its zero interest rates, the Jap anese yen has for a very long time been an\nideal low interest rate currency to use in carry trades (known as yen carry trades ).\nThis situation however, may be changing. Increased optimism about the Japanese\neconomy has recently led to an increase in the Japanese stock market. Increased\ninvestor demand for Japanese stocks and currency has caused the yen to appreciate,\nand this yen appreciation negatively affects the proﬁtability of carry trades like\nAustralian dollar (high interest rate) versus Japanese yen.\nIf investors continue to buy the yen, the yen carry trade could start to become\nunproﬁtable. This further illustrates the fact that when the low interest rate currency\nin a carry trade (the currency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the\nproﬁtability of the overall carry trade position.\nTrade Balances\nA country’s trade balance (the differen ce between imports and exports) can also\naffect the proﬁtability of a carry trade. We know that when investors have low\nrisk aversion or are risk seeking, capital will ﬂow from the low interest rate paying\ncurrency to the high interest rate paying currency (see Figure 18.2) but this does\nnot always happen.\nOne reason is because countries with large trade surplus can still see their\ncurrencies appreciate in low risk environments because running a trade surplus\nmeans that the country exports more than it imports. This creates naturally demand\nfor the currency.\nThe point of this example is to show that even when investors have low risk\naversion, large trade imbalances can cause a low interest rate currency to appreciate\n(as in Figure 18.3). And when the low interest rate currency in a carry trade (the\ncurrency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the proﬁtability of the carry\ntrade.\nTime Horizon\nIn general, a carry trade is a long-term strategy. Before entering into a carry trade,\nan investor should be willing to commit to a time-horizon of at least six months. This\ncommitment helps to make sure that the trade will not be affected by the ‘‘noise’’\nof shorter-term currency price movements.\nTo summarize : Carry trade investors should be aware of factors such as currency\nappreciation, trade balances, and time horizon before placing a trade. Any or all of\nthese factors can cause a seemingly proﬁtable carry trade to become unproﬁtable.\n161CHAPTER 19\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nMacro Event Driven\nTrade\nShort-term traders are generally focused only on the economic release of the\nweek and how it will impact their day trading activities. This works well for\nmany traders, but it is also important not to lose sight of the big macro events\nthat may be brewing in the economy or the world for that matter. Large-scale\nmacroeconomic events will move markets and will move them in very big ways.\nTheir impact goes beyond a simple one- or two-day price change because depending\non their size and scope, these occurrences have the potential to reshape the\nfundamental perception toward a currency for months or even years at a time.\nEvents such as wars, political uncertainly, natural disasters, and major international\nmeetings or monetary policy changes are so potent due to their irregularity that they\ncan have widespread psychological and physical impacts on the currency market.\nWith these events come both currencies that appreciate vastly and currencies that\ndepreciate just as dramatically. Therefore, keeping on top of global developments,\nunderstanding the underlying direction of market sentiment before and after these\nevents occur and anticipating them could be very proﬁtable, or at least can help\nprevent signiﬁcant losses.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE162■Know When Big Events Occur: Here Is a List\nof a Few Important Ones\n■Signiﬁcant G7 ﬁnance ministers meetings\n■Presidential elections\n■Important summits\n■Major Central Bank meetings\n■Potential changes to currency regimes\n■Possible debt defaults by large countries\n■Possible wars as a result of rising geopolitical tensions\n■Federal Reserve chairman’s semiannual testimony on economy\nThe best way to highlight the signiﬁcance of these events is look at a few notable\nmacroeconomic examples from the past two decades.\n2014 Ukraine–Russia Crisis\nThe 2014 Ukraine–Russia crisis was one of the biggest geopolitical events of the\npast decade. The crisis began in 2013 but didn’t really hit its peak until March\n2014 when Russia signed a bill to absorb Crimea. Leading up to the announcement,\nthe uncertainty put signiﬁcant pressure on the EURUSD in January 2014 with the\ncurrency pair dropping sharply on March 18, 2014, the day that Russia declared that\nCrimea was now ofﬁcially apart of their country. This led to a few more weeks of\ndownward pressure for the EURUSD as shown in Figure 19.1 as investors awaited\nthe world’s response. Many nations declared their support for Ukraine and war was\nfeared, but eventually Russia was only hit with sanctions, and a few months later,\nthe Ukraine crisis moved to the back burner.\nEuropean Sovereign Debt Crisis (2009–2013)\nThe European Sovereign Debt Crisis started in 2009 and lasted into 2013 with the bulk\nof the damage being done by February 2012. It was a multiyear debt crisis that was\nsparked by the inability of many member nations to meet their debt obligations after\nthe global ﬁnancial crisis. Their banking sectors and economies suffered signiﬁcant\nlosses, and persistently negative growth prospects made it impossible for countries\nsuch as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus to repay or reﬁnance their government\ndebt. Between 2010 and 2012, all of these na tions required bailouts or some form\nof support from the Troika, composed of the ECB, IMF and European Commission.\nWhile the problems were concentrated in smaller Eurozone nations, there was fear\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE163\nFIGURE 19.1 EURUSD Ukraine Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE164\nFIGURE 19.2 EURUSD Sovereign Debt Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nof contagion for the major economies. The country of Spain did not require a bailout\nbut in 2012, a number of banks required additional funding. The crisis posed caused\nsigniﬁcant volatility for the euro. Figure 19.2 shows two long periods of EURUSD\nweakness that were caused by bailouts, downgrades, and other negative headlines.\nGlobal Financial Crisis (2007–2009), Subprime\nOne of the most important macroeconomic events of the twenty-ﬁrst century was\nthe 2007 to 2009 subprime/global ﬁnancial crisis. It was triggered by a sharp slide\nin house prices, default on mortgages, and blowup of subprime mortgage backed\nsecurities and collateralized debt obligations. This, in turn, caused massive losses for\nbanks and ﬁnancial institutions, leading the failure of major ﬁrms such as Lehman\nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns. The impact on the ﬁnancial market and\nthe economy was staggering, with many countries falling into recession. During this\nperiod, the stock market lost more than 50% of its value with the S&P 500, falling\nfrom a high of 1,565 in October 2007 to a low of 676 in March 2009. As shown in\nFigure 19.3, USDJPY dropped from a high of 116.47 in October 2007 to a low of\n87.13 in January 2009. This was only the beginning of a multiyear decline for the\ncurrency pair. EURUSD had a delayed reaction, rallying strongly between October\n2007 and April 2008 as money ﬂowed out of the U.S. economy, and then falling\nsharply between July 2008 and October 2008 as the risk aversion and crisis spread\nto Europe.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE165\nFIGURE 19.3 USDJPY Global Financial Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nPolitical Uncertainty: 2004 U.S. Presidential Election\nAnother example of major events impacting the currency market is the 2004 U.S.\npresidential elections. In general, political instability causes perceived weakness\nin currencies. The hotly contested presidential election in November of 2004,\ncombined with the differences in the candidates’ stance on the growing budget\ndeﬁcit, resulted in overall dollar bearishness. The sentiment was exacerbated even\nfurther, given the lack of international support for the incumbent President (Bush)\ndue to the administration’s decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein. As a result, in\nthe three weeks leading up to the election, the euro rose 600 pips against the U.S.\ndollar. This can be seen in Figure 19.4. With a Bush victory becoming increasingly\nclear and later conﬁrmed, the dollar sold off against the majors as the market looked\nahead to what would probably end up being the maintenance of status quo. On the\nday following the election, the EURUSD rose another 200 pips and then continued\nto rise an additional 700 pips before peaking out six weeks later. This entire move\ntook place over the course of two months, which may seem like an eternity for\nmany, but this macroeconomic event really shaped the markets and for those who\nwere following it, big proﬁts could have been made. However, this is important\neven for short-term traders because given that the market was bearish dollars in\ngeneral leading up to the U.S. presidential election, a more prudent trade would be\nto look for opportunities to buy the EURUSD on dips rather than trying sell rallies\nand look for tops.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE166\nPost Election -\nAnother 700\nPip Rally \n600 Pip Rally\nPre Election\n2004 Election\nNight\nFIGURE 19.4 EURUSD Election Trade\nSource: eSignal\nG7 Meeting Dubai September 2003\nThe G7 ﬁnance ministers meeting on September 22, 2003, was a very important\nturning point for the markets. The dollar collapsed signiﬁcantly following the meeting\nat which the G7 ﬁnance ministers wanted to see ‘‘more ﬂexibility in exchange rates.’’\nDespite the rather tame nature of these words, the market interpreted this line to be\na major shift in policy. The last time changes to this degree had been made was back in\n2000. Taking a step back, the countries that constitute the G7 are the United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, and France. Collectively, these\ncountries account for two-thirds of the world’s total economic output. Not all G7\nmeetings are important. The only time the market really hones in on the G7 ﬁnance\nministers meeting is when they expect big changes to be made to the statement. In\n2000, the market paid particular attention to the upcoming meeting because there\nwas strong intervention in the EURUSD the day before the meeting. The meeting\nin September 2003 was also important because the U.S. trade deﬁcit was ballooning\nand becoming a huge issue. The EURUSD bore the brunt of the dollar depreciation\nwhile Japan and China were intervening aggressively in their currencies. As a result,\nit was widely expected that the G7 ﬁnance ministers as a whole would issue a\nstatement that was highly critical of Japan and China’s intervention policies. Leading\nup to the meeting, the U.S. dollar had alre ady begun to sell off as indicated by the\nchart. At the time of the announcement, the EURUSD shot up 150 pips. Though\nthis initial move was not ve ry substantial, between Se ptember 2003 and February\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE167\n6% Rally\n14% Rally\nSept 22, 2003\nG7 Meeting\nFIGURE 19.5 EURUSD G7 Meeting\nSource: eSignal\n2004 (which was the next G7 meeting), the dollar fell 8% on a trade-weighted\nbasis, 9% against the British pound, 11% against the euro, 7% against the yen,\nand 1.5% against the Canadian dollar. To put the percentages into perspective, a\nmove of 11% is equivalent to approximately 1100 pips. Therefore, the longer-term\nimpact is much more signiﬁcant than the immediate impact as the event itself has the\nsigniﬁcance to change the overall sentiment in the market. Figure 19.5 is a weekly\nchart of the EURUSD that illustrates how the currency pair performed following\nthe September 22, 2003 G7 meeting.\nU.S. War Against Iraq\nGeopolitical risks such as wars can also have a pronounced impact on the currency\nmarket. Figure 19.6 shows that bet ween December 2002 and February 2003, the\ndollar depreciated 9% against the Swiss franc (USDCHF) in the months leading up\nto war. The dollar sold off because the war itself was incredibly unpopular among\nthe international community. The Swiss franc was one of the primary beneﬁciaries\ndue to the country’s political neutrality an d safe-haven status. Between February\nand March, traders began to believe that the inevitable war would turn into a quick\nand decisive U.S. victory, so they began to unwind the war trade. This eventually\nled to a 3% rally in USDCHF as investors exited their short dollar positions.\nEach of these events caused large-scale movements in the currency market. Such\nevents are clearly important to follow for all types of traders. Keeping abreast of\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE168\nFIGURE 19.6 USDCHF Iraq War\nSource: eSignal\nbroad macroeconomic events can help traders make smarter decisions and prevent\nthem from fading large factors that may be brewing in the background. Most of\nthese events are talked about, debated, and anticipated many months in advance by\neconomists, currency analysts, and the international community in general.\n169CHAPTER 20\nQuantitative Easing\nand Its Impact on\nForex\nQuantitative easing is such an important topic that it deserves its own chapter.\nAfter the global ﬁnancial crisis many countries fell into recession, and in\nresponse central banks around the world lowered interest rates to record lows.\nWhen rates could not fall any lower, they had to resort to unprecedented measures,\nthe most powerful of which was quantit ative easing (QE). Between 2007 and 2015,\nthe Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and\nthe Swedish National Bank all resorted to QE, and their decision had a signiﬁcant\nimpact on their currencies on both a short- and long-term basis.\nThe goal of quantitative easing is to keep yields low and to ﬂood the market\nwith liquidity. To do so, a central bank would create money by buying ﬁnancial\nassets such as government bonds from banks using electronic cash. This basically\n‘‘creates new money.’’ It also keeps yields low because bond prices have an inverse\nrelationship with yields and in giving banks money, the hope is that it will encourage\nlending and in turn lead to more economic activity. The jury is out on how\nmuch QE really helped these economies, but the inﬂuence on currencies was\nundeniable.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX170■U.S. Quantitative Easing\nAfter the ﬁnancial crisis, the ﬁrst major central bank to respond with quantitative\neasing was the U.S. Federal Reserve. In November 2008, the central bank launched\na $600 billion bond-buying program. The program was initially effective as the\neconomy improved, prompting the Fed to temporarily halt bond purchases.\nHowever, the economy never gained additional momentum and as such, the central\nbank returned with a second round of QE (dubbed QE2) in November 2010. The\nsize of the program matched the ﬁrst round. Unfortunately, more bond buys were\nneeded, and QE3 was launched in September 2012. Unlike QE1 and QE2, QE3\nwas an open-ended program. The central bank announced plans to purchase $40\nbillion in assets every month, and in December 2012, that amount was increased\nto $85 billion per month. The program lasted for ﬁve years, and purchases were\nﬁnally halted in October 2014. Figure 20.1 shows how each round of quantitative\neasing impacted the EURUSD. As you can see, each round triggered a sharp rise in\nEURUSD and—another way to look at it—weakness in the U.S. dollar. In 2008,\nthe month that QE1 was announced, EURUSD surged 17% from high to low.\nWhen QE2 was announced, the EURUSD began a rally that took the pair up more\nthan 20%. QE3 led to a similar uptrend with gains extended when the program\nwas increased.\n■UK Quantitative Easing\nQuantitative easing was launched by the Bank of England in March 2009. At the\ntime, the BoE pledged to spend 75 billion pounds over a three-month period buying\nUK assets, but the program continue d and between March 2009 and January 2010,\nthe central bank had spent 200 billion pounds. In October 2011, growth started to\nslow more dramatically with the economy facing a double dip recession. In response\npolicymakers voted to increase the QE program by another 75 billion. In February\n2012, the central bank added another 50 billion and the same increase was made in\nJuly 2012, bringing the total program to 375 billion pounds. Figure 20.2 shows how\nGBPUSD responded to each round of QE. What is interesting is that the sterling\nfell sharply in the run up to the March 2009 announcement. It extended lower\nafterward but rebounded in the months that followed. In 2011, 2012, and 2013,\nthe sterling rallied the month that QE was announced. One important thing to\nremember is that the Federal Reserve was also buying bonds and expanding its own\nQE program at the time, so the two offset each other to some degree, limiting the\nreaction in GBPUSD. More importantly, investors interpreted each round of BoE\nQE as positive for the currency because they hoped that the central bank’s efforts\nwould help to turn around the economy.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk171\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.1 EURUSD US Fed QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk172\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.2 GBPUSD UK BoE QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk173\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.3 USDJPY Japan BoJ QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk174\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.4 EURUSD EZ ECB QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX175■Japan Quantitative Easing\nThe phrase quantitative easing was ﬁrst used by the Bank of Japan in 2001. At the time,\nthey did not believe that the program was effective but after the ﬁnancial crisis, they\nsaid they would examine their asset purchase program. In October 2011 the Bank of\nJapan increased the program by 5 trillion yen which was a small sum (approximately\nUSD$66 billion) compared to the staggering amounts that other countries were\npurchasing. Then in April 2013, they announced a bold and aggressive plan to\nbuy 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen a year as part of Prime Minister Abe’s economic\npolicies. This program was later expanded to 80 billion yen a year. Unlike other\ncountries where the effectiveness of QE was debated, Japan’s bond buying program\nplayed a large role in turning around the economy. It also had a signiﬁcant impact\non the currency. In Figure 20.3 we show how the ﬁrst program yielded a very small\nresponse in USDJPY but when the Bank of Japan came out in size, USDJPY reacted\nquickly and aggressively with a move that extended even further when the program\nwas expanded.\n■Eurozone Quantitative Easing\nThe European Central Bank was the last major central bank to roll out quantitative\neasing. They were reluctant to do so for a very long time because structurally the\nEurozone is not set up for quantitative easing. Since there is no euro-bond, some\ncritics felt that it was not in line with the central bank’s mandate. However faced\nwith sluggish growth, stubbornly low inﬂation, and an interest rate already at zero,\nthe ECB had very few options. They publicly discussed the option months before the\nactual decision, giving the market plenty of opportunity to discount the move. In\nJanuary 2015, the ECB announced that they would spend 60 billion euros per month\nbuying private and public bonds. In March 2015, ECB President Draghi unveiled\nan aggressive 1 trillion quantitative easing program. As shown in Figure 20.4, both\nannouncements had a signiﬁcant impact on the currency, but EURUSD stabilized\nafter the second announcement (but only after falling 500 pips) because investors\nhoped that the aggressive program by the central bank would help turn around\nthe economy.\nWhile no additional quantitative easing programs are expected as of mid-2015,\nthe unwinding of these unprecedented measures in the coming years should have\njust as much impact on currencies as the initial announcement itself, providing an\nopportunity for forex traders.",
        "135CHAPTER 14\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: 20-Day\nBreakout Trade\nTrading breakouts can be both a rewarding and frustrating endeavor as breakouts\nhave a tendency to fail. A major reason why this can occur frequently in the\nforeign exchange market is because it is more technically driven than others and as a\nresult, there are many market participants who intentionally look to break pairs out\nin order to ‘‘suck’’ in other nonsuspecting traders. In an effort to ﬁlter out potential\nfalse breakouts, a price action screener should be used to identify breakouts that\nhave a higher probability of success. The rules behind this strategy are speciﬁcally\ndeveloped to take advantage of strong trending markets that make new highs that\nthen proceed to ‘‘fail’’ by taking out a recent low and then reverse again to make\nanother new high. This type of setup tends to have a very high success rate as it\nallows traders to enter strong trending markets after weaker players have been\nﬂushed out, only to have real money players reenter the market and push the pair\nup to new highs.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day high.\n2. Look for the pair to reverse the same day or next to make a two-day low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE1363. Buy the pair if it takes out the 20-day high within three days of making the\ntwo-day low.\n4. Place the initial stop a few pips below the two-day low.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nShorts:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day low.\n2. That day or the next the pair rallies to make a two-day high.\n3. Sell the pair if it trades below the 20-day low within three days of making the\ntwo-day high.\n4. Risk up to a few ticks above the two-day high.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nExamples\nNow take a look at our ﬁrst example in Figure 14.1. The daily chart of GBPUSD\nshows the currency pair making a new 20-day high on February 5. At this point,\nthe currency pair is on our radar, and we watch for a new two-day low to be made\nFIGURE 14.1 GBPUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE137within the next three days. This occurs right on schedule after which we wait for\nthe currency pair to make a new 20-day high, which occurs on February 12. At the\ntime, we buy GBPUSD a few pips above the previous 20-day high of 1.5352. We\nenter at 1.5360. The stop is placed a few pips below the original two-day low of\n1.5197 (or 1.5190). As the currency pair moves in our favor, we look to exit half\nof the position when it moves by the amount that we risked, which is 155 pips or\n1.5507. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or the\ninitial entry price of 1.5352. This rest of the trade is exited 24 hours later.\nFigure 14.2 provides an example of how the strategy can work in the EURUSD\nto the short side. On December 23, the currency pair makes a new 20-day low of\n1.2165. It goes on radar and we start looking for the currency pair to rebound within\nthe next three days. The recovery occurs the following day, and a new two-day\nhigh is made. Then we look for the previous 20-day low to be broken within the\nfollowing three days and that occurs shortly thereafter. At which point we enter\na short EURUSD trade at 1.2155 with a stop at 1.2260, or a few pips above the\ntwo-day high of 1.2254. Our risk on the trade is 105 pips. When the currency pair\ndrops to 1.2050, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. Then we trail the stop using a 2-bar high and end up exiting the\nremainder of the position at 1.1846.\nThe ﬁnal example shown in Figure 14.3 is in AUDUSD. The currency starts by\nmaking a new 20-day low on January 26. It goes on radar and we start looking\nfor the currency pair to rebound within the next three days. The recovery occurs\nFIGURE 14.2 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE138\nFIGURE 14.3 AUDUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nintraday, and a new two-day high is made right on schedule. Then we look for the\nprevious 20-day low to be broken within the following three days it occurs 24 hours\nafter the two-day high is made. At which point we enter a short AUDUSD trade a\nfew pips below the 20-day low at 0.7850 with a stop at 0.8032, or a few pips above\nthe two-day high of 0.8025. Our risk on the trade is 182 pips. When the currency\npair drops to 0.7668, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. The breakeven stop is triggered the very same day that the ﬁrst\ntarget is reached.\n139CHAPTER 15\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Channels\nChannel trading is a less exotic but popular trading technique for currencies. The\nreason why it can work is because currencies rarely spend much time in tight\ntrading ranges and have the tendency to develop strong trends. By reviewing a few\ncharts, traders can see that channels can easily be identiﬁed and occur frequently.\nA common scenario would be channel trading during the Asian session and a\nbreakout in either the London or U.S. session. There are many instances where\neconomic releases are one of the most common triggers for a break of the channel.\nTherefore, it is imperative that traders keep on top of economic releases. If a channel\nhas formed and a big U.S. number (per say) is expected to be released, and the\ncurrency pair is at the top of a channel, the probability of a break is high, so traders\nshould be looking to buy the break out, not fade it.\nChannels are created when we draw a trendline, and then draw a line that is\nparallel to that trendline. Most if not all of the price activity of the currency pair\nshould fall between the two channel lines. We will seek to identify situations where\nthe price is trading within a narrow channel, and then trade in the direction of a\nbreakout from the channel. This strategy can be particularly effective when used\nprior to a fundamental market event such as the release of major economic news, or\nprior to the ‘‘open’’ of a major ﬁnancial market.\nHere are some rules for using this technique to ﬁnd long trades:\n1. First, identify a channel on either an intraday or daily chart. The price should\nbe contained within a narrow range.\n2. Enter long as the price breaks above the upper channel line by 10 pips.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS1403. Place a stop at the lower channel line.\n4. Exit the position when it moves by double the amount risked.\nThe short rules are the reverse.\n■Examples\nLet examine a few examples. The ﬁrst example is a USDCAD 15-minute chart\nshown in Figure 15.1. The total range of the channel is approximately 30 pips with\nthe low being 1.2028 and the high 1.2056. In accordance with our strategy, we\nplace entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at 1.2018 and 1.2066. The\norder to buy gets triggered ﬁrst, and almost immediately we place a stop order\nat the low of the channel or 1.2028, which means we are risking 38 pips on the\ntrade. USDCAD then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of double the range at\n1.2142. More conservative traders could exit half of the position when it moves by\nthe amount risked, or 38 pips, and trail the stop on the remainder of the position.\nThe next example shown in Figure 15.2 is a 15-minute chart of EURGBP. The\ntotal range between the two lines is 12 p ips with the low being 0.7148 and the high\n0.7160. In accordance with our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and\nbelow the channel at 0.7138 and 0.7170. The order to buy gets triggered ﬁrst and\nalmost immediately we place a stop at the low of the channel or 0.7160 for 10-pip\nrisk.

For an uptrend, a perfect order would be a situation\nin which the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) is at a higher price level than\nthe 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 50-day SMA. Meanwhile, the 100-day\nSMA would be below the 50-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA would be below\nthe 100-day SMA. In a downtrend, the opposite is true, where the 200-day SMA is\nat the highest level and the 10-day SMA is at the lowest level. Having the moving\naverages stacked up in sequential order are generally a strong indicator of a trending\nenvironment. Not only does it indicate that the momentum is on the side of trend,\nbut the moving averages also serve as multiple levels of support. To optimize the\nperfect order strategy, traders should also look for ADX to be greater than 20 and\ntrending upward. This represents a strong trend. Entry and exit levels are difﬁcult\nto determine with this strategy, but genera l l ys p e a k i n g ,w ew a n tt os t a yi nt h et r a d e\nfor as long as the perfect order remains in place and exit once the perfect order no\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER144longer holds. Perfect orders do not happen often, and the premise of this strategy is\nto capture the perfect order when it ﬁrst happens.\nThe perfect order seeks to take advantage of a trending environment near the\nbeginning of the trend:\n1. Look for a currency pair with moving averages in perfect order.\n2. Look for ADX pointing upwards, ideally greater than 20.\n3. Buy ﬁve candles after the initial formation of the perfect order (if it still\nholds).\n4. Initial stop is the low on the day of the initial crossover for longs and the high\nfor shorts.\n5. Exit the position when the perfect order no longer holds.\n■Examples\nFigure 16.1 is a daily chart of the EURUSD. In August 2014, the moving averages\nin the EURUSD formed a sequential perfect order. We check and see that ADX is\ngreater than 20, and we look to enter into a short trade ﬁve candles after the initial\nformation at 1.3390. Our initial stop is placed at the August 8 high of 1.3432. The\npair continues to move lower in the days and weeks that follow, and we remain in\nthe trade until the moving averages are no longer in perfect and the 10-day SMA\nmoves above the 20-day SMA, which occurs on October 17 when EURUSD settles\nthe day at 1.2758. The total proﬁt on this trade is 632 pips. We risked 42 pips on\nthe trade.\nThe next example is USDSGD. In Figure 16.2, the perfect order forms on\nNovember 6. We check and see that ADX is greater than 20, and we look to enter\ninto a long trade ﬁve candles after the initial formation at 1.2916. Our stop should\nbe at the November 6 low of 1.2911 but that is below our entry price so we put\nour stop at the 20-day SMA of 1.2822. The pair continues to move higher in the\nmonths that follow, and we remain in the trade until the moving averages are no\nlonger in perfect and the 10-day SMA moves below the 20-day SMA, which occurs\non March 27, when USD/SGD closes the day at 1.3685. The total move on this\ntrade is 770 pips for a risk of 89 pips.\nFigure 16.3 shows a perfect-order formation on a daily chart in USDJPY. The\nperfect order formed in October and when that occurred, we entered the trade\nﬁve days afterward at 116.20. Our stop was placed at 108.75, and we remained in\nthe trade until the 10-day SMA crossed below the 20-day SMA on December 19 at\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk145\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.1 EURUSD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk146\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.2 USDSGD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk147\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.3 USDJPY Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER148119.45. In this example, the proﬁt was 425 pips for a risk of 645 pips, which was\nfar from ideal.\nThe perfect order is a strategy that can be high proﬁt but low probability and\nlow frequency. This means there could be numerous stop outs before a long trend\nemerges. Also, when the currency pair moves more than 250 to 300 pips in proﬁt,\nyou may want to consider taking proﬁt on part of the positions.\n149CHAPTER 17\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nPairing Strong with\nWeak\nOne of the best ways to approach currency trading on a fundamental basis\nis to pair the strongest currency with the weakest. Of course ﬁnding that\npairing is rarely simple because it is not just about which countries are the strongest\nor weakest right now but instead which ones will become strong or weak going\nforward. Finding these currencies can also be challenging because we live in a global\neconomy where the health of one major economy will affect the outlook of another.\nYet buying a weak currency and selling a strong one unknowingly can be a big\nmistake that translates into large losses, so it is extremely important for forex traders\nto learn how to pair strong with weak to maximize returns. After doing so you can\nuse technical analysis to help identify points of entry in the direction of the trend.\nIn 2015, for example, the European Central Bank introduced quantitative easing\n(QE) as a last ditch effort to boost inﬂation and stimulate growth. We know that\nQE lowers interest rates and erodes the value of a currency but selling euros blindly\non March 9, 2015, when the central bank started buying bonds for the very ﬁrst\ntime, yielded only a short-lived decline in the currency. Instead it would have been\nsmarter to look for opportunities to sell the currency against a strong one on rallies.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK150\nFIGURE 17.1 EURGBP Daily Chart—Quantitative Easing\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 17.2 NZDCAD Daily Chart—Oil\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK151One good candidate at the time was the British pound, which was beneﬁting from\neconomic improvements and had a central bank that was moving closer to raising\nrates. Figure 17.1 shows how there was a lot of consolidation in EURGBP near\n74 cents prior to the launch of Eurozone quantitative easing. This level proved to\nbe resistance when the pair rallied in late March. Traders could have sold them,\nassuming that resistance would hold, or waited for the pair to revisit that level in\nApril and May.\nAnother way to pair strong with weak is to follow the direction of commodity\nprices. Oil prices bottomed at $43.46 in early 2015, having traded above $100 a\nbarrel only 8 months earlier and started to turn higher in March. As a major oil\nproducer, Canada would stand to beneﬁt from stabilization in crude prices. At the\ntime U.S. policy makers were talking about raising interest rates, the Australian\ndollar was beneﬁtting from improving domestic conditions, and sterling soared on\npositive data and a victory by the incumbent during the 2015 general election.\nSelling any of these currencies and buying the Canadian dollar would have been a\nrisky endeavor. Instead the best bet at th e time was to sell the New Zealand dollar\nand buy the Canadian dollar or the NZDCAD pair because New Zealand reported\nextremely weak labor data that prompted policy makers to talk about easing. As\nyou can see in Figure 17.2, NZDCAD started to turn lower just as oil prices moved\nhigher in March.\nFIGURE 17.3 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK152The best way to gauge strong versus weak is to monitor economic data surprises.\nWhile the ECB was buying bonds and implementing quantitative easing, Eurozone\ndata started to improve and U.S. data started to weaken. The market had not\nanticipated this shift in dynamic as they had been looking for weak Eurozone data to\nreinforce QE and stronger U.S. data to push the Fed to tighten. This unexpected\nchange drove EURUSD sharply higher, and buying breakouts in April and May as\nshown in Figure 17.3 would have been good bets.\n153CHAPTER 18\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nThe Leveraged\nCarry Trade\nThe leverage carry trade strategy is the quintessential global macro trade that\nhas long been one of the favorite strategies of hedge funds and investment\nbanks. On its most fundamental level, the carry trade strategy involves buying\na high-yielding currency and funding it with the sale of a low-yielding currency.\nAggressive speculators will leave the trade unhedged with the hope that the high\nyielding currency will appreciate in value relative to the lower yielding currency,\nallowing them to earn the interest rate differential on top of the capital appreciation.\nMore conservative investors may choose to hedge the exchange rate component,\nearning only the interest rate differential. Although the differentials tend to be small,\nusually 1 to 3 percent if the position is leveraged 5 to 10 times, the proﬁts from\ninterest rates alone can be substantial. Of course it is important to remember that\nwhile leverage can magnify proﬁts, it can also exacerbate losses. Capital appreciation\ngenerally occurs when a number of traders identify proﬁt opportunities and pile into\nthe same trade, driving up the value of the currency pair.\nIn foreign exchange trading, the carry trade is a popular way to take advantage\nof the notion that money ﬂows in and out of different markets, driven by the law\nof supply and demand: with markets offering higher rates of return on investment\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE154attracting the most capital. Countries are no different—in the world of international\ncapital ﬂows, nations that offer the highest interest rates will generally attract more\ninvestment creating greater demand for their currencies. This helps to fuel the\ncarry trade. The carry trade strategy is simple to master, but like all strategies,\nit contains risk. Carry trades perf ormed extremely well between 2000 and 2007,\nfailed miserably between 2008 and 2009, and recovered between late 2012 into\n2015. The chance of loss can be great if you do not understand how, why, and when\ncarry trades work best.\n■How Do Carry Trades Work?\nTo understand carry trading, it is important to ﬁrst understand that currencies are\nalways traded in pairs, so taking a carry trade involves buying a currency that offers\na high interest rate and simultaneously selling a currency that offers a low interest\nrate. Carry trades are proﬁtable when the exchange rate remains unchanged in\nvalue and investors are able to earn the d ifference in interes t—or spread—between\nthe two currencies, or when it appreciates in value, allowing the investor to earn\nthe spread along with capital appreciation. If the exchange rate falls by more than\nthe spread on the interest rate, it becomes a net loss for the investor.\nLet’s take a look at an example: Assume that the Australian dollar offers an\ninterest rate of 4.75%, while the Swiss franc offers an interest rate of 0.25%. To\nexecute the carry trade, an investor buys the Australian dollar and sells the Swiss\nfranc. In doing so, he or she can earn a proﬁt of 4.50% (2.75% in interest earned\nminus 0.25% in interest paid), as long as the exchange rate between Australian\ndollars and Swiss francs do not change. Figure 18.1 shows exactly how an investor\nwould execute the carry trade.\nLong Short\nBuy AUD\n4.75%Sell CHF\n0.25%Investor\nReceives: 4.75% from long AUD\nposition\nPays: 0.25% through short USD\nfunding position\nProfit: 4.50% in interest rate\nspread, assuming spot rate is \nconstantEnters long AUD/USD trade:\nFIGURE 18.1 Leveraged Carry Trade Example\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE155To summarize : A carry trade involves buying a currency that offers a high interest\nrate while selling a currency that offers a low interest rate.\n■Why Do Carry Trades Work?\nInterest rates are very important: Carry trades work because of the constant\nmovement of capital into and out of different countries in search of the highest yield.\nInterest rates are the main reason why some countries attract more investment\nthan others. There are three reasons why a country can pay a higher interest rate.\nFirst, if a country’s economy is doing well (high growth, high productivity, low\nunemployment, rising incomes, etc.), it will be able to offer those who invest in the\ncountry a higher rate of return. Second, central banks can raise interest rates on fast\ngrowing economies with rising inﬂation. Third, countries with high debt to GDP\nratios, low credit ratings, and/or inherent growth problems may also need to pay a\nhigher interest rate to attract investment.\nInvestors prefer to earn higher interest rates: Investors who are interested in\nmaximizing their proﬁts will naturally look for investments that offer them the\nhighest rate of return. When making a decision to invest in a particular currency, an\ninvestor is more likely to choose one that offers the highest rate of return, or in this\ncase, interest rate. If several investors make this exact same decision, the country\nwill experience an inﬂow of capital from those seeking to earn a high rate of return,\nand the currency should appreciate.\nWhat about countries that are not doing well economically? Countries that have\nlow growth and low productivity will not be able to offer investors a high rate of\nreturn unless they have a very poor credit rating and are forced to offer a higher\nrate to compensate for the risk of holding the country’s bond or currency. With\nmajor economies, however, there will be times where growth is so weak that\ninterest rates are brought to zero, providing investors with no meaningful return.\nThe difference between countries that offer h igh interest rates versus countries that\noffer low interest rates is what makes carry trades possible.\nLet’s take another look at the carry trade example above in more detail.\nImagine an investor in Switzerland who is earning an interest rate of 0.25% per\nyear on her bank deposit in Swiss francs. At the time, a bank in Australia is offering\n4.75% per year on a deposit of Australian dollars. Seeing that interest rates are much\nhigher with the Australian bank, this in vestor would like to ﬁnd a way to earn this\nhigher rate of interest on her money.\nNow imagine that the investor could somehow trade her deposit of Swiss francs\nby paying 0.25% for a deposit of Australian dollars paying 4.75%. What she has\neffectively done is to ‘‘sell’’ her Swiss franc deposit and use those funds to ‘‘buy’’ an\nAustralian dollar deposit. With this transaction, she now owns an Australian dollar\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE156Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.2 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 1\ndeposit that pays her 4.75% in interest per year, 4.50% more than she was earning\nwith her Swiss franc deposit.\nThis investor has essentially just done a carry trade by ‘‘buying’’ an Australian\ndollar deposit, and ‘‘selling’’ a Swiss franc deposit.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows out of\nSwitzerland and into Australia, as investors take their Swiss francs and convert them\ninto Australian dollars. Australia attracts more capital because of the higher rates it\noffers. This inﬂow of capital increases the value of the currency (see Figure 18.2).\nTo summarize : Carry trades are made possible by the differences in interest rates\nbetween countries. B ecause they prefer to ea rn higher interest ra tes, investors will\nlook to buy and hold high interest rate paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Work Best?\nThere will be times when carry trades work better than others. In fact, carry trades\nare the most proﬁtable when there is a very speciﬁc attitude toward risk.\n■How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take?\nThe moods of people in general change over time—sometimes they may feel more\ndaring and willing to take chances; other times they may be more timid and prone to\nconservativeness. Investors, as a group, are no different. Sometimes they are willing\nto make investments that involve a good amount of risk; other times they are more\nfearful of losses and look to invest in safer assets.\nIn ﬁnancial jargon, when investors as a whole are willing to take on risk, we\ncall this low risk aversion, which means they are in risk-seeking mode. Alternatively,\nwhen investors are drawn to more conservative investments and less willing to take\no nr i s k ,w ed e s c r i b et h e ma s risk-averse .\nCarry trades are the most proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion .T h i s\nnotion makes sense when you consider what a carry trade involves. Remember, a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE157carry trade involves buying a currency that pays a high interest rate while selling a\ncurrency that pays a low interest rate. In buying the high interest rate currency, the\ninvestor is taking a risk because it is believed that a country needs to offer a higher\ninterest rate to offset the risk of holding th e currency. Also, while high interest rates\nattract investment, they can also hurt growth by raising the cost of borrowing. This\ncreates uncertainty around whether the economy of the country will continue to\nperform well and be able to pay not just high but even higher interest rates. This\nrisk is something a carry trade investor must be willing to take.\nIf investors as a whole were not willing to take on this risk, then capital would\nnever move from one country to another, and the carry trade opportunity would\nnot exist. Therefore, in order to return, carry trades require that investors as a\ngroup have low risk aversion, or be willing to bear the risk of investing in the higher\ninterest rate currency.\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the most proﬁtable when investors are willing\nto bear the risk of investing in high interest paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Not Work?\nSo far, we have shown that a carry trade will work best when investors have low\nrisk aversion. What happens when investors have high risk aversion ?\nCarry trades are the least proﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion .W h e n\ninvestors have high risk aversion, they are less willing as a group to take chances\nwith their investments. This means they would be less willing to invest in riskier\ncurrencies that offer higher interest rates. Instead, when investors have high risk\naversion they would actually prefer to put their money in ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies\nthat pay lower interest rates. During this time, they may also opt to close or unwind\ntheir carry trades. In doing so, they would be buying the currency with the low\ninterest rate and selling the curre ncy with the high interest rate.\nReturning to our earlier example, let’s assume the investor suddenly feels\nuncomfortable holding the foreign currency, the Australian dollar. Now, instead of\nlooking for the higher interest rate, she is more interested in keeping her investment\nsafe. As a result, she swaps her Australian dollars for more familiar Swiss francs.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows\nout of Australia and into Switzerland as investors take their Australian dollars and\nconvert them into Swiss francs. During this period of risk aversion, Switzerland\nattracts more capital due to the perceived safety of its currency, and the inﬂow of\ncapital increases the value of the Swiss franc (see Figure18.3).\nWhen investors have high risk aversion, they prefer to avoid the riskier high\ninterest rate paying currency and instea d invest in the safer, lower interest rate\npaying currency, which is the opposite of a carry trade.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE158Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.3 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 2\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the least proﬁtable in periods of uncertainty\nwhen investors are unwilling to bear the risk of investing in high interest paying\ncurrencies.\n■The Importance of Risk Aversion\nCarry trades will generally be proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion, and\nunproﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion. So before placing a carry trade\nit is important to understand the risk environment—whether investors as a whole\nhave high or low risk aversion—and when it changes .\nRising risk aversion is generally beneﬁcial for low interest rate paying currencies:\nSometimes the mood of investors will change rapidly, and investors’ willingness\nto make risky trades can change dramatically from one moment to the next.\nOften, these large shifts are caused by signiﬁcant global events. When periods\nof risk aversion occur quickly, the result is generally a large capital inﬂow into\nlow-interest-rate-paying ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies (see Figure 18.2).\nFor example, in the summer of 1998 the Japanese yen appreciated against the\ndollar by more than 20% over the span of two months, due to the Russian debt\ncrisis and LTCM hedge fund bailout. Similarly, just after the September 11 terrorist\nattacks the Swiss franc rose by more than 7% against the dollar over a 10-day period.\nDuring the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, we also saw big gains in the yen and the\nSwiss franc.\nThese sharp movements in currency values often occur when risk aversion quickly\nchanges from low to high. As a result, when risk aversion shifts, a carry trade can\nturn from being proﬁtable to unproﬁtable very quickly.\nRisk Aversion and Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nAs investor risk aversion goes from high to low, carry trades become more proﬁtable\nas detailed in Figure 18.4.\nHow do you know if investors as a whole have high or low risk aversion?\nUnfortunately, it is difﬁcult to measure investor risk aversion with a single number.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE1591 .

Low-interest currencies\ntend to remain weak, used in \nfinancing risky trades(–)( +)\nFIGURE 18.4 Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nOne way to get a broad idea of risk aversion levels is to look at bond yields. The\nwider the spread between the yields of bonds from different countries with similar\ncredit ratings, the higher the investor risk aversion. Bond yields are readily available\non major ﬁnancial websites such as Bloomberg.com and Reuters.com. In addition,\nseveral large banks have developed their own measures of risk aversion that signal\nwhen investors are willing to take risk and when they are not.\nOther Things to Bear in Mind When Considering a Carry Trade\nWhile risk aversion is one of the most important things to consider before making\na carry trade, it is not the only one. The following are some additional issues to be\naware of.\nLow Interest Rate Currency Appreciation\nBy entering into a carry trade, an investor is able to earn a proﬁt from the interest\nrate difference, or spread, between a high interest rate currency and a low interest\nrate currency. However, the carry trade can turn unproﬁtable if for some reason\n(like the risk aversion examples earlier), the low interest rate currency appreciates\nby a signiﬁcant amount.\nAside from rising risk aversion, improving economic conditions within a low\ninterest paying country can also cause its currency to appreciate. An ideal carry trade\nwill involve a low interest currency whose economy is weak and has low expectations\nfor growth. If the economy were to improve, however, the country might then be\nable to offer investors a higher rate of return through increased interest rates. If this\nwere to occur—again, using the previous example, say that Switzerland increased\nthe interest rates it offered—then investors may take advantage of these higher rates\nby investing in Swiss francs. As seen in Figure 18.3, an appreciation of the Swiss franc\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE160would negatively affect the proﬁtability of the Australian dollar–Swiss franc carry\ntrade. (At the very least, higher interest rates in Switzerland would negatively affect\nthe carry trade’s proﬁtability by lowering the interest rate spread.)\nThis same sequence of events may currently be unfolding for the Japanese yen.\nGiven its zero interest rates, the Jap anese yen has for a very long time been an\nideal low interest rate currency to use in carry trades (known as yen carry trades ).\nThis situation however, may be changing. Increased optimism about the Japanese\neconomy has recently led to an increase in the Japanese stock market. Increased\ninvestor demand for Japanese stocks and currency has caused the yen to appreciate,\nand this yen appreciation negatively affects the proﬁtability of carry trades like\nAustralian dollar (high interest rate) versus Japanese yen.\nIf investors continue to buy the yen, the yen carry trade could start to become\nunproﬁtable. This further illustrates the fact that when the low interest rate currency\nin a carry trade (the currency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the\nproﬁtability of the overall carry trade position.\nTrade Balances\nA country’s trade balance (the differen ce between imports and exports) can also\naffect the proﬁtability of a carry trade. We know that when investors have low\nrisk aversion or are risk seeking, capital will ﬂow from the low interest rate paying\ncurrency to the high interest rate paying currency (see Figure 18.2) but this does\nnot always happen.\nOne reason is because countries with large trade surplus can still see their\ncurrencies appreciate in low risk environments because running a trade surplus\nmeans that the country exports more than it imports. This creates naturally demand\nfor the currency.\nThe point of this example is to show that even when investors have low risk\naversion, large trade imbalances can cause a low interest rate currency to appreciate\n(as in Figure 18.3). And when the low interest rate currency in a carry trade (the\ncurrency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the proﬁtability of the carry\ntrade.\nTime Horizon\nIn general, a carry trade is a long-term strategy. Before entering into a carry trade,\nan investor should be willing to commit to a time-horizon of at least six months. This\ncommitment helps to make sure that the trade will not be affected by the ‘‘noise’’\nof shorter-term currency price movements.\nTo summarize : Carry trade investors should be aware of factors such as currency\nappreciation, trade balances, and time horizon before placing a trade. Any or all of\nthese factors can cause a seemingly proﬁtable carry trade to become unproﬁtable.\n161CHAPTER 19\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nMacro Event Driven\nTrade\nShort-term traders are generally focused only on the economic release of the\nweek and how it will impact their day trading activities. This works well for\nmany traders, but it is also important not to lose sight of the big macro events\nthat may be brewing in the economy or the world for that matter. Large-scale\nmacroeconomic events will move markets and will move them in very big ways.\nTheir impact goes beyond a simple one- or two-day price change because depending\non their size and scope, these occurrences have the potential to reshape the\nfundamental perception toward a currency for months or even years at a time.\nEvents such as wars, political uncertainly, natural disasters, and major international\nmeetings or monetary policy changes are so potent due to their irregularity that they\ncan have widespread psychological and physical impacts on the currency market.\nWith these events come both currencies that appreciate vastly and currencies that\ndepreciate just as dramatically. Therefore, keeping on top of global developments,\nunderstanding the underlying direction of market sentiment before and after these\nevents occur and anticipating them could be very proﬁtable, or at least can help\nprevent signiﬁcant losses.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE162■Know When Big Events Occur: Here Is a List\nof a Few Important Ones\n■Signiﬁcant G7 ﬁnance ministers meetings\n■Presidential elections\n■Important summits\n■Major Central Bank meetings\n■Potential changes to currency regimes\n■Possible debt defaults by large countries\n■Possible wars as a result of rising geopolitical tensions\n■Federal Reserve chairman’s semiannual testimony on economy\nThe best way to highlight the signiﬁcance of these events is look at a few notable\nmacroeconomic examples from the past two decades.\n2014 Ukraine–Russia Crisis\nThe 2014 Ukraine–Russia crisis was one of the biggest geopolitical events of the\npast decade. The crisis began in 2013 but didn’t really hit its peak until March\n2014 when Russia signed a bill to absorb Crimea. Leading up to the announcement,\nthe uncertainty put signiﬁcant pressure on the EURUSD in January 2014 with the\ncurrency pair dropping sharply on March 18, 2014, the day that Russia declared that\nCrimea was now ofﬁcially apart of their country. This led to a few more weeks of\ndownward pressure for the EURUSD as shown in Figure 19.1 as investors awaited\nthe world’s response. Many nations declared their support for Ukraine and war was\nfeared, but eventually Russia was only hit with sanctions, and a few months later,\nthe Ukraine crisis moved to the back burner.\nEuropean Sovereign Debt Crisis (2009–2013)\nThe European Sovereign Debt Crisis started in 2009 and lasted into 2013 with the bulk\nof the damage being done by February 2012. It was a multiyear debt crisis that was\nsparked by the inability of many member nations to meet their debt obligations after\nthe global ﬁnancial crisis. Their banking sectors and economies suffered signiﬁcant\nlosses, and persistently negative growth prospects made it impossible for countries\nsuch as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus to repay or reﬁnance their government\ndebt.

The country of Spain did not require a bailout\nbut in 2012, a number of banks required additional funding. The crisis posed caused\nsigniﬁcant volatility for the euro. Figure 19.2 shows two long periods of EURUSD\nweakness that were caused by bailouts, downgrades, and other negative headlines.\nGlobal Financial Crisis (2007–2009), Subprime\nOne of the most important macroeconomic events of the twenty-ﬁrst century was\nthe 2007 to 2009 subprime/global ﬁnancial crisis. It was triggered by a sharp slide\nin house prices, default on mortgages, and blowup of subprime mortgage backed\nsecurities and collateralized debt obligations. This, in turn, caused massive losses for\nbanks and ﬁnancial institutions, leading the failure of major ﬁrms such as Lehman\nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns. The impact on the ﬁnancial market and\nthe economy was staggering, with many countries falling into recession. During this\nperiod, the stock market lost more than 50% of its value with the S&P 500, falling\nfrom a high of 1,565 in October 2007 to a low of 676 in March 2009. As shown in\nFigure 19.3, USDJPY dropped from a high of 116.47 in October 2007 to a low of\n87.13 in January 2009. This was only the beginning of a multiyear decline for the\ncurrency pair. EURUSD had a delayed reaction, rallying strongly between October\n2007 and April 2008 as money ﬂowed out of the U.S. economy, and then falling\nsharply between July 2008 and October 2008 as the risk aversion and crisis spread\nto Europe.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE165\nFIGURE 19.3 USDJPY Global Financial Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nPolitical Uncertainty: 2004 U.S. Presidential Election\nAnother example of major events impacting the currency market is the 2004 U.S.\npresidential elections. In general, political instability causes perceived weakness\nin currencies. The hotly contested presidential election in November of 2004,\ncombined with the differences in the candidates’ stance on the growing budget\ndeﬁcit, resulted in overall dollar bearishness. The sentiment was exacerbated even\nfurther, given the lack of international support for the incumbent President (Bush)\ndue to the administration’s decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein. As a result, in\nthe three weeks leading up to the election, the euro rose 600 pips against the U.S.\ndollar. This can be seen in Figure 19.4. With a Bush victory becoming increasingly\nclear and later conﬁrmed, the dollar sold off against the majors as the market looked\nahead to what would probably end up being the maintenance of status quo. On the\nday following the election, the EURUSD rose another 200 pips and then continued\nto rise an additional 700 pips before peaking out six weeks later. This entire move\ntook place over the course of two months, which may seem like an eternity for\nmany, but this macroeconomic event really shaped the markets and for those who\nwere following it, big proﬁts could have been made. However, this is important\neven for short-term traders because given that the market was bearish dollars in\ngeneral leading up to the U.S. presidential election, a more prudent trade would be\nto look for opportunities to buy the EURUSD on dips rather than trying sell rallies\nand look for tops.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE166\nPost Election -\nAnother 700\nPip Rally \n600 Pip Rally\nPre Election\n2004 Election\nNight\nFIGURE 19.4 EURUSD Election Trade\nSource: eSignal\nG7 Meeting Dubai September 2003\nThe G7 ﬁnance ministers meeting on September 22, 2003, was a very important\nturning point for the markets. The dollar collapsed signiﬁcantly following the meeting\nat which the G7 ﬁnance ministers wanted to see ‘‘more ﬂexibility in exchange rates.’’\nDespite the rather tame nature of these words, the market interpreted this line to be\na major shift in policy. The last time changes to this degree had been made was back in\n2000. Taking a step back, the countries that constitute the G7 are the United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, and France. Collectively, these\ncountries account for two-thirds of the world’s total economic output. Not all G7\nmeetings are important. The only time the market really hones in on the G7 ﬁnance\nministers meeting is when they expect big changes to be made to the statement. In\n2000, the market paid particular attention to the upcoming meeting because there\nwas strong intervention in the EURUSD the day before the meeting. The meeting\nin September 2003 was also important because the U.S. trade deﬁcit was ballooning\nand becoming a huge issue. The EURUSD bore the brunt of the dollar depreciation\nwhile Japan and China were intervening aggressively in their currencies. As a result,\nit was widely expected that the G7 ﬁnance ministers as a whole would issue a\nstatement that was highly critical of Japan and China’s intervention policies. Leading\nup to the meeting, the U.S. dollar had alre ady begun to sell off as indicated by the\nchart. At the time of the announcement, the EURUSD shot up 150 pips. Though\nthis initial move was not ve ry substantial, between Se ptember 2003 and February\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE167\n6% Rally\n14% Rally\nSept 22, 2003\nG7 Meeting\nFIGURE 19.5 EURUSD G7 Meeting\nSource: eSignal\n2004 (which was the next G7 meeting), the dollar fell 8% on a trade-weighted\nbasis, 9% against the British pound, 11% against the euro, 7% against the yen,\nand 1.5% against the Canadian dollar. To put the percentages into perspective, a\nmove of 11% is equivalent to approximately 1100 pips. Therefore, the longer-term\nimpact is much more signiﬁcant than the immediate impact as the event itself has the\nsigniﬁcance to change the overall sentiment in the market. Figure 19.5 is a weekly\nchart of the EURUSD that illustrates how the currency pair performed following\nthe September 22, 2003 G7 meeting.\nU.S. War Against Iraq\nGeopolitical risks such as wars can also have a pronounced impact on the currency\nmarket. Figure 19.6 shows that bet ween December 2002 and February 2003, the\ndollar depreciated 9% against the Swiss franc (USDCHF) in the months leading up\nto war. The dollar sold off because the war itself was incredibly unpopular among\nthe international community. The Swiss franc was one of the primary beneﬁciaries\ndue to the country’s political neutrality an d safe-haven status. Between February\nand March, traders began to believe that the inevitable war would turn into a quick\nand decisive U.S. victory, so they began to unwind the war trade. This eventually\nled to a 3% rally in USDCHF as investors exited their short dollar positions.\nEach of these events caused large-scale movements in the currency market. Such\nevents are clearly important to follow for all types of traders. Keeping abreast of\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE168\nFIGURE 19.6 USDCHF Iraq War\nSource: eSignal\nbroad macroeconomic events can help traders make smarter decisions and prevent\nthem from fading large factors that may be brewing in the background. Most of\nthese events are talked about, debated, and anticipated many months in advance by\neconomists, currency analysts, and the international community in general.\n169CHAPTER 20\nQuantitative Easing\nand Its Impact on\nForex\nQuantitative easing is such an important topic that it deserves its own chapter.\nAfter the global ﬁnancial crisis many countries fell into recession, and in\nresponse central banks around the world lowered interest rates to record lows.\nWhen rates could not fall any lower, they had to resort to unprecedented measures,\nthe most powerful of which was quantit ative easing (QE). Between 2007 and 2015,\nthe Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and\nthe Swedish National Bank all resorted to QE, and their decision had a signiﬁcant\nimpact on their currencies on both a short- and long-term basis.\nThe goal of quantitative easing is to keep yields low and to ﬂood the market\nwith liquidity. To do so, a central bank would create money by buying ﬁnancial\nassets such as government bonds from banks using electronic cash. This basically\n‘‘creates new money.’’ It also keeps yields low because bond prices have an inverse\nrelationship with yields and in giving banks money, the hope is that it will encourage\nlending and in turn lead to more economic activity. The jury is out on how\nmuch QE really helped these economies, but the inﬂuence on currencies was\nundeniable.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX170■U.S. Quantitative Easing\nAfter the ﬁnancial crisis, the ﬁrst major central bank to respond with quantitative\neasing was the U.S. Federal Reserve. In November 2008, the central bank launched\na $600 billion bond-buying program. The program was initially effective as the\neconomy improved, prompting the Fed to temporarily halt bond purchases.\nHowever, the economy never gained additional momentum and as such, the central\nbank returned with a second round of QE (dubbed QE2) in November 2010. The\nsize of the program matched the ﬁrst round. Unfortunately, more bond buys were\nneeded, and QE3 was launched in September 2012. Unlike QE1 and QE2, QE3\nwas an open-ended program. The central bank announced plans to purchase $40\nbillion in assets every month, and in December 2012, that amount was increased\nto $85 billion per month. The program lasted for ﬁve years, and purchases were\nﬁnally halted in October 2014. Figure 20.1 shows how each round of quantitative\neasing impacted the EURUSD. As you can see, each round triggered a sharp rise in\nEURUSD and—another way to look at it—weakness in the U.S. dollar. In 2008,\nthe month that QE1 was announced, EURUSD surged 17% from high to low.\nWhen QE2 was announced, the EURUSD began a rally that took the pair up more\nthan 20%. QE3 led to a similar uptrend with gains extended when the program\nwas increased.\n■UK Quantitative Easing\nQuantitative easing was launched by the Bank of England in March 2009. At the\ntime, the BoE pledged to spend 75 billion pounds over a three-month period buying\nUK assets, but the program continue d and between March 2009 and January 2010,\nthe central bank had spent 200 billion pounds. In October 2011, growth started to\nslow more dramatically with the economy facing a double dip recession. In response\npolicymakers voted to increase the QE program by another 75 billion. In February\n2012, the central bank added another 50 billion and the same increase was made in\nJuly 2012, bringing the total program to 375 billion pounds. Figure 20.2 shows how\nGBPUSD responded to each round of QE. What is interesting is that the sterling\nfell sharply in the run up to the March 2009 announcement. It extended lower\nafterward but rebounded in the months that followed. In 2011, 2012, and 2013,\nthe sterling rallied the month that QE was announced. One important thing to\nremember is that the Federal Reserve was also buying bonds and expanding its own\nQE program at the time, so the two offset each other to some degree, limiting the\nreaction in GBPUSD. More importantly, investors interpreted each round of BoE\nQE as positive for the currency because they hoped that the central bank’s efforts\nwould help to turn around the economy.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk171\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.1 EURUSD US Fed QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk172\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.2 GBPUSD UK BoE QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk173\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.3 USDJPY Japan BoJ QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk174\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.4 EURUSD EZ ECB QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX175■Japan Quantitative Easing\nThe phrase quantitative easing was ﬁrst used by the Bank of Japan in 2001. At the time,\nthey did not believe that the program was effective but after the ﬁnancial crisis, they\nsaid they would examine their asset purchase program. In October 2011 the Bank of\nJapan increased the program by 5 trillion yen which was a small sum (approximately\nUSD$66 billion) compared to the staggering amounts that other countries were\npurchasing. Then in April 2013, they announced a bold and aggressive plan to\nbuy 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen a year as part of Prime Minister Abe’s economic\npolicies. This program was later expanded to 80 billion yen a year. Unlike other\ncountries where the effectiveness of QE was debated, Japan’s bond buying program\nplayed a large role in turning around the economy. It also had a signiﬁcant impact\non the currency. In Figure 20.3 we show how the ﬁrst program yielded a very small\nresponse in USDJPY but when the Bank of Japan came out in size, USDJPY reacted\nquickly and aggressively with a move that extended even further when the program\nwas expanded.\n■Eurozone Quantitative Easing\nThe European Central Bank was the last major central bank to roll out quantitative\neasing. They were reluctant to do so for a very long time because structurally the\nEurozone is not set up for quantitative easing. Since there is no euro-bond, some\ncritics felt that it was not in line with the central bank’s mandate. However faced\nwith sluggish growth, stubbornly low inﬂation, and an interest rate already at zero,\nthe ECB had very few options. They publicly discussed the option months before the\nactual decision, giving the market plenty of opportunity to discount the move. In\nJanuary 2015, the ECB announced that they would spend 60 billion euros per month\nbuying private and public bonds. In March 2015, ECB President Draghi unveiled\nan aggressive 1 trillion quantitative easing program. As shown in Figure 20.4, both\nannouncements had a signiﬁcant impact on the currency, but EURUSD stabilized\nafter the second announcement (but only after falling 500 pips) because investors\nhoped that the aggressive program by the central bank would help turn around\nthe economy.\nWhile no additional quantitative easing programs are expected as of mid-2015,\nthe unwinding of these unprecedented measures in the coming years should have\njust as much impact on currencies as the initial announcement itself, providing an\nopportunity for forex traders."

        "135CHAPTER 14\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: 20-Day\nBreakout Trade\nTrading breakouts can be both a rewarding and frustrating endeavor as breakouts\nhave a tendency to fail. A major reason why this can occur frequently in the\nforeign exchange market is because it is more technically driven than others and as a\nresult, there are many market participants who intentionally look to break pairs out\nin order to ‘‘suck’’ in other nonsuspecting traders. In an effort to ﬁlter out potential\nfalse breakouts, a price action screener should be used to identify breakouts that\nhave a higher probability of success. The rules behind this strategy are speciﬁcally\ndeveloped to take advantage of strong trending markets that make new highs that\nthen proceed to ‘‘fail’’ by taking out a recent low and then reverse again to make\nanother new high. This type of setup tends to have a very high success rate as it\nallows traders to enter strong trending markets after weaker players have been\nﬂushed out, only to have real money players reenter the market and push the pair\nup to new highs.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day high.\n2. Look for the pair to reverse the same day or next to make a two-day low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE1363. Buy the pair if it takes out the 20-day high within three days of making the\ntwo-day low.\n4. Place the initial stop a few pips below the two-day low.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nShorts:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day low.\n2. That day or the next the pair rallies to make a two-day high.\n3. Sell the pair if it trades below the 20-day low within three days of making the\ntwo-day high.\n4. Risk up to a few ticks above the two-day high.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nExamples\nNow take a look at our ﬁrst example in Figure 14.1. The daily chart of GBPUSD\nshows the currency pair making a new 20-day high on February 5. At this point,\nthe currency pair is on our radar, and we watch for a new two-day low to be made\nFIGURE 14.1 GBPUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE137within the next three days. This occurs right on schedule after which we wait for\nthe currency pair to make a new 20-day high, which occurs on February 12. At the\ntime, we buy GBPUSD a few pips above the previous 20-day high of 1.5352. We\nenter at 1.5360. The stop is placed a few pips below the original two-day low of\n1.5197 (or 1.5190). As the currency pair moves in our favor, we look to exit half\nof the position when it moves by the amount that we risked, which is 155 pips or\n1.5507. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or the\ninitial entry price of 1.5352. This rest of the trade is exited 24 hours later.\nFigure 14.2 provides an example of how the strategy can work in the EURUSD\nto the short side. On December 23, the currency pair makes a new 20-day low of\n1.2165. It goes on radar and we start looking for the currency pair to rebound within\nthe next three days. The recovery occurs the following day, and a new two-day\nhigh is made. Then we look for the previous 20-day low to be broken within the\nfollowing three days and that occurs shortly thereafter. At which point we enter\na short EURUSD trade at 1.2155 with a stop at 1.2260, or a few pips above the\ntwo-day high of 1.2254. Our risk on the trade is 105 pips. When the currency pair\ndrops to 1.2050, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. Then we trail the stop using a 2-bar high and end up exiting the\nremainder of the position at 1.1846.\nThe ﬁnal example shown in Figure 14.3 is in AUDUSD. The currency starts by\nmaking a new 20-day low on January 26. It goes on radar and we start looking\nfor the currency pair to rebound within the next three days. The recovery occurs\nFIGURE 14.2 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE138\nFIGURE 14.3 AUDUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nintraday, and a new two-day high is made right on schedule. Then we look for the\nprevious 20-day low to be broken within the following three days it occurs 24 hours\nafter the two-day high is made. At which point we enter a short AUDUSD trade a\nfew pips below the 20-day low at 0.7850 with a stop at 0.8032, or a few pips above\nthe two-day high of 0.8025. Our risk on the trade is 182 pips. When the currency\npair drops to 0.7668, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. The breakeven stop is triggered the very same day that the ﬁrst\ntarget is reached.\n139CHAPTER 15\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Channels\nChannel trading is a less exotic but popular trading technique for currencies. The\nreason why it can work is because currencies rarely spend much time in tight\ntrading ranges and have the tendency to develop strong trends. By reviewing a few\ncharts, traders can see that channels can easily be identiﬁed and occur frequently.\nA common scenario would be channel trading during the Asian session and a\nbreakout in either the London or U.S. session. There are many instances where\neconomic releases are one of the most common triggers for a break of the channel.\nTherefore, it is imperative that traders keep on top of economic releases. If a channel\nhas formed and a big U.S. number (per say) is expected to be released, and the\ncurrency pair is at the top of a channel, the probability of a break is high, so traders\nshould be looking to buy the break out, not fade it.\nChannels are created when we draw a trendline, and then draw a line that is\nparallel to that trendline. Most if not all of the price activity of the currency pair\nshould fall between the two channel lines. We will seek to identify situations where\nthe price is trading within a narrow channel, and then trade in the direction of a\nbreakout from the channel. This strategy can be particularly effective when used\nprior to a fundamental market event such as the release of major economic news, or\nprior to the ‘‘open’’ of a major ﬁnancial market.\nHere are some rules for using this technique to ﬁnd long trades:\n1. First, identify a channel on either an intraday or daily chart. The price should\nbe contained within a narrow range.\n2. Enter long as the price breaks above the upper channel line by 10 pips.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS1403. Place a stop at the lower channel line.\n4. Exit the position when it moves by double the amount risked.\nThe short rules are the reverse.\n■Examples\nLet examine a few examples. The ﬁrst example is a USDCAD 15-minute chart\nshown in Figure 15.1. The total range of the channel is approximately 30 pips with\nthe low being 1.2028 and the high 1.2056. In accordance with our strategy, we\nplace entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at 1.2018 and 1.2066. The\norder to buy gets triggered ﬁrst, and almost immediately we place a stop order\nat the low of the channel or 1.2028, which means we are risking 38 pips on the\ntrade. USDCAD then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of double the range at\n1.2142. More conservative traders could exit half of the position when it moves by\nthe amount risked, or 38 pips, and trail the stop on the remainder of the position.\nThe next example shown in Figure 15.2 is a 15-minute chart of EURGBP. The\ntotal range between the two lines is 12 p ips with the low being 0.7148 and the high\n0.7160. In accordance with our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and\nbelow the channel at 0.7138 and 0.7170. The order to buy gets triggered ﬁrst and\nalmost immediately we place a stop at the low of the channel or 0.7160 for 10-pip\nrisk. EURGBP then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of 20 pips or double\nthe amount risked.\nFIGURE 15.1 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS141\nFIGURE 15.2 EURGBP 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 15.3 EURUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFigure 15.3 is a 15-minute chart of the EURUSD. The total range during this\nfour-hour period is 18 pips with a high of 1.1206 and a low of 1.1188. In accordance\nwith our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at\n1.1216 and 1.1178. The order to sell gets triggered ﬁrst and almost immediately,\nwe place a stop order at the channel high of 1.1206 for a risk of 28 pips. The\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS142EURUSD then proceeds to sell off signiﬁcantly but only makes it to a low of 1.1132\nbefore stopping us out a few days later. We chose to show this example because it\nexplains why the more conservative approach of exiting half of the position when it\nmoves by the amount risk is more desirable, even though it has worse risk reward.\nA move of 58 pips is sizable on an intraday basis and may be difﬁcult to achieve.\nWhenever the risk is greater than 20 pips, it may be more prudent to exit half and\ntrail the stop.\n143CHAPTER 16\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Perfect\nOrder\nAperfect order in moving averages is deﬁned as a set of moving averages that\nis in sequential order. For an uptrend, a perfect order would be a situation\nin which the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) is at a higher price level than\nthe 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 50-day SMA. Meanwhile, the 100-day\nSMA would be below the 50-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA would be below\nthe 100-day SMA. In a downtrend, the opposite is true, where the 200-day SMA is\nat the highest level and the 10-day SMA is at the lowest level. Having the moving\naverages stacked up in sequential order are generally a strong indicator of a trending\nenvironment. Not only does it indicate that the momentum is on the side of trend,\nbut the moving averages also serve as multiple levels of support. To optimize the\nperfect order strategy, traders should also look for ADX to be greater than 20 and\ntrending upward. This represents a strong trend. Entry and exit levels are difﬁcult\nto determine with this strategy, but genera l l ys p e a k i n g ,w ew a n tt os t a yi nt h et r a d e\nfor as long as the perfect order remains in place and exit once the perfect order no\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER144longer holds. Perfect orders do not happen often, and the premise of this strategy is\nto capture the perfect order when it ﬁrst happens.\nThe perfect order seeks to take advantage of a trending environment near the\nbeginning of the trend:\n1. Look for a currency pair with moving averages in perfect order.\n2. Look for ADX pointing upwards, ideally greater than 20.\n3.

Exit the position when the perfect order no longer holds.\n■Examples\nFigure 16.1 is a daily chart of the EURUSD. In August 2014, the moving averages\nin the EURUSD formed a sequential perfect order. We check and see that ADX is\ngreater than 20, and we look to enter into a short trade ﬁve candles after the initial\nformation at 1.3390. Our initial stop is placed at the August 8 high of 1.3432. The\npair continues to move lower in the days and weeks that follow, and we remain in\nthe trade until the moving averages are no longer in perfect and the 10-day SMA\nmoves above the 20-day SMA, which occurs on October 17 when EURUSD settles\nthe day at 1.2758. The total proﬁt on this trade is 632 pips. We risked 42 pips on\nthe trade.\nThe next example is USDSGD. In Figure 16.2, the perfect order forms on\nNovember 6. We check and see that ADX is greater than 20, and we look to enter\ninto a long trade ﬁve candles after the initial formation at 1.2916. Our stop should\nbe at the November 6 low of 1.2911 but that is below our entry price so we put\nour stop at the 20-day SMA of 1.2822. The pair continues to move higher in the\nmonths that follow, and we remain in the trade until the moving averages are no\nlonger in perfect and the 10-day SMA moves below the 20-day SMA, which occurs\non March 27, when USD/SGD closes the day at 1.3685.

This means there could be numerous stop outs before a long trend\nemerges. Also, when the currency pair moves more than 250 to 300 pips in proﬁt,\nyou may want to consider taking proﬁt on part of the positions.\n149CHAPTER 17\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nPairing Strong with\nWeak\nOne of the best ways to approach currency trading on a fundamental basis\nis to pair the strongest currency with the weakest. Of course ﬁnding that\npairing is rarely simple because it is not just about which countries are the strongest\nor weakest right now but instead which ones will become strong or weak going\nforward. Finding these currencies can also be challenging because we live in a global\neconomy where the health of one major economy will affect the outlook of another.\nYet buying a weak currency and selling a strong one unknowingly can be a big\nmistake that translates into large losses, so it is extremely important for forex traders\nto learn how to pair strong with weak to maximize returns. After doing so you can\nuse technical analysis to help identify points of entry in the direction of the trend.\nIn 2015, for example, the European Central Bank introduced quantitative easing\n(QE) as a last ditch effort to boost inﬂation and stimulate growth. We know that\nQE lowers interest rates and erodes the value of a currency but selling euros blindly\non March 9, 2015, when the central bank started buying bonds for the very ﬁrst\ntime, yielded only a short-lived decline in the currency. Instead it would have been\nsmarter to look for opportunities to sell the currency against a strong one on rallies.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK150\nFIGURE 17.1 EURGBP Daily Chart—Quantitative Easing\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 17.2 NZDCAD Daily Chart—Oil\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK151One good candidate at the time was the British pound, which was beneﬁting from\neconomic improvements and had a central bank that was moving closer to raising\nrates. Figure 17.1 shows how there was a lot of consolidation in EURGBP near\n74 cents prior to the launch of Eurozone quantitative easing. This level proved to\nbe resistance when the pair rallied in late March. Traders could have sold them,\nassuming that resistance would hold, or waited for the pair to revisit that level in\nApril and May.\nAnother way to pair strong with weak is to follow the direction of commodity\nprices. Oil prices bottomed at $43.46 in early 2015, having traded above $100 a\nbarrel only 8 months earlier and started to turn higher in March. As a major oil\nproducer, Canada would stand to beneﬁt from stabilization in crude prices. At the\ntime U.S. policy makers were talking about raising interest rates, the Australian\ndollar was beneﬁtting from improving domestic conditions, and sterling soared on\npositive data and a victory by the incumbent during the 2015 general election.\nSelling any of these currencies and buying the Canadian dollar would have been a\nrisky endeavor. Instead the best bet at th e time was to sell the New Zealand dollar\nand buy the Canadian dollar or the NZDCAD pair because New Zealand reported\nextremely weak labor data that prompted policy makers to talk about easing. As\nyou can see in Figure 17.2, NZDCAD started to turn lower just as oil prices moved\nhigher in March.\nFIGURE 17.3 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK152The best way to gauge strong versus weak is to monitor economic data surprises.\nWhile the ECB was buying bonds and implementing quantitative easing, Eurozone\ndata started to improve and U.S. data started to weaken. The market had not\nanticipated this shift in dynamic as they had been looking for weak Eurozone data to\nreinforce QE and stronger U.S. data to push the Fed to tighten. This unexpected\nchange drove EURUSD sharply higher, and buying breakouts in April and May as\nshown in Figure 17.3 would have been good bets.\n153CHAPTER 18\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nThe Leveraged\nCarry Trade\nThe leverage carry trade strategy is the quintessential global macro trade that\nhas long been one of the favorite strategies of hedge funds and investment\nbanks. On its most fundamental level, the carry trade strategy involves buying\na high-yielding currency and funding it with the sale of a low-yielding currency.\nAggressive speculators will leave the trade unhedged with the hope that the high\nyielding currency will appreciate in value relative to the lower yielding currency,\nallowing them to earn the interest rate differential on top of the capital appreciation.\nMore conservative investors may choose to hedge the exchange rate component,\nearning only the interest rate differential. Although the differentials tend to be small,\nusually 1 to 3 percent if the position is leveraged 5 to 10 times, the proﬁts from\ninterest rates alone can be substantial. Of course it is important to remember that\nwhile leverage can magnify proﬁts, it can also exacerbate losses. Capital appreciation\ngenerally occurs when a number of traders identify proﬁt opportunities and pile into\nthe same trade, driving up the value of the currency pair.\nIn foreign exchange trading, the carry trade is a popular way to take advantage\nof the notion that money ﬂows in and out of different markets, driven by the law\nof supply and demand: with markets offering higher rates of return on investment\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE154attracting the most capital. Countries are no different—in the world of international\ncapital ﬂows, nations that offer the highest interest rates will generally attract more\ninvestment creating greater demand for their currencies. This helps to fuel the\ncarry trade. The carry trade strategy is simple to master, but like all strategies,\nit contains risk. Carry trades perf ormed extremely well between 2000 and 2007,\nfailed miserably between 2008 and 2009, and recovered between late 2012 into\n2015. The chance of loss can be great if you do not understand how, why, and when\ncarry trades work best.\n■How Do Carry Trades Work?\nTo understand carry trading, it is important to ﬁrst understand that currencies are\nalways traded in pairs, so taking a carry trade involves buying a currency that offers\na high interest rate and simultaneously selling a currency that offers a low interest\nrate. Carry trades are proﬁtable when the exchange rate remains unchanged in\nvalue and investors are able to earn the d ifference in interes t—or spread—between\nthe two currencies, or when it appreciates in value, allowing the investor to earn\nthe spread along with capital appreciation. If the exchange rate falls by more than\nthe spread on the interest rate, it becomes a net loss for the investor.\nLet’s take a look at an example: Assume that the Australian dollar offers an\ninterest rate of 4.75%, while the Swiss franc offers an interest rate of 0.25%. To\nexecute the carry trade, an investor buys the Australian dollar and sells the Swiss\nfranc. In doing so, he or she can earn a proﬁt of 4.50% (2.75% in interest earned\nminus 0.25% in interest paid), as long as the exchange rate between Australian\ndollars and Swiss francs do not change. Figure 18.1 shows exactly how an investor\nwould execute the carry trade.\nLong Short\nBuy AUD\n4.75%Sell CHF\n0.25%Investor\nReceives: 4.75% from long AUD\nposition\nPays: 0.25% through short USD\nfunding position\nProfit: 4.50% in interest rate\nspread, assuming spot rate is \nconstantEnters long AUD/USD trade:\nFIGURE 18.1 Leveraged Carry Trade Example\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE155To summarize : A carry trade involves buying a currency that offers a high interest\nrate while selling a currency that offers a low interest rate.\n■Why Do Carry Trades Work?\nInterest rates are very important: Carry trades work because of the constant\nmovement of capital into and out of different countries in search of the highest yield.\nInterest rates are the main reason why some countries attract more investment\nthan others. There are three reasons why a country can pay a higher interest rate.\nFirst, if a country’s economy is doing well (high growth, high productivity, low\nunemployment, rising incomes, etc.), it will be able to offer those who invest in the\ncountry a higher rate of return. Second, central banks can raise interest rates on fast\ngrowing economies with rising inﬂation. Third, countries with high debt to GDP\nratios, low credit ratings, and/or inherent growth problems may also need to pay a\nhigher interest rate to attract investment.\nInvestors prefer to earn higher interest rates: Investors who are interested in\nmaximizing their proﬁts will naturally look for investments that offer them the\nhighest rate of return. When making a decision to invest in a particular currency, an\ninvestor is more likely to choose one that offers the highest rate of return, or in this\ncase, interest rate. If several investors make this exact same decision, the country\nwill experience an inﬂow of capital from those seeking to earn a high rate of return,\nand the currency should appreciate.\nWhat about countries that are not doing well economically? Countries that have\nlow growth and low productivity will not be able to offer investors a high rate of\nreturn unless they have a very poor credit rating and are forced to offer a higher\nrate to compensate for the risk of holding the country’s bond or currency. With\nmajor economies, however, there will be times where growth is so weak that\ninterest rates are brought to zero, providing investors with no meaningful return.\nThe difference between countries that offer h igh interest rates versus countries that\noffer low interest rates is what makes carry trades possible.\nLet’s take another look at the carry trade example above in more detail.\nImagine an investor in Switzerland who is earning an interest rate of 0.25% per\nyear on her bank deposit in Swiss francs. At the time, a bank in Australia is offering\n4.75% per year on a deposit of Australian dollars. Seeing that interest rates are much\nhigher with the Australian bank, this in vestor would like to ﬁnd a way to earn this\nhigher rate of interest on her money.\nNow imagine that the investor could somehow trade her deposit of Swiss francs\nby paying 0.25% for a deposit of Australian dollars paying 4.75%. What she has\neffectively done is to ‘‘sell’’ her Swiss franc deposit and use those funds to ‘‘buy’’ an\nAustralian dollar deposit. With this transaction, she now owns an Australian dollar\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE156Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.2 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 1\ndeposit that pays her 4.75% in interest per year, 4.50% more than she was earning\nwith her Swiss franc deposit.\nThis investor has essentially just done a carry trade by ‘‘buying’’ an Australian\ndollar deposit, and ‘‘selling’’ a Swiss franc deposit.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows out of\nSwitzerland and into Australia, as investors take their Swiss francs and convert them\ninto Australian dollars. Australia attracts more capital because of the higher rates it\noffers. This inﬂow of capital increases the value of the currency (see Figure 18.2).\nTo summarize : Carry trades are made possible by the differences in interest rates\nbetween countries. B ecause they prefer to ea rn higher interest ra tes, investors will\nlook to buy and hold high interest rate paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Work Best?\nThere will be times when carry trades work better than others. In fact, carry trades\nare the most proﬁtable when there is a very speciﬁc attitude toward risk.\n■How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take?\nThe moods of people in general change over time—sometimes they may feel more\ndaring and willing to take chances; other times they may be more timid and prone to\nconservativeness. Investors, as a group, are no different. Sometimes they are willing\nto make investments that involve a good amount of risk; other times they are more\nfearful of losses and look to invest in safer assets.\nIn ﬁnancial jargon, when investors as a whole are willing to take on risk, we\ncall this low risk aversion, which means they are in risk-seeking mode. Alternatively,\nwhen investors are drawn to more conservative investments and less willing to take\no nr i s k ,w ed e s c r i b et h e ma s risk-averse .\nCarry trades are the most proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion .T h i s\nnotion makes sense when you consider what a carry trade involves. Remember, a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE157carry trade involves buying a currency that pays a high interest rate while selling a\ncurrency that pays a low interest rate. In buying the high interest rate currency, the\ninvestor is taking a risk because it is believed that a country needs to offer a higher\ninterest rate to offset the risk of holding th e currency. Also, while high interest rates\nattract investment, they can also hurt growth by raising the cost of borrowing. This\ncreates uncertainty around whether the economy of the country will continue to\nperform well and be able to pay not just high but even higher interest rates. This\nrisk is something a carry trade investor must be willing to take.\nIf investors as a whole were not willing to take on this risk, then capital would\nnever move from one country to another, and the carry trade opportunity would\nnot exist. Therefore, in order to return, carry trades require that investors as a\ngroup have low risk aversion, or be willing to bear the risk of investing in the higher\ninterest rate currency.\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the most proﬁtable when investors are willing\nto bear the risk of investing in high interest paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Not Work?\nSo far, we have shown that a carry trade will work best when investors have low\nrisk aversion. What happens when investors have high risk aversion ?\nCarry trades are the least proﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion .W h e n\ninvestors have high risk aversion, they are less willing as a group to take chances\nwith their investments. This means they would be less willing to invest in riskier\ncurrencies that offer higher interest rates. Instead, when investors have high risk\naversion they would actually prefer to put their money in ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies\nthat pay lower interest rates. During this time, they may also opt to close or unwind\ntheir carry trades. In doing so, they would be buying the currency with the low\ninterest rate and selling the curre ncy with the high interest rate.\nReturning to our earlier example, let’s assume the investor suddenly feels\nuncomfortable holding the foreign currency, the Australian dollar. Now, instead of\nlooking for the higher interest rate, she is more interested in keeping her investment\nsafe. As a result, she swaps her Australian dollars for more familiar Swiss francs.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows\nout of Australia and into Switzerland as investors take their Australian dollars and\nconvert them into Swiss francs. During this period of risk aversion, Switzerland\nattracts more capital due to the perceived safety of its currency, and the inﬂow of\ncapital increases the value of the Swiss franc (see Figure18.3).\nWhen investors have high risk aversion, they prefer to avoid the riskier high\ninterest rate paying currency and instea d invest in the safer, lower interest rate\npaying currency, which is the opposite of a carry trade.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE158Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.3 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 2\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the least proﬁtable in periods of uncertainty\nwhen investors are unwilling to bear the risk of investing in high interest paying\ncurrencies.\n■The Importance of Risk Aversion\nCarry trades will generally be proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion, and\nunproﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion. So before placing a carry trade\nit is important to understand the risk environment—whether investors as a whole\nhave high or low risk aversion—and when it changes .\nRising risk aversion is generally beneﬁcial for low interest rate paying currencies:\nSometimes the mood of investors will change rapidly, and investors’ willingness\nto make risky trades can change dramatically from one moment to the next.\nOften, these large shifts are caused by signiﬁcant global events. When periods\nof risk aversion occur quickly, the result is generally a large capital inﬂow into\nlow-interest-rate-paying ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies (see Figure 18.2).\nFor example, in the summer of 1998 the Japanese yen appreciated against the\ndollar by more than 20% over the span of two months, due to the Russian debt\ncrisis and LTCM hedge fund bailout. Similarly, just after the September 11 terrorist\nattacks the Swiss franc rose by more than 7% against the dollar over a 10-day period.\nDuring the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, we also saw big gains in the yen and the\nSwiss franc.\nThese sharp movements in currency values often occur when risk aversion quickly\nchanges from low to high. As a result, when risk aversion shifts, a carry trade can\nturn from being proﬁtable to unproﬁtable very quickly.\nRisk Aversion and Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nAs investor risk aversion goes from high to low, carry trades become more proﬁtable\nas detailed in Figure 18.4.\nHow do you know if investors as a whole have high or low risk aversion?\nUnfortunately, it is difﬁcult to measure investor risk aversion with a single number.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE1591 .

Low-interest currencies\ntend to remain weak, used in \nfinancing risky trades(–)( +)\nFIGURE 18.4 Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nOne way to get a broad idea of risk aversion levels is to look at bond yields. The\nwider the spread between the yields of bonds from different countries with similar\ncredit ratings, the higher the investor risk aversion. Bond yields are readily available\non major ﬁnancial websites such as Bloomberg.com and Reuters.com. In addition,\nseveral large banks have developed their own measures of risk aversion that signal\nwhen investors are willing to take risk and when they are not.\nOther Things to Bear in Mind When Considering a Carry Trade\nWhile risk aversion is one of the most important things to consider before making\na carry trade, it is not the only one. The following are some additional issues to be\naware of.\nLow Interest Rate Currency Appreciation\nBy entering into a carry trade, an investor is able to earn a proﬁt from the interest\nrate difference, or spread, between a high interest rate currency and a low interest\nrate currency. However, the carry trade can turn unproﬁtable if for some reason\n(like the risk aversion examples earlier), the low interest rate currency appreciates\nby a signiﬁcant amount.\nAside from rising risk aversion, improving economic conditions within a low\ninterest paying country can also cause its currency to appreciate. An ideal carry trade\nwill involve a low interest currency whose economy is weak and has low expectations\nfor growth. If the economy were to improve, however, the country might then be\nable to offer investors a higher rate of return through increased interest rates. If this\nwere to occur—again, using the previous example, say that Switzerland increased\nthe interest rates it offered—then investors may take advantage of these higher rates\nby investing in Swiss francs. As seen in Figure 18.3, an appreciation of the Swiss franc\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE160would negatively affect the proﬁtability of the Australian dollar–Swiss franc carry\ntrade. (At the very least, higher interest rates in Switzerland would negatively affect\nthe carry trade’s proﬁtability by lowering the interest rate spread.)\nThis same sequence of events may currently be unfolding for the Japanese yen.\nGiven its zero interest rates, the Jap anese yen has for a very long time been an\nideal low interest rate currency to use in carry trades (known as yen carry trades ).\nThis situation however, may be changing. Increased optimism about the Japanese\neconomy has recently led to an increase in the Japanese stock market. Increased\ninvestor demand for Japanese stocks and currency has caused the yen to appreciate,\nand this yen appreciation negatively affects the proﬁtability of carry trades like\nAustralian dollar (high interest rate) versus Japanese yen.\nIf investors continue to buy the yen, the yen carry trade could start to become\nunproﬁtable. This further illustrates the fact that when the low interest rate currency\nin a carry trade (the currency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the\nproﬁtability of the overall carry trade position.\nTrade Balances\nA country’s trade balance (the differen ce between imports and exports) can also\naffect the proﬁtability of a carry trade. We know that when investors have low\nrisk aversion or are risk seeking, capital will ﬂow from the low interest rate paying\ncurrency to the high interest rate paying currency (see Figure 18.2) but this does\nnot always happen.\nOne reason is because countries with large trade surplus can still see their\ncurrencies appreciate in low risk environments because running a trade surplus\nmeans that the country exports more than it imports. This creates naturally demand\nfor the currency.\nThe point of this example is to show that even when investors have low risk\naversion, large trade imbalances can cause a low interest rate currency to appreciate\n(as in Figure 18.3). And when the low interest rate currency in a carry trade (the\ncurrency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the proﬁtability of the carry\ntrade.\nTime Horizon\nIn general, a carry trade is a long-term strategy. Before entering into a carry trade,\nan investor should be willing to commit to a time-horizon of at least six months. This\ncommitment helps to make sure that the trade will not be affected by the ‘‘noise’’\nof shorter-term currency price movements.\nTo summarize : Carry trade investors should be aware of factors such as currency\nappreciation, trade balances, and time horizon before placing a trade. Any or all of\nthese factors can cause a seemingly proﬁtable carry trade to become unproﬁtable.\n161CHAPTER 19\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nMacro Event Driven\nTrade\nShort-term traders are generally focused only on the economic release of the\nweek and how it will impact their day trading activities. This works well for\nmany traders, but it is also important not to lose sight of the big macro events\nthat may be brewing in the economy or the world for that matter. Large-scale\nmacroeconomic events will move markets and will move them in very big ways.\nTheir impact goes beyond a simple one- or two-day price change because depending\non their size and scope, these occurrences have the potential to reshape the\nfundamental perception toward a currency for months or even years at a time.\nEvents such as wars, political uncertainly, natural disasters, and major international\nmeetings or monetary policy changes are so potent due to their irregularity that they\ncan have widespread psychological and physical impacts on the currency market.\nWith these events come both currencies that appreciate vastly and currencies that\ndepreciate just as dramatically. Therefore, keeping on top of global developments,\nunderstanding the underlying direction of market sentiment before and after these\nevents occur and anticipating them could be very proﬁtable, or at least can help\nprevent signiﬁcant losses.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE162■Know When Big Events Occur: Here Is a List\nof a Few Important Ones\n■Signiﬁcant G7 ﬁnance ministers meetings\n■Presidential elections\n■Important summits\n■Major Central Bank meetings\n■Potential changes to currency regimes\n■Possible debt defaults by large countries\n■Possible wars as a result of rising geopolitical tensions\n■Federal Reserve chairman’s semiannual testimony on economy\nThe best way to highlight the signiﬁcance of these events is look at a few notable\nmacroeconomic examples from the past two decades.\n2014 Ukraine–Russia Crisis\nThe 2014 Ukraine–Russia crisis was one of the biggest geopolitical events of the\npast decade. The crisis began in 2013 but didn’t really hit its peak until March\n2014 when Russia signed a bill to absorb Crimea. Leading up to the announcement,\nthe uncertainty put signiﬁcant pressure on the EURUSD in January 2014 with the\ncurrency pair dropping sharply on March 18, 2014, the day that Russia declared that\nCrimea was now ofﬁcially apart of their country. This led to a few more weeks of\ndownward pressure for the EURUSD as shown in Figure 19.1 as investors awaited\nthe world’s response. Many nations declared their support for Ukraine and war was\nfeared, but eventually Russia was only hit with sanctions, and a few months later,\nthe Ukraine crisis moved to the back burner.\nEuropean Sovereign Debt Crisis (2009–2013)\nThe European Sovereign Debt Crisis started in 2009 and lasted into 2013 with the bulk\nof the damage being done by February 2012. It was a multiyear debt crisis that was\nsparked by the inability of many member nations to meet their debt obligations after\nthe global ﬁnancial crisis. Their banking sectors and economies suffered signiﬁcant\nlosses, and persistently negative growth prospects made it impossible for countries\nsuch as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus to repay or reﬁnance their government\ndebt. Between 2010 and 2012, all of these na tions required bailouts or some form\nof support from the Troika, composed of the ECB, IMF and European Commission.\nWhile the problems were concentrated in smaller Eurozone nations, there was fear\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE163\nFIGURE 19.1 EURUSD Ukraine Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE164\nFIGURE 19.2 EURUSD Sovereign Debt Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nof contagion for the major economies. The country of Spain did not require a bailout\nbut in 2012, a number of banks required additional funding. The crisis posed caused\nsigniﬁcant volatility for the euro. Figure 19.2 shows two long periods of EURUSD\nweakness that were caused by bailouts, downgrades, and other negative headlines.\nGlobal Financial Crisis (2007–2009), Subprime\nOne of the most important macroeconomic events of the twenty-ﬁrst century was\nthe 2007 to 2009 subprime/global ﬁnancial crisis. It was triggered by a sharp slide\nin house prices, default on mortgages, and blowup of subprime mortgage backed\nsecurities and collateralized debt obligations. This, in turn, caused massive losses for\nbanks and ﬁnancial institutions, leading the failure of major ﬁrms such as Lehman\nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns. The impact on the ﬁnancial market and\nthe economy was staggering, with many countries falling into recession. During this\nperiod, the stock market lost more than 50% of its value with the S&P 500, falling\nfrom a high of 1,565 in October 2007 to a low of 676 in March 2009. As shown in\nFigure 19.3, USDJPY dropped from a high of 116.47 in October 2007 to a low of\n87.13 in January 2009. This was only the beginning of a multiyear decline for the\ncurrency pair. EURUSD had a delayed reaction, rallying strongly between October\n2007 and April 2008 as money ﬂowed out of the U.S. economy, and then falling\nsharply between July 2008 and October 2008 as the risk aversion and crisis spread\nto Europe.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE165\nFIGURE 19.3 USDJPY Global Financial Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nPolitical Uncertainty: 2004 U.S. Presidential Election\nAnother example of major events impacting the currency market is the 2004 U.S.\npresidential elections. In general, political instability causes perceived weakness\nin currencies. The hotly contested presidential election in November of 2004,\ncombined with the differences in the candidates’ stance on the growing budget\ndeﬁcit, resulted in overall dollar bearishness. The sentiment was exacerbated even\nfurther, given the lack of international support for the incumbent President (Bush)\ndue to the administration’s decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein. As a result, in\nthe three weeks leading up to the election, the euro rose 600 pips against the U.S.\ndollar. This can be seen in Figure 19.4. With a Bush victory becoming increasingly\nclear and later conﬁrmed, the dollar sold off against the majors as the market looked\nahead to what would probably end up being the maintenance of status quo. On the\nday following the election, the EURUSD rose another 200 pips and then continued\nto rise an additional 700 pips before peaking out six weeks later. This entire move\ntook place over the course of two months, which may seem like an eternity for\nmany, but this macroeconomic event really shaped the markets and for those who\nwere following it, big proﬁts could have been made. However, this is important\neven for short-term traders because given that the market was bearish dollars in\ngeneral leading up to the U.S. presidential election, a more prudent trade would be\nto look for opportunities to buy the EURUSD on dips rather than trying sell rallies\nand look for tops.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE166\nPost Election -\nAnother 700\nPip Rally \n600 Pip Rally\nPre Election\n2004 Election\nNight\nFIGURE 19.4 EURUSD Election Trade\nSource: eSignal\nG7 Meeting Dubai September 2003\nThe G7 ﬁnance ministers meeting on September 22, 2003, was a very important\nturning point for the markets. The dollar collapsed signiﬁcantly following the meeting\nat which the G7 ﬁnance ministers wanted to see ‘‘more ﬂexibility in exchange rates.’’\nDespite the rather tame nature of these words, the market interpreted this line to be\na major shift in policy. The last time changes to this degree had been made was back in\n2000. Taking a step back, the countries that constitute the G7 are the United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, and France. Collectively, these\ncountries account for two-thirds of the world’s total economic output. Not all G7\nmeetings are important. The only time the market really hones in on the G7 ﬁnance\nministers meeting is when they expect big changes to be made to the statement. In\n2000, the market paid particular attention to the upcoming meeting because there\nwas strong intervention in the EURUSD the day before the meeting. The meeting\nin September 2003 was also important because the U.S. trade deﬁcit was ballooning\nand becoming a huge issue. The EURUSD bore the brunt of the dollar depreciation\nwhile Japan and China were intervening aggressively in their currencies. As a result,\nit was widely expected that the G7 ﬁnance ministers as a whole would issue a\nstatement that was highly critical of Japan and China’s intervention policies. Leading\nup to the meeting, the U.S. dollar had alre ady begun to sell off as indicated by the\nchart. At the time of the announcement, the EURUSD shot up 150 pips. Though\nthis initial move was not ve ry substantial, between Se ptember 2003 and February\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE167\n6% Rally\n14% Rally\nSept 22, 2003\nG7 Meeting\nFIGURE 19.5 EURUSD G7 Meeting\nSource: eSignal\n2004 (which was the next G7 meeting), the dollar fell 8% on a trade-weighted\nbasis, 9% against the British pound, 11% against the euro, 7% against the yen,\nand 1.5% against the Canadian dollar. To put the percentages into perspective, a\nmove of 11% is equivalent to approximately 1100 pips. Therefore, the longer-term\nimpact is much more signiﬁcant than the immediate impact as the event itself has the\nsigniﬁcance to change the overall sentiment in the market. Figure 19.5 is a weekly\nchart of the EURUSD that illustrates how the currency pair performed following\nthe September 22, 2003 G7 meeting.\nU.S. War Against Iraq\nGeopolitical risks such as wars can also have a pronounced impact on the currency\nmarket. Figure 19.6 shows that bet ween December 2002 and February 2003, the\ndollar depreciated 9% against the Swiss franc (USDCHF) in the months leading up\nto war. The dollar sold off because the war itself was incredibly unpopular among\nthe international community. The Swiss franc was one of the primary beneﬁciaries\ndue to the country’s political neutrality an d safe-haven status. Between February\nand March, traders began to believe that the inevitable war would turn into a quick\nand decisive U.S. victory, so they began to unwind the war trade. This eventually\nled to a 3% rally in USDCHF as investors exited their short dollar positions.\nEach of these events caused large-scale movements in the currency market. Such\nevents are clearly important to follow for all types of traders. Keeping abreast of\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE168\nFIGURE 19.6 USDCHF Iraq War\nSource: eSignal\nbroad macroeconomic events can help traders make smarter decisions and prevent\nthem from fading large factors that may be brewing in the background. Most of\nthese events are talked about, debated, and anticipated many months in advance by\neconomists, currency analysts, and the international community in general.\n169CHAPTER 20\nQuantitative Easing\nand Its Impact on\nForex\nQuantitative easing is such an important topic that it deserves its own chapter.\nAfter the global ﬁnancial crisis many countries fell into recession, and in\nresponse central banks around the world lowered interest rates to record lows.\nWhen rates could not fall any lower, they had to resort to unprecedented measures,\nthe most powerful of which was quantit ative easing (QE). Between 2007 and 2015,\nthe Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and\nthe Swedish National Bank all resorted to QE, and their decision had a signiﬁcant\nimpact on their currencies on both a short- and long-term basis.\nThe goal of quantitative easing is to keep yields low and to ﬂood the market\nwith liquidity. To do so, a central bank would create money by buying ﬁnancial\nassets such as government bonds from banks using electronic cash. This basically\n‘‘creates new money.’’ It also keeps yields low because bond prices have an inverse\nrelationship with yields and in giving banks money, the hope is that it will encourage\nlending and in turn lead to more economic activity. The jury is out on how\nmuch QE really helped these economies, but the inﬂuence on currencies was\nundeniable.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX170■U.S. Quantitative Easing\nAfter the ﬁnancial crisis, the ﬁrst major central bank to respond with quantitative\neasing was the U.S. Federal Reserve. In November 2008, the central bank launched\na $600 billion bond-buying program. The program was initially effective as the\neconomy improved, prompting the Fed to temporarily halt bond purchases.\nHowever, the economy never gained additional momentum and as such, the central\nbank returned with a second round of QE (dubbed QE2) in November 2010. The\nsize of the program matched the ﬁrst round. Unfortunately, more bond buys were\nneeded, and QE3 was launched in September 2012. Unlike QE1 and QE2, QE3\nwas an open-ended program. The central bank announced plans to purchase $40\nbillion in assets every month, and in December 2012, that amount was increased\nto $85 billion per month. The program lasted for ﬁve years, and purchases were\nﬁnally halted in October 2014. Figure 20.1 shows how each round of quantitative\neasing impacted the EURUSD. As you can see, each round triggered a sharp rise in\nEURUSD and—another way to look at it—weakness in the U.S. dollar. In 2008,\nthe month that QE1 was announced, EURUSD surged 17% from high to low.\nWhen QE2 was announced, the EURUSD began a rally that took the pair up more\nthan 20%. QE3 led to a similar uptrend with gains extended when the program\nwas increased.\n■UK Quantitative Easing\nQuantitative easing was launched by the Bank of England in March 2009. At the\ntime, the BoE pledged to spend 75 billion pounds over a three-month period buying\nUK assets, but the program continue d and between March 2009 and January 2010,\nthe central bank had spent 200 billion pounds. In October 2011, growth started to\nslow more dramatically with the economy facing a double dip recession. In response\npolicymakers voted to increase the QE program by another 75 billion. In February\n2012, the central bank added another 50 billion and the same increase was made in\nJuly 2012, bringing the total program to 375 billion pounds. Figure 20.2 shows how\nGBPUSD responded to each round of QE. What is interesting is that the sterling\nfell sharply in the run up to the March 2009 announcement. It extended lower\nafterward but rebounded in the months that followed. In 2011, 2012, and 2013,\nthe sterling rallied the month that QE was announced. One important thing to\nremember is that the Federal Reserve was also buying bonds and expanding its own\nQE program at the time, so the two offset each other to some degree, limiting the\nreaction in GBPUSD. More importantly, investors interpreted each round of BoE\nQE as positive for the currency because they hoped that the central bank’s efforts\nwould help to turn around the economy.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk171\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.1 EURUSD US Fed QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk172\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.2 GBPUSD UK BoE QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk173\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.3 USDJPY Japan BoJ QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk174\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.4 EURUSD EZ ECB QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX175■Japan Quantitative Easing\nThe phrase quantitative easing was ﬁrst used by the Bank of Japan in 2001. At the time,\nthey did not believe that the program was effective but after the ﬁnancial crisis, they\nsaid they would examine their asset purchase program. In October 2011 the Bank of\nJapan increased the program by 5 trillion yen which was a small sum (approximately\nUSD$66 billion) compared to the staggering amounts that other countries were\npurchasing. Then in April 2013, they announced a bold and aggressive plan to\nbuy 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen a year as part of Prime Minister Abe’s economic\npolicies. This program was later expanded to 80 billion yen a year. Unlike other\ncountries where the effectiveness of QE was debated, Japan’s bond buying program\nplayed a large role in turning around the economy. It also had a signiﬁcant impact\non the currency. In Figure 20.3 we show how the ﬁrst program yielded a very small\nresponse in USDJPY but when the Bank of Japan came out in size, USDJPY reacted\nquickly and aggressively with a move that extended even further when the program\nwas expanded.\n■Eurozone Quantitative Easing\nThe European Central Bank was the last major central bank to roll out quantitative\neasing. They were reluctant to do so for a very long time because structurally the\nEurozone is not set up for quantitative easing. Since there is no euro-bond, some\ncritics felt that it was not in line with the central bank’s mandate. However faced\nwith sluggish growth, stubbornly low inﬂation, and an interest rate already at zero,\nthe ECB had very few options. They publicly discussed the option months before the\nactual decision, giving the market plenty of opportunity to discount the move. In\nJanuary 2015, the ECB announced that they would spend 60 billion euros per month\nbuying private and public bonds. In March 2015, ECB President Draghi unveiled\nan aggressive 1 trillion quantitative easing program. As shown in Figure 20.4, both\nannouncements had a signiﬁcant impact on the currency, but EURUSD stabilized\nafter the second announcement (but only after falling 500 pips) because investors\nhoped that the aggressive program by the central bank would help turn around\nthe economy.\nWhile no additional quantitative easing programs are expected as of mid-2015,\nthe unwinding of these unprecedented measures in the coming years should have\njust as much impact on currencies as the initial announcement itself, providing an\nopportunity for forex traders.",
        "135CHAPTER 14\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: 20-Day\nBreakout Trade\nTrading breakouts can be both a rewarding and frustrating endeavor as breakouts\nhave a tendency to fail. A major reason why this can occur frequently in the\nforeign exchange market is because it is more technically driven than others and as a\nresult, there are many market participants who intentionally look to break pairs out\nin order to ‘‘suck’’ in other nonsuspecting traders. In an effort to ﬁlter out potential\nfalse breakouts, a price action screener should be used to identify breakouts that\nhave a higher probability of success. The rules behind this strategy are speciﬁcally\ndeveloped to take advantage of strong trending markets that make new highs that\nthen proceed to ‘‘fail’’ by taking out a recent low and then reverse again to make\nanother new high. This type of setup tends to have a very high success rate as it\nallows traders to enter strong trending markets after weaker players have been\nﬂushed out, only to have real money players reenter the market and push the pair\nup to new highs.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day high.\n2. Look for the pair to reverse the same day or next to make a two-day low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE1363. Buy the pair if it takes out the 20-day high within three days of making the\ntwo-day low.\n4. Place the initial stop a few pips below the two-day low.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nShorts:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day low.\n2. That day or the next the pair rallies to make a two-day high.\n3. Sell the pair if it trades below the 20-day low within three days of making the\ntwo-day high.\n4. Risk up to a few ticks above the two-day high.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nExamples\nNow take a look at our ﬁrst example in Figure 14.1. The daily chart of GBPUSD\nshows the currency pair making a new 20-day high on February 5. At this point,\nthe currency pair is on our radar, and we watch for a new two-day low to be made\nFIGURE 14.1 GBPUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE137within the next three days. This occurs right on schedule after which we wait for\nthe currency pair to make a new 20-day high, which occurs on February 12. At the\ntime, we buy GBPUSD a few pips above the previous 20-day high of 1.5352. We\nenter at 1.5360. The stop is placed a few pips below the original two-day low of\n1.5197 (or 1.5190). As the currency pair moves in our favor, we look to exit half\nof the position when it moves by the amount that we risked, which is 155 pips or\n1.5507. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or the\ninitial entry price of 1.5352. This rest of the trade is exited 24 hours later.\nFigure 14.2 provides an example of how the strategy can work in the EURUSD\nto the short side. On December 23, the currency pair makes a new 20-day low of\n1.2165. It goes on radar and we start looking for the currency pair to rebound within\nthe next three days. The recovery occurs the following day, and a new two-day\nhigh is made. Then we look for the previous 20-day low to be broken within the\nfollowing three days and that occurs shortly thereafter. At which point we enter\na short EURUSD trade at 1.2155 with a stop at 1.2260, or a few pips above the\ntwo-day high of 1.2254. Our risk on the trade is 105 pips. When the currency pair\ndrops to 1.2050, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. Then we trail the stop using a 2-bar high and end up exiting the\nremainder of the position at 1.1846.\nThe ﬁnal example shown in Figure 14.3 is in AUDUSD. The currency starts by\nmaking a new 20-day low on January 26. It goes on radar and we start looking\nfor the currency pair to rebound within the next three days. The recovery occurs\nFIGURE 14.2 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE138\nFIGURE 14.3 AUDUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nintraday, and a new two-day high is made right on schedule. Then we look for the\nprevious 20-day low to be broken within the following three days it occurs 24 hours\nafter the two-day high is made. At which point we enter a short AUDUSD trade a\nfew pips below the 20-day low at 0.7850 with a stop at 0.8032, or a few pips above\nthe two-day high of 0.8025. Our risk on the trade is 182 pips. When the currency\npair drops to 0.7668, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. The breakeven stop is triggered the very same day that the ﬁrst\ntarget is reached.\n139CHAPTER 15\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Channels\nChannel trading is a less exotic but popular trading technique for currencies. The\nreason why it can work is because currencies rarely spend much time in tight\ntrading ranges and have the tendency to develop strong trends. By reviewing a few\ncharts, traders can see that channels can easily be identiﬁed and occur frequently.\nA common scenario would be channel trading during the Asian session and a\nbreakout in either the London or U.S. session. There are many instances where\neconomic releases are one of the most common triggers for a break of the channel.\nTherefore, it is imperative that traders keep on top of economic releases. If a channel\nhas formed and a big U.S. number (per say) is expected to be released, and the\ncurrency pair is at the top of a channel, the probability of a break is high, so traders\nshould be looking to buy the break out, not fade it.\nChannels are created when we draw a trendline, and then draw a line that is\nparallel to that trendline. Most if not all of the price activity of the currency pair\nshould fall between the two channel lines. We will seek to identify situations where\nthe price is trading within a narrow channel, and then trade in the direction of a\nbreakout from the channel. This strategy can be particularly effective when used\nprior to a fundamental market event such as the release of major economic news, or\nprior to the ‘‘open’’ of a major ﬁnancial market.\nHere are some rules for using this technique to ﬁnd long trades:\n1. First, identify a channel on either an intraday or daily chart. The price should\nbe contained within a narrow range.\n2. Enter long as the price breaks above the upper channel line by 10 pips.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS1403. Place a stop at the lower channel line.\n4. Exit the position when it moves by double the amount risked.\nThe short rules are the reverse.\n■Examples\nLet examine a few examples. The ﬁrst example is a USDCAD 15-minute chart\nshown in Figure 15.1. The total range of the channel is approximately 30 pips with\nthe low being 1.2028 and the high 1.2056. In accordance with our strategy, we\nplace entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at 1.2018 and 1.2066. The\norder to buy gets triggered ﬁrst, and almost immediately we place a stop order\nat the low of the channel or 1.2028, which means we are risking 38 pips on the\ntrade. USDCAD then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of double the range at\n1.2142. More conservative traders could exit half of the position when it moves by\nthe amount risked, or 38 pips, and trail the stop on the remainder of the position.\nThe next example shown in Figure 15.2 is a 15-minute chart of EURGBP. The\ntotal range between the two lines is 12 p ips with the low being 0.7148 and the high\n0.7160. In accordance with our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and\nbelow the channel at 0.7138 and 0.7170. The order to buy gets triggered ﬁrst and\nalmost immediately we place a stop at the low of the channel or 0.7160 for 10-pip\nrisk. EURGBP then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of 20 pips or double\nthe amount risked.\nFIGURE 15.1 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS141\nFIGURE 15.2 EURGBP 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 15.3 EURUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFigure 15.3 is a 15-minute chart of the EURUSD. The total range during this\nfour-hour period is 18 pips with a high of 1.1206 and a low of 1.1188. In accordance\nwith our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at\n1.1216 and 1.1178. The order to sell gets triggered ﬁrst and almost immediately,\nwe place a stop order at the channel high of 1.1206 for a risk of 28 pips. The\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS142EURUSD then proceeds to sell off signiﬁcantly but only makes it to a low of 1.1132\nbefore stopping us out a few days later. We chose to show this example because it\nexplains why the more conservative approach of exiting half of the position when it\nmoves by the amount risk is more desirable, even though it has worse risk reward.\nA move of 58 pips is sizable on an intraday basis and may be difﬁcult to achieve.\nWhenever the risk is greater than 20 pips, it may be more prudent to exit half and\ntrail the stop.\n143CHAPTER 16\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Perfect\nOrder\nAperfect order in moving averages is deﬁned as a set of moving averages that\nis in sequential order. For an uptrend, a perfect order would be a situation\nin which the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) is at a higher price level than\nthe 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 50-day SMA. Meanwhile, the 100-day\nSMA would be below the 50-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA would be below\nthe 100-day SMA. In a downtrend, the opposite is true, where the 200-day SMA is\nat the highest level and the 10-day SMA is at the lowest level. Having the moving\naverages stacked up in sequential order are generally a strong indicator of a trending\nenvironment. Not only does it indicate that the momentum is on the side of trend,\nbut the moving averages also serve as multiple levels of support. To optimize the\nperfect order strategy, traders should also look for ADX to be greater than 20 and\ntrending upward. This represents a strong trend. Entry and exit levels are difﬁcult\nto determine with this strategy, but genera l l ys p e a k i n g ,w ew a n tt os t a yi nt h et r a d e\nfor as long as the perfect order remains in place and exit once the perfect order no\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER144longer holds. Perfect orders do not happen often, and the premise of this strategy is\nto capture the perfect order when it ﬁrst happens.\nThe perfect order seeks to take advantage of a trending environment near the\nbeginning of the trend:\n1. Look for a currency pair with moving averages in perfect order.\n2. Look for ADX pointing upwards, ideally greater than 20.\n3. Buy ﬁve candles after the initial formation of the perfect order (if it still\nholds).\n4. Initial stop is the low on the day of the initial crossover for longs and the high\nfor shorts.\n5. Exit the position when the perfect order no longer holds.\n■Examples\nFigure 16.1 is a daily chart of the EURUSD. In August 2014, the moving averages\nin the EURUSD formed a sequential perfect order. We check and see that ADX is\ngreater than 20, and we look to enter into a short trade ﬁve candles after the initial\nformation at 1.3390. Our initial stop is placed at the August 8 high of 1.3432. The\npair continues to move lower in the days and weeks that follow, and we remain in\nthe trade until the moving averages are no longer in perfect and the 10-day SMA\nmoves above the 20-day SMA, which occurs on October 17 when EURUSD settles\nthe day at 1.2758. The total proﬁt on this trade is 632 pips. We risked 42 pips on\nthe trade.\nThe next example is USDSGD. In Figure 16.2, the perfect order forms on\nNovember 6. We check and see that ADX is greater than 20, and we look to enter\ninto a long trade ﬁve candles after the initial formation at 1.2916. Our stop should\nbe at the November 6 low of 1.2911 but that is below our entry price so we put\nour stop at the 20-day SMA of 1.2822. The pair continues to move higher in the\nmonths that follow, and we remain in the trade until the moving averages are no\nlonger in perfect and the 10-day SMA moves below the 20-day SMA, which occurs\non March 27, when USD/SGD closes the day at 1.3685. The total move on this\ntrade is 770 pips for a risk of 89 pips.\nFigure 16.3 shows a perfect-order formation on a daily chart in USDJPY. The\nperfect order formed in October and when that occurred, we entered the trade\nﬁve days afterward at 116.20. Our stop was placed at 108.75, and we remained in\nthe trade until the 10-day SMA crossed below the 20-day SMA on December 19 at\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk145\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.1 EURUSD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk146\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.2 USDSGD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk147\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.3 USDJPY Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER148119.45. In this example, the proﬁt was 425 pips for a risk of 645 pips, which was\nfar from ideal.\nThe perfect order is a strategy that can be high proﬁt but low probability and\nlow frequency. This means there could be numerous stop outs before a long trend\nemerges. Also, when the currency pair moves more than 250 to 300 pips in proﬁt,\nyou may want to consider taking proﬁt on part of the positions.\n149CHAPTER 17\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nPairing Strong with\nWeak\nOne of the best ways to approach currency trading on a fundamental basis\nis to pair the strongest currency with the weakest. Of course ﬁnding that\npairing is rarely simple because it is not just about which countries are the strongest\nor weakest right now but instead which ones will become strong or weak going\nforward. Finding these currencies can also be challenging because we live in a global\neconomy where the health of one major economy will affect the outlook of another.\nYet buying a weak currency and selling a strong one unknowingly can be a big\nmistake that translates into large losses, so it is extremely important for forex traders\nto learn how to pair strong with weak to maximize returns. After doing so you can\nuse technical analysis to help identify points of entry in the direction of the trend.\nIn 2015, for example, the European Central Bank introduced quantitative easing\n(QE) as a last ditch effort to boost inﬂation and stimulate growth. We know that\nQE lowers interest rates and erodes the value of a currency but selling euros blindly\non March 9, 2015, when the central bank started buying bonds for the very ﬁrst\ntime, yielded only a short-lived decline in the currency. Instead it would have been\nsmarter to look for opportunities to sell the currency against a strong one on rallies.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK150\nFIGURE 17.1 EURGBP Daily Chart—Quantitative Easing\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 17.2 NZDCAD Daily Chart—Oil\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK151One good candidate at the time was the British pound, which was beneﬁting from\neconomic improvements and had a central bank that was moving closer to raising\nrates. Figure 17.1 shows how there was a lot of consolidation in EURGBP near\n74 cents prior to the launch of Eurozone quantitative easing. This level proved to\nbe resistance when the pair rallied in late March. Traders could have sold them,\nassuming that resistance would hold, or waited for the pair to revisit that level in\nApril and May.\nAnother way to pair strong with weak is to follow the direction of commodity\nprices. Oil prices bottomed at $43.46 in early 2015, having traded above $100 a\nbarrel only 8 months earlier and started to turn higher in March. As a major oil\nproducer, Canada would stand to beneﬁt from stabilization in crude prices. At the\ntime U.S. policy makers were talking about raising interest rates, the Australian\ndollar was beneﬁtting from improving domestic conditions, and sterling soared on\npositive data and a victory by the incumbent during the 2015 general election.\nSelling any of these currencies and buying the Canadian dollar would have been a\nrisky endeavor. Instead the best bet at th e time was to sell the New Zealand dollar\nand buy the Canadian dollar or the NZDCAD pair because New Zealand reported\nextremely weak labor data that prompted policy makers to talk about easing. As\nyou can see in Figure 17.2, NZDCAD started to turn lower just as oil prices moved\nhigher in March.\nFIGURE 17.3 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK152The best way to gauge strong versus weak is to monitor economic data surprises.\nWhile the ECB was buying bonds and implementing quantitative easing, Eurozone\ndata started to improve and U.S. data started to weaken. The market had not\nanticipated this shift in dynamic as they had been looking for weak Eurozone data to\nreinforce QE and stronger U.S. data to push the Fed to tighten. This unexpected\nchange drove EURUSD sharply higher, and buying breakouts in April and May as\nshown in Figure 17.3 would have been good bets.\n153CHAPTER 18\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nThe Leveraged\nCarry Trade\nThe leverage carry trade strategy is the quintessential global macro trade that\nhas long been one of the favorite strategies of hedge funds and investment\nbanks. On its most fundamental level, the carry trade strategy involves buying\na high-yielding currency and funding it with the sale of a low-yielding currency.\nAggressive speculators will leave the trade unhedged with the hope that the high\nyielding currency will appreciate in value relative to the lower yielding currency,\nallowing them to earn the interest rate differential on top of the capital appreciation.\nMore conservative investors may choose to hedge the exchange rate component,\nearning only the interest rate differential. Although the differentials tend to be small,\nusually 1 to 3 percent if the position is leveraged 5 to 10 times, the proﬁts from\ninterest rates alone can be substantial. Of course it is important to remember that\nwhile leverage can magnify proﬁts, it can also exacerbate losses. Capital appreciation\ngenerally occurs when a number of traders identify proﬁt opportunities and pile into\nthe same trade, driving up the value of the currency pair.\nIn foreign exchange trading, the carry trade is a popular way to take advantage\nof the notion that money ﬂows in and out of different markets, driven by the law\nof supply and demand: with markets offering higher rates of return on investment\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE154attracting the most capital. Countries are no different—in the world of international\ncapital ﬂows, nations that offer the highest interest rates will generally attract more\ninvestment creating greater demand for their currencies. This helps to fuel the\ncarry trade. The carry trade strategy is simple to master, but like all strategies,\nit contains risk. Carry trades perf ormed extremely well between 2000 and 2007,\nfailed miserably between 2008 and 2009, and recovered between late 2012 into\n2015. The chance of loss can be great if you do not understand how, why, and when\ncarry trades work best.\n■How Do Carry Trades Work?\nTo understand carry trading, it is important to ﬁrst understand that currencies are\nalways traded in pairs, so taking a carry trade involves buying a currency that offers\na high interest rate and simultaneously selling a currency that offers a low interest\nrate. Carry trades are proﬁtable when the exchange rate remains unchanged in\nvalue and investors are able to earn the d ifference in interes t—or spread—between\nthe two currencies, or when it appreciates in value, allowing the investor to earn\nthe spread along with capital appreciation. If the exchange rate falls by more than\nthe spread on the interest rate, it becomes a net loss for the investor.\nLet’s take a look at an example: Assume that the Australian dollar offers an\ninterest rate of 4.75%, while the Swiss franc offers an interest rate of 0.25%. To\nexecute the carry trade, an investor buys the Australian dollar and sells the Swiss\nfranc. In doing so, he or she can earn a proﬁt of 4.50% (2.75% in interest earned\nminus 0.25% in interest paid), as long as the exchange rate between Australian\ndollars and Swiss francs do not change. Figure 18.1 shows exactly how an investor\nwould execute the carry trade.\nLong Short\nBuy AUD\n4.75%Sell CHF\n0.25%Investor\nReceives: 4.75% from long AUD\nposition\nPays: 0.25% through short USD\nfunding position\nProfit: 4.50% in interest rate\nspread, assuming spot rate is \nconstantEnters long AUD/USD trade:\nFIGURE 18.1 Leveraged Carry Trade Example\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE155To summarize : A carry trade involves buying a currency that offers a high interest\nrate while selling a currency that offers a low interest rate.\n■Why Do Carry Trades Work?\nInterest rates are very important: Carry trades work because of the constant\nmovement of capital into and out of different countries in search of the highest yield.\nInterest rates are the main reason why some countries attract more investment\nthan others. There are three reasons why a country can pay a higher interest rate.\nFirst, if a country’s economy is doing well (high growth, high productivity, low\nunemployment, rising incomes, etc.), it will be able to offer those who invest in the\ncountry a higher rate of return. Second, central banks can raise interest rates on fast\ngrowing economies with rising inﬂation. Third, countries with high debt to GDP\nratios, low credit ratings, and/or inherent growth problems may also need to pay a\nhigher interest rate to attract investment.\nInvestors prefer to earn higher interest rates: Investors who are interested in\nmaximizing their proﬁts will naturally look for investments that offer them the\nhighest rate of return. When making a decision to invest in a particular currency, an\ninvestor is more likely to choose one that offers the highest rate of return, or in this\ncase, interest rate. If several investors make this exact same decision, the country\nwill experience an inﬂow of capital from those seeking to earn a high rate of return,\nand the currency should appreciate.\nWhat about countries that are not doing well economically? Countries that have\nlow growth and low productivity will not be able to offer investors a high rate of\nreturn unless they have a very poor credit rating and are forced to offer a higher\nrate to compensate for the risk of holding the country’s bond or currency. With\nmajor economies, however, there will be times where growth is so weak that\ninterest rates are brought to zero, providing investors with no meaningful return.\nThe difference between countries that offer h igh interest rates versus countries that\noffer low interest rates is what makes carry trades possible.\nLet’s take another look at the carry trade example above in more detail.\nImagine an investor in Switzerland who is earning an interest rate of 0.25% per\nyear on her bank deposit in Swiss francs. At the time, a bank in Australia is offering\n4.75% per year on a deposit of Australian dollars. Seeing that interest rates are much\nhigher with the Australian bank, this in vestor would like to ﬁnd a way to earn this\nhigher rate of interest on her money.\nNow imagine that the investor could somehow trade her deposit of Swiss francs\nby paying 0.25% for a deposit of Australian dollars paying 4.75%. What she has\neffectively done is to ‘‘sell’’ her Swiss franc deposit and use those funds to ‘‘buy’’ an\nAustralian dollar deposit. With this transaction, she now owns an Australian dollar\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE156Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.2 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 1\ndeposit that pays her 4.75% in interest per year, 4.50% more than she was earning\nwith her Swiss franc deposit.\nThis investor has essentially just done a carry trade by ‘‘buying’’ an Australian\ndollar deposit, and ‘‘selling’’ a Swiss franc deposit.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows out of\nSwitzerland and into Australia, as investors take their Swiss francs and convert them\ninto Australian dollars. Australia attracts more capital because of the higher rates it\noffers. This inﬂow of capital increases the value of the currency (see Figure 18.2).\nTo summarize : Carry trades are made possible by the differences in interest rates\nbetween countries. B ecause they prefer to ea rn higher interest ra tes, investors will\nlook to buy and hold high interest rate paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Work Best?\nThere will be times when carry trades work better than others. In fact, carry trades\nare the most proﬁtable when there is a very speciﬁc attitude toward risk.\n■How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take?\nThe moods of people in general change over time—sometimes they may feel more\ndaring and willing to take chances; other times they may be more timid and prone to\nconservativeness. Investors, as a group, are no different. Sometimes they are willing\nto make investments that involve a good amount of risk; other times they are more\nfearful of losses and look to invest in safer assets.\nIn ﬁnancial jargon, when investors as a whole are willing to take on risk, we\ncall this low risk aversion, which means they are in risk-seeking mode. Alternatively,\nwhen investors are drawn to more conservative investments and less willing to take\no nr i s k ,w ed e s c r i b et h e ma s risk-averse .\nCarry trades are the most proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion .T h i s\nnotion makes sense when you consider what a carry trade involves. Remember, a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE157carry trade involves buying a currency that pays a high interest rate while selling a\ncurrency that pays a low interest rate. In buying the high interest rate currency, the\ninvestor is taking a risk because it is believed that a country needs to offer a higher\ninterest rate to offset the risk of holding th e currency. Also, while high interest rates\nattract investment, they can also hurt growth by raising the cost of borrowing. This\ncreates uncertainty around whether the economy of the country will continue to\nperform well and be able to pay not just high but even higher interest rates. This\nrisk is something a carry trade investor must be willing to take.\nIf investors as a whole were not willing to take on this risk, then capital would\nnever move from one country to another, and the carry trade opportunity would\nnot exist. Therefore, in order to return, carry trades require that investors as a\ngroup have low risk aversion, or be willing to bear the risk of investing in the higher\ninterest rate currency.\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the most proﬁtable when investors are willing\nto bear the risk of investing in high interest paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Not Work?\nSo far, we have shown that a carry trade will work best when investors have low\nrisk aversion. What happens when investors have high risk aversion ?\nCarry trades are the least proﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion .W h e n\ninvestors have high risk aversion, they are less willing as a group to take chances\nwith their investments. This means they would be less willing to invest in riskier\ncurrencies that offer higher interest rates. Instead, when investors have high risk\naversion they would actually prefer to put their money in ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies\nthat pay lower interest rates. During this time, they may also opt to close or unwind\ntheir carry trades. In doing so, they would be buying the currency with the low\ninterest rate and selling the curre ncy with the high interest rate.\nReturning to our earlier example, let’s assume the investor suddenly feels\nuncomfortable holding the foreign currency, the Australian dollar. Now, instead of\nlooking for the higher interest rate, she is more interested in keeping her investment\nsafe. As a result, she swaps her Australian dollars for more familiar Swiss francs.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows\nout of Australia and into Switzerland as investors take their Australian dollars and\nconvert them into Swiss francs. During this period of risk aversion, Switzerland\nattracts more capital due to the perceived safety of its currency, and the inﬂow of\ncapital increases the value of the Swiss franc (see Figure18.3).\nWhen investors have high risk aversion, they prefer to avoid the riskier high\ninterest rate paying currency and instea d invest in the safer, lower interest rate\npaying currency, which is the opposite of a carry trade.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE158Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.3 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 2\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the least proﬁtable in periods of uncertainty\nwhen investors are unwilling to bear the risk of investing in high interest paying\ncurrencies.\n■The Importance of Risk Aversion\nCarry trades will generally be proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion, and\nunproﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion. So before placing a carry trade\nit is important to understand the risk environment—whether investors as a whole\nhave high or low risk aversion—and when it changes .\nRising risk aversion is generally beneﬁcial for low interest rate paying currencies:\nSometimes the mood of investors will change rapidly, and investors’ willingness\nto make risky trades can change dramatically from one moment to the next.\nOften, these large shifts are caused by signiﬁcant global events. When periods\nof risk aversion occur quickly, the result is generally a large capital inﬂow into\nlow-interest-rate-paying ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies (see Figure 18.2).\nFor example, in the summer of 1998 the Japanese yen appreciated against the\ndollar by more than 20% over the span of two months, due to the Russian debt\ncrisis and LTCM hedge fund bailout. Similarly, just after the September 11 terrorist\nattacks the Swiss franc rose by more than 7% against the dollar over a 10-day period.\nDuring the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, we also saw big gains in the yen and the\nSwiss franc.\nThese sharp movements in currency values often occur when risk aversion quickly\nchanges from low to high. As a result, when risk aversion shifts, a carry trade can\nturn from being proﬁtable to unproﬁtable very quickly.\nRisk Aversion and Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nAs investor risk aversion goes from high to low, carry trades become more proﬁtable\nas detailed in Figure 18.4.\nHow do you know if investors as a whole have high or low risk aversion?\nUnfortunately, it is difﬁcult to measure investor risk aversion with a single number.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE1591 .

Low-interest currencies\ntend to remain weak, used in \nfinancing risky trades(–)( +)\nFIGURE 18.4 Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nOne way to get a broad idea of risk aversion levels is to look at bond yields. The\nwider the spread between the yields of bonds from different countries with similar\ncredit ratings, the higher the investor risk aversion. Bond yields are readily available\non major ﬁnancial websites such as Bloomberg.com and Reuters.com. In addition,\nseveral large banks have developed their own measures of risk aversion that signal\nwhen investors are willing to take risk and when they are not.\nOther Things to Bear in Mind When Considering a Carry Trade\nWhile risk aversion is one of the most important things to consider before making\na carry trade, it is not the only one. The following are some additional issues to be\naware of.\nLow Interest Rate Currency Appreciation\nBy entering into a carry trade, an investor is able to earn a proﬁt from the interest\nrate difference, or spread, between a high interest rate currency and a low interest\nrate currency. However, the carry trade can turn unproﬁtable if for some reason\n(like the risk aversion examples earlier), the low interest rate currency appreciates\nby a signiﬁcant amount.\nAside from rising risk aversion, improving economic conditions within a low\ninterest paying country can also cause its currency to appreciate. An ideal carry trade\nwill involve a low interest currency whose economy is weak and has low expectations\nfor growth. If the economy were to improve, however, the country might then be\nable to offer investors a higher rate of return through increased interest rates. If this\nwere to occur—again, using the previous example, say that Switzerland increased\nthe interest rates it offered—then investors may take advantage of these higher rates\nby investing in Swiss francs. As seen in Figure 18.3, an appreciation of the Swiss franc\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE160would negatively affect the proﬁtability of the Australian dollar–Swiss franc carry\ntrade. (At the very least, higher interest rates in Switzerland would negatively affect\nthe carry trade’s proﬁtability by lowering the interest rate spread.)\nThis same sequence of events may currently be unfolding for the Japanese yen.\nGiven its zero interest rates, the Jap anese yen has for a very long time been an\nideal low interest rate currency to use in carry trades (known as yen carry trades ).\nThis situation however, may be changing. Increased optimism about the Japanese\neconomy has recently led to an increase in the Japanese stock market. Increased\ninvestor demand for Japanese stocks and currency has caused the yen to appreciate,\nand this yen appreciation negatively affects the proﬁtability of carry trades like\nAustralian dollar (high interest rate) versus Japanese yen.\nIf investors continue to buy the yen, the yen carry trade could start to become\nunproﬁtable. This further illustrates the fact that when the low interest rate currency\nin a carry trade (the currency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the\nproﬁtability of the overall carry trade position.\nTrade Balances\nA country’s trade balance (the differen ce between imports and exports) can also\naffect the proﬁtability of a carry trade. We know that when investors have low\nrisk aversion or are risk seeking, capital will ﬂow from the low interest rate paying\ncurrency to the high interest rate paying currency (see Figure 18.2) but this does\nnot always happen.\nOne reason is because countries with large trade surplus can still see their\ncurrencies appreciate in low risk environments because running a trade surplus\nmeans that the country exports more than it imports. This creates naturally demand\nfor the currency.\nThe point of this example is to show that even when investors have low risk\naversion, large trade imbalances can cause a low interest rate currency to appreciate\n(as in Figure 18.3). And when the low interest rate currency in a carry trade (the\ncurrency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the proﬁtability of the carry\ntrade.\nTime Horizon\nIn general, a carry trade is a long-term strategy. Before entering into a carry trade,\nan investor should be willing to commit to a time-horizon of at least six months. This\ncommitment helps to make sure that the trade will not be affected by the ‘‘noise’’\nof shorter-term currency price movements.\nTo summarize : Carry trade investors should be aware of factors such as currency\nappreciation, trade balances, and time horizon before placing a trade. Any or all of\nthese factors can cause a seemingly proﬁtable carry trade to become unproﬁtable.\n161CHAPTER 19\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nMacro Event Driven\nTrade\nShort-term traders are generally focused only on the economic release of the\nweek and how it will impact their day trading activities. This works well for\nmany traders, but it is also important not to lose sight of the big macro events\nthat may be brewing in the economy or the world for that matter. Large-scale\nmacroeconomic events will move markets and will move them in very big ways.\nTheir impact goes beyond a simple one- or two-day price change because depending\non their size and scope, these occurrences have the potential to reshape the\nfundamental perception toward a currency for months or even years at a time.\nEvents such as wars, political uncertainly, natural disasters, and major international\nmeetings or monetary policy changes are so potent due to their irregularity that they\ncan have widespread psychological and physical impacts on the currency market.\nWith these events come both currencies that appreciate vastly and currencies that\ndepreciate just as dramatically. Therefore, keeping on top of global developments,\nunderstanding the underlying direction of market sentiment before and after these\nevents occur and anticipating them could be very proﬁtable, or at least can help\nprevent signiﬁcant losses.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE162■Know When Big Events Occur: Here Is a List\nof a Few Important Ones\n■Signiﬁcant G7 ﬁnance ministers meetings\n■Presidential elections\n■Important summits\n■Major Central Bank meetings\n■Potential changes to currency regimes\n■Possible debt defaults by large countries\n■Possible wars as a result of rising geopolitical tensions\n■Federal Reserve chairman’s semiannual testimony on economy\nThe best way to highlight the signiﬁcance of these events is look at a few notable\nmacroeconomic examples from the past two decades.\n2014 Ukraine–Russia Crisis\nThe 2014 Ukraine–Russia crisis was one of the biggest geopolitical events of the\npast decade. The crisis began in 2013 but didn’t really hit its peak until March\n2014 when Russia signed a bill to absorb Crimea. Leading up to the announcement,\nthe uncertainty put signiﬁcant pressure on the EURUSD in January 2014 with the\ncurrency pair dropping sharply on March 18, 2014, the day that Russia declared that\nCrimea was now ofﬁcially apart of their country. This led to a few more weeks of\ndownward pressure for the EURUSD as shown in Figure 19.1 as investors awaited\nthe world’s response. Many nations declared their support for Ukraine and war was\nfeared, but eventually Russia was only hit with sanctions, and a few months later,\nthe Ukraine crisis moved to the back burner.\nEuropean Sovereign Debt Crisis (2009–2013)\nThe European Sovereign Debt Crisis started in 2009 and lasted into 2013 with the bulk\nof the damage being done by February 2012. It was a multiyear debt crisis that was\nsparked by the inability of many member nations to meet their debt obligations after\nthe global ﬁnancial crisis. Their banking sectors and economies suffered signiﬁcant\nlosses, and persistently negative growth prospects made it impossible for countries\nsuch as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus to repay or reﬁnance their government\ndebt. Between 2010 and 2012, all of these na tions required bailouts or some form\nof support from the Troika, composed of the ECB, IMF and European Commission.\nWhile the problems were concentrated in smaller Eurozone nations, there was fear\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE163\nFIGURE 19.1 EURUSD Ukraine Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE164\nFIGURE 19.2 EURUSD Sovereign Debt Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nof contagion for the major economies. The country of Spain did not require a bailout\nbut in 2012, a number of banks required additional funding. The crisis posed caused\nsigniﬁcant volatility for the euro. Figure 19.2 shows two long periods of EURUSD\nweakness that were caused by bailouts, downgrades, and other negative headlines.\nGlobal Financial Crisis (2007–2009), Subprime\nOne of the most important macroeconomic events of the twenty-ﬁrst century was\nthe 2007 to 2009 subprime/global ﬁnancial crisis. It was triggered by a sharp slide\nin house prices, default on mortgages, and blowup of subprime mortgage backed\nsecurities and collateralized debt obligations. This, in turn, caused massive losses for\nbanks and ﬁnancial institutions, leading the failure of major ﬁrms such as Lehman\nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns. The impact on the ﬁnancial market and\nthe economy was staggering, with many countries falling into recession. During this\nperiod, the stock market lost more than 50% of its value with the S&P 500, falling\nfrom a high of 1,565 in October 2007 to a low of 676 in March 2009. As shown in\nFigure 19.3, USDJPY dropped from a high of 116.47 in October 2007 to a low of\n87.13 in January 2009. This was only the beginning of a multiyear decline for the\ncurrency pair. EURUSD had a delayed reaction, rallying strongly between October\n2007 and April 2008 as money ﬂowed out of the U.S. economy, and then falling\nsharply between July 2008 and October 2008 as the risk aversion and crisis spread\nto Europe.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE165\nFIGURE 19.3 USDJPY Global Financial Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nPolitical Uncertainty: 2004 U.S. Presidential Election\nAnother example of major events impacting the currency market is the 2004 U.S.\npresidential elections. In general, political instability causes perceived weakness\nin currencies. The hotly contested presidential election in November of 2004,\ncombined with the differences in the candidates’ stance on the growing budget\ndeﬁcit, resulted in overall dollar bearishness. The sentiment was exacerbated even\nfurther, given the lack of international support for the incumbent President (Bush)\ndue to the administration’s decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein. As a result, in\nthe three weeks leading up to the election, the euro rose 600 pips against the U.S.\ndollar. This can be seen in Figure 19.4. With a Bush victory becoming increasingly\nclear and later conﬁrmed, the dollar sold off against the majors as the market looked\nahead to what would probably end up being the maintenance of status quo. On the\nday following the election, the EURUSD rose another 200 pips and then continued\nto rise an additional 700 pips before peaking out six weeks later. This entire move\ntook place over the course of two months, which may seem like an eternity for\nmany, but this macroeconomic event really shaped the markets and for those who\nwere following it, big proﬁts could have been made. However, this is important\neven for short-term traders because given that the market was bearish dollars in\ngeneral leading up to the U.S. presidential election, a more prudent trade would be\nto look for opportunities to buy the EURUSD on dips rather than trying sell rallies\nand look for tops.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE166\nPost Election -\nAnother 700\nPip Rally \n600 Pip Rally\nPre Election\n2004 Election\nNight\nFIGURE 19.4 EURUSD Election Trade\nSource: eSignal\nG7 Meeting Dubai September 2003\nThe G7 ﬁnance ministers meeting on September 22, 2003, was a very important\nturning point for the markets. The dollar collapsed signiﬁcantly following the meeting\nat which the G7 ﬁnance ministers wanted to see ‘‘more ﬂexibility in exchange rates.’’\nDespite the rather tame nature of these words, the market interpreted this line to be\na major shift in policy. The last time changes to this degree had been made was back in\n2000. Taking a step back, the countries that constitute the G7 are the United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, and France. Collectively, these\ncountries account for two-thirds of the world’s total economic output. Not all G7\nmeetings are important. The only time the market really hones in on the G7 ﬁnance\nministers meeting is when they expect big changes to be made to the statement. In\n2000, the market paid particular attention to the upcoming meeting because there\nwas strong intervention in the EURUSD the day before the meeting. The meeting\nin September 2003 was also important because the U.S. trade deﬁcit was ballooning\nand becoming a huge issue. The EURUSD bore the brunt of the dollar depreciation\nwhile Japan and China were intervening aggressively in their currencies. As a result,\nit was widely expected that the G7 ﬁnance ministers as a whole would issue a\nstatement that was highly critical of Japan and China’s intervention policies. Leading\nup to the meeting, the U.S. dollar had alre ady begun to sell off as indicated by the\nchart. At the time of the announcement, the EURUSD shot up 150 pips. Though\nthis initial move was not ve ry substantial, between Se ptember 2003 and February\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE167\n6% Rally\n14% Rally\nSept 22, 2003\nG7 Meeting\nFIGURE 19.5 EURUSD G7 Meeting\nSource: eSignal\n2004 (which was the next G7 meeting), the dollar fell 8% on a trade-weighted\nbasis, 9% against the British pound, 11% against the euro, 7% against the yen,\nand 1.5% against the Canadian dollar. To put the percentages into perspective, a\nmove of 11% is equivalent to approximately 1100 pips. Therefore, the longer-term\nimpact is much more signiﬁcant than the immediate impact as the event itself has the\nsigniﬁcance to change the overall sentiment in the market. Figure 19.5 is a weekly\nchart of the EURUSD that illustrates how the currency pair performed following\nthe September 22, 2003 G7 meeting.\nU.S. War Against Iraq\nGeopolitical risks such as wars can also have a pronounced impact on the currency\nmarket. Figure 19.6 shows that bet ween December 2002 and February 2003, the\ndollar depreciated 9% against the Swiss franc (USDCHF) in the months leading up\nto war. The dollar sold off because the war itself was incredibly unpopular among\nthe international community. The Swiss franc was one of the primary beneﬁciaries\ndue to the country’s political neutrality an d safe-haven status. Between February\nand March, traders began to believe that the inevitable war would turn into a quick\nand decisive U.S. victory, so they began to unwind the war trade. This eventually\nled to a 3% rally in USDCHF as investors exited their short dollar positions.\nEach of these events caused large-scale movements in the currency market. Such\nevents are clearly important to follow for all types of traders. Keeping abreast of\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE168\nFIGURE 19.6 USDCHF Iraq War\nSource: eSignal\nbroad macroeconomic events can help traders make smarter decisions and prevent\nthem from fading large factors that may be brewing in the background. Most of\nthese events are talked about, debated, and anticipated many months in advance by\neconomists, currency analysts, and the international community in general.\n169CHAPTER 20\nQuantitative Easing\nand Its Impact on\nForex\nQuantitative easing is such an important topic that it deserves its own chapter.\nAfter the global ﬁnancial crisis many countries fell into recession, and in\nresponse central banks around the world lowered interest rates to record lows.\nWhen rates could not fall any lower, they had to resort to unprecedented measures,\nthe most powerful of which was quantit ative easing (QE). Between 2007 and 2015,\nthe Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and\nthe Swedish National Bank all resorted to QE, and their decision had a signiﬁcant\nimpact on their currencies on both a short- and long-term basis.\nThe goal of quantitative easing is to keep yields low and to ﬂood the market\nwith liquidity. To do so, a central bank would create money by buying ﬁnancial\nassets such as government bonds from banks using electronic cash. This basically\n‘‘creates new money.’’ It also keeps yields low because bond prices have an inverse\nrelationship with yields and in giving banks money, the hope is that it will encourage\nlending and in turn lead to more economic activity. The jury is out on how\nmuch QE really helped these economies, but the inﬂuence on currencies was\nundeniable.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX170■U.S. Quantitative Easing\nAfter the ﬁnancial crisis, the ﬁrst major central bank to respond with quantitative\neasing was the U.S. Federal Reserve. In November 2008, the central bank launched\na $600 billion bond-buying program. The program was initially effective as the\neconomy improved, prompting the Fed to temporarily halt bond purchases.\nHowever, the economy never gained additional momentum and as such, the central\nbank returned with a second round of QE (dubbed QE2) in November 2010. The\nsize of the program matched the ﬁrst round. Unfortunately, more bond buys were\nneeded, and QE3 was launched in September 2012. Unlike QE1 and QE2, QE3\nwas an open-ended program. The central bank announced plans to purchase $40\nbillion in assets every month, and in December 2012, that amount was increased\nto $85 billion per month. The program lasted for ﬁve years, and purchases were\nﬁnally halted in October 2014. Figure 20.1 shows how each round of quantitative\neasing impacted the EURUSD. As you can see, each round triggered a sharp rise in\nEURUSD and—another way to look at it—weakness in the U.S. dollar. In 2008,\nthe month that QE1 was announced, EURUSD surged 17% from high to low.\nWhen QE2 was announced, the EURUSD began a rally that took the pair up more\nthan 20%. QE3 led to a similar uptrend with gains extended when the program\nwas increased.\n■UK Quantitative Easing\nQuantitative easing was launched by the Bank of England in March 2009. At the\ntime, the BoE pledged to spend 75 billion pounds over a three-month period buying\nUK assets, but the program continue d and between March 2009 and January 2010,\nthe central bank had spent 200 billion pounds. In October 2011, growth started to\nslow more dramatically with the economy facing a double dip recession. In response\npolicymakers voted to increase the QE program by another 75 billion. In February\n2012, the central bank added another 50 billion and the same increase was made in\nJuly 2012, bringing the total program to 375 billion pounds. Figure 20.2 shows how\nGBPUSD responded to each round of QE. What is interesting is that the sterling\nfell sharply in the run up to the March 2009 announcement. It extended lower\nafterward but rebounded in the months that followed. In 2011, 2012, and 2013,\nthe sterling rallied the month that QE was announced. One important thing to\nremember is that the Federal Reserve was also buying bonds and expanding its own\nQE program at the time, so the two offset each other to some degree, limiting the\nreaction in GBPUSD. More importantly, investors interpreted each round of BoE\nQE as positive for the currency because they hoped that the central bank’s efforts\nwould help to turn around the economy.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk171\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.1 EURUSD US Fed QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk172\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.2 GBPUSD UK BoE QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk173\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.3 USDJPY Japan BoJ QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk174\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.4 EURUSD EZ ECB QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX175■Japan Quantitative Easing\nThe phrase quantitative easing was ﬁrst used by the Bank of Japan in 2001. At the time,\nthey did not believe that the program was effective but after the ﬁnancial crisis, they\nsaid they would examine their asset purchase program. In October 2011 the Bank of\nJapan increased the program by 5 trillion yen which was a small sum (approximately\nUSD$66 billion) compared to the staggering amounts that other countries were\npurchasing. Then in April 2013, they announced a bold and aggressive plan to\nbuy 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen a year as part of Prime Minister Abe’s economic\npolicies. This program was later expanded to 80 billion yen a year. Unlike other\ncountries where the effectiveness of QE was debated, Japan’s bond buying program\nplayed a large role in turning around the economy. It also had a signiﬁcant impact\non the currency. In Figure 20.3 we show how the ﬁrst program yielded a very small\nresponse in USDJPY but when the Bank of Japan came out in size, USDJPY reacted\nquickly and aggressively with a move that extended even further when the program\nwas expanded.\n■Eurozone Quantitative Easing\nThe European Central Bank was the last major central bank to roll out quantitative\neasing. They were reluctant to do so for a very long time because structurally the\nEurozone is not set up for quantitative easing. Since there is no euro-bond, some\ncritics felt that it was not in line with the central bank’s mandate. However faced\nwith sluggish growth, stubbornly low inﬂation, and an interest rate already at zero,\nthe ECB had very few options. They publicly discussed the option months before the\nactual decision, giving the market plenty of opportunity to discount the move. In\nJanuary 2015, the ECB announced that they would spend 60 billion euros per month\nbuying private and public bonds. In March 2015, ECB President Draghi unveiled\nan aggressive 1 trillion quantitative easing program. As shown in Figure 20.4, both\nannouncements had a signiﬁcant impact on the currency, but EURUSD stabilized\nafter the second announcement (but only after falling 500 pips) because investors\nhoped that the aggressive program by the central bank would help turn around\nthe economy.\nWhile no additional quantitative easing programs are expected as of mid-2015,\nthe unwinding of these unprecedented measures in the coming years should have\njust as much impact on currencies as the initial announcement itself, providing an\nopportunity for forex traders."

        "135CHAPTER 14\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: 20-Day\nBreakout Trade\nTrading breakouts can be both a rewarding and frustrating endeavor as breakouts\nhave a tendency to fail. A major reason why this can occur frequently in the\nforeign exchange market is because it is more technically driven than others and as a\nresult, there are many market participants who intentionally look to break pairs out\nin order to ‘‘suck’’ in other nonsuspecting traders. In an effort to ﬁlter out potential\nfalse breakouts, a price action screener should be used to identify breakouts that\nhave a higher probability of success. The rules behind this strategy are speciﬁcally\ndeveloped to take advantage of strong trending markets that make new highs that\nthen proceed to ‘‘fail’’ by taking out a recent low and then reverse again to make\nanother new high. This type of setup tends to have a very high success rate as it\nallows traders to enter strong trending markets after weaker players have been\nﬂushed out, only to have real money players reenter the market and push the pair\nup to new highs.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day high.\n2. Look for the pair to reverse the same day or next to make a two-day low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE1363. Buy the pair if it takes out the 20-day high within three days of making the\ntwo-day low.\n4. Place the initial stop a few pips below the two-day low.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nShorts:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day low.\n2. That day or the next the pair rallies to make a two-day high.\n3. Sell the pair if it trades below the 20-day low within three days of making the\ntwo-day high.\n4. Risk up to a few ticks above the two-day high.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nExamples\nNow take a look at our ﬁrst example in Figure 14.1. The daily chart of GBPUSD\nshows the currency pair making a new 20-day high on February 5. At this point,\nthe currency pair is on our radar, and we watch for a new two-day low to be made\nFIGURE 14.1 GBPUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE137within the next three days. This occurs right on schedule after which we wait for\nthe currency pair to make a new 20-day high, which occurs on February 12. At the\ntime, we buy GBPUSD a few pips above the previous 20-day high of 1.5352. We\nenter at 1.5360. The stop is placed a few pips below the original two-day low of\n1.5197 (or 1.5190). As the currency pair moves in our favor, we look to exit half\nof the position when it moves by the amount that we risked, which is 155 pips or\n1.5507. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or the\ninitial entry price of 1.5352. This rest of the trade is exited 24 hours later.\nFigure 14.2 provides an example of how the strategy can work in the EURUSD\nto the short side. On December 23, the currency pair makes a new 20-day low of\n1.2165. It goes on radar and we start looking for the currency pair to rebound within\nthe next three days. The recovery occurs the following day, and a new two-day\nhigh is made. Then we look for the previous 20-day low to be broken within the\nfollowing three days and that occurs shortly thereafter. At which point we enter\na short EURUSD trade at 1.2155 with a stop at 1.2260, or a few pips above the\ntwo-day high of 1.2254. Our risk on the trade is 105 pips. When the currency pair\ndrops to 1.2050, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. Then we trail the stop using a 2-bar high and end up exiting the\nremainder of the position at 1.1846.\nThe ﬁnal example shown in Figure 14.3 is in AUDUSD. The currency starts by\nmaking a new 20-day low on January 26. It goes on radar and we start looking\nfor the currency pair to rebound within the next three days. The recovery occurs\nFIGURE 14.2 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE138\nFIGURE 14.3 AUDUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nintraday, and a new two-day high is made right on schedule. Then we look for the\nprevious 20-day low to be broken within the following three days it occurs 24 hours\nafter the two-day high is made. At which point we enter a short AUDUSD trade a\nfew pips below the 20-day low at 0.7850 with a stop at 0.8032, or a few pips above\nthe two-day high of 0.8025. Our risk on the trade is 182 pips. When the currency\npair drops to 0.7668, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. The breakeven stop is triggered the very same day that the ﬁrst\ntarget is reached.\n139CHAPTER 15\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Channels\nChannel trading is a less exotic but popular trading technique for currencies. The\nreason why it can work is because currencies rarely spend much time in tight\ntrading ranges and have the tendency to develop strong trends. By reviewing a few\ncharts, traders can see that channels can easily be identiﬁed and occur frequently.\nA common scenario would be channel trading during the Asian session and a\nbreakout in either the London or U.S. session. There are many instances where\neconomic releases are one of the most common triggers for a break of the channel.\nTherefore, it is imperative that traders keep on top of economic releases. If a channel\nhas formed and a big U.S. number (per say) is expected to be released, and the\ncurrency pair is at the top of a channel, the probability of a break is high, so traders\nshould be looking to buy the break out, not fade it.\nChannels are created when we draw a trendline, and then draw a line that is\nparallel to that trendline. Most if not all of the price activity of the currency pair\nshould fall between the two channel lines. We will seek to identify situations where\nthe price is trading within a narrow channel, and then trade in the direction of a\nbreakout from the channel. This strategy can be particularly effective when used\nprior to a fundamental market event such as the release of major economic news, or\nprior to the ‘‘open’’ of a major ﬁnancial market.\nHere are some rules for using this technique to ﬁnd long trades:\n1. First, identify a channel on either an intraday or daily chart. The price should\nbe contained within a narrow range.\n2. Enter long as the price breaks above the upper channel line by 10 pips.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS1403. Place a stop at the lower channel line.\n4. Exit the position when it moves by double the amount risked.\nThe short rules are the reverse.\n■Examples\nLet examine a few examples. The ﬁrst example is a USDCAD 15-minute chart\nshown in Figure 15.1. The total range of the channel is approximately 30 pips with\nthe low being 1.2028 and the high 1.2056. In accordance with our strategy, we\nplace entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at 1.2018 and 1.2066. The\norder to buy gets triggered ﬁrst, and almost immediately we place a stop order\nat the low of the channel or 1.2028, which means we are risking 38 pips on the\ntrade. USDCAD then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of double the range at\n1.2142. More conservative traders could exit half of the position when it moves by\nthe amount risked, or 38 pips, and trail the stop on the remainder of the position.\nThe next example shown in Figure 15.2 is a 15-minute chart of EURGBP. The\ntotal range between the two lines is 12 p ips with the low being 0.7148 and the high\n0.7160. In accordance with our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and\nbelow the channel at 0.7138 and 0.7170. The order to buy gets triggered ﬁrst and\nalmost immediately we place a stop at the low of the channel or 0.7160 for 10-pip\nrisk. EURGBP then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of 20 pips or double\nthe amount risked.\nFIGURE 15.1 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS141\nFIGURE 15.2 EURGBP 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 15.3 EURUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFigure 15.3 is a 15-minute chart of the EURUSD. The total range during this\nfour-hour period is 18 pips with a high of 1.1206 and a low of 1.1188. In accordance\nwith our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at\n1.1216 and 1.1178. The order to sell gets triggered ﬁrst and almost immediately,\nwe place a stop order at the channel high of 1.1206 for a risk of 28 pips. The\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS142EURUSD then proceeds to sell off signiﬁcantly but only makes it to a low of 1.1132\nbefore stopping us out a few days later. We chose to show this example because it\nexplains why the more conservative approach of exiting half of the position when it\nmoves by the amount risk is more desirable, even though it has worse risk reward.\nA move of 58 pips is sizable on an intraday basis and may be difﬁcult to achieve.\nWhenever the risk is greater than 20 pips, it may be more prudent to exit half and\ntrail the stop.\n143CHAPTER 16\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Perfect\nOrder\nAperfect order in moving averages is deﬁned as a set of moving averages that\nis in sequential order. For an uptrend, a perfect order would be a situation\nin which the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) is at a higher price level than\nthe 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 50-day SMA. Meanwhile, the 100-day\nSMA would be below the 50-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA would be below\nthe 100-day SMA. In a downtrend, the opposite is true, where the 200-day SMA is\nat the highest level and the 10-day SMA is at the lowest level. Having the moving\naverages stacked up in sequential order are generally a strong indicator of a trending\nenvironment. Not only does it indicate that the momentum is on the side of trend,\nbut the moving averages also serve as multiple levels of support. To optimize the\nperfect order strategy, traders should also look for ADX to be greater than 20 and\ntrending upward. This represents a strong trend. Entry and exit levels are difﬁcult\nto determine with this strategy, but genera l l ys p e a k i n g ,w ew a n tt os t a yi nt h et r a d e\nfor as long as the perfect order remains in place and exit once the perfect order no\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER144longer holds. Perfect orders do not happen often, and the premise of this strategy is\nto capture the perfect order when it ﬁrst happens.\nThe perfect order seeks to take advantage of a trending environment near the\nbeginning of the trend:\n1. Look for a currency pair with moving averages in perfect order.\n2. Look for ADX pointing upwards, ideally greater than 20.\n3. Buy ﬁve candles after the initial formation of the perfect order (if it still\nholds).\n4. Initial stop is the low on the day of the initial crossover for longs and the high\nfor shorts.\n5. Exit the position when the perfect order no longer holds.\n■Examples\nFigure 16.1 is a daily chart of the EURUSD. In August 2014, the moving averages\nin the EURUSD formed a sequential perfect order. We check and see that ADX is\ngreater than 20, and we look to enter into a short trade ﬁve candles after the initial\nformation at 1.3390. Our initial stop is placed at the August 8 high of 1.3432. The\npair continues to move lower in the days and weeks that follow, and we remain in\nthe trade until the moving averages are no longer in perfect and the 10-day SMA\nmoves above the 20-day SMA, which occurs on October 17 when EURUSD settles\nthe day at 1.2758. The total proﬁt on this trade is 632 pips. We risked 42 pips on\nthe trade.\nThe next example is USDSGD. In Figure 16.2, the perfect order forms on\nNovember 6. We check and see that ADX is greater than 20, and we look to enter\ninto a long trade ﬁve candles after the initial formation at 1.2916. Our stop should\nbe at the November 6 low of 1.2911 but that is below our entry price so we put\nour stop at the 20-day SMA of 1.2822. The pair continues to move higher in the\nmonths that follow, and we remain in the trade until the moving averages are no\nlonger in perfect and the 10-day SMA moves below the 20-day SMA, which occurs\non March 27, when USD/SGD closes the day at 1.3685. The total move on this\ntrade is 770 pips for a risk of 89 pips.\nFigure 16.3 shows a perfect-order formation on a daily chart in USDJPY. The\nperfect order formed in October and when that occurred, we entered the trade\nﬁve days afterward at 116.20. Our stop was placed at 108.75, and we remained in\nthe trade until the 10-day SMA crossed below the 20-day SMA on December 19 at\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk145\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.1 EURUSD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk146\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.2 USDSGD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk147\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.3 USDJPY Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER148119.45. In this example, the proﬁt was 425 pips for a risk of 645 pips, which was\nfar from ideal.\nThe perfect order is a strategy that can be high proﬁt but low probability and\nlow frequency. This means there could be numerous stop outs before a long trend\nemerges. Also, when the currency pair moves more than 250 to 300 pips in proﬁt,\nyou may want to consider taking proﬁt on part of the positions.\n149CHAPTER 17\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nPairing Strong with\nWeak\nOne of the best ways to approach currency trading on a fundamental basis\nis to pair the strongest currency with the weakest. Of course ﬁnding that\npairing is rarely simple because it is not just about which countries are the strongest\nor weakest right now but instead which ones will become strong or weak going\nforward. Finding these currencies can also be challenging because we live in a global\neconomy where the health of one major economy will affect the outlook of another.\nYet buying a weak currency and selling a strong one unknowingly can be a big\nmistake that translates into large losses, so it is extremely important for forex traders\nto learn how to pair strong with weak to maximize returns. After doing so you can\nuse technical analysis to help identify points of entry in the direction of the trend.\nIn 2015, for example, the European Central Bank introduced quantitative easing\n(QE) as a last ditch effort to boost inﬂation and stimulate growth. We know that\nQE lowers interest rates and erodes the value of a currency but selling euros blindly\non March 9, 2015, when the central bank started buying bonds for the very ﬁrst\ntime, yielded only a short-lived decline in the currency. Instead it would have been\nsmarter to look for opportunities to sell the currency against a strong one on rallies.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK150\nFIGURE 17.1 EURGBP Daily Chart—Quantitative Easing\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 17.2 NZDCAD Daily Chart—Oil\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK151One good candidate at the time was the British pound, which was beneﬁting from\neconomic improvements and had a central bank that was moving closer to raising\nrates. Figure 17.1 shows how there was a lot of consolidation in EURGBP near\n74 cents prior to the launch of Eurozone quantitative easing. This level proved to\nbe resistance when the pair rallied in late March. Traders could have sold them,\nassuming that resistance would hold, or waited for the pair to revisit that level in\nApril and May.\nAnother way to pair strong with weak is to follow the direction of commodity\nprices. Oil prices bottomed at $43.46 in early 2015, having traded above $100 a\nbarrel only 8 months earlier and started to turn higher in March. As a major oil\nproducer, Canada would stand to beneﬁt from stabilization in crude prices. At the\ntime U.S. policy makers were talking about raising interest rates, the Australian\ndollar was beneﬁtting from improving domestic conditions, and sterling soared on\npositive data and a victory by the incumbent during the 2015 general election.\nSelling any of these currencies and buying the Canadian dollar would have been a\nrisky endeavor. Instead the best bet at th e time was to sell the New Zealand dollar\nand buy the Canadian dollar or the NZDCAD pair because New Zealand reported\nextremely weak labor data that prompted policy makers to talk about easing. As\nyou can see in Figure 17.2, NZDCAD started to turn lower just as oil prices moved\nhigher in March.\nFIGURE 17.3 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK152The best way to gauge strong versus weak is to monitor economic data surprises.\nWhile the ECB was buying bonds and implementing quantitative easing, Eurozone\ndata started to improve and U.S. data started to weaken. The market had not\nanticipated this shift in dynamic as they had been looking for weak Eurozone data to\nreinforce QE and stronger U.S. data to push the Fed to tighten. This unexpected\nchange drove EURUSD sharply higher, and buying breakouts in April and May as\nshown in Figure 17.3 would have been good bets.\n153CHAPTER 18\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nThe Leveraged\nCarry Trade\nThe leverage carry trade strategy is the quintessential global macro trade that\nhas long been one of the favorite strategies of hedge funds and investment\nbanks. On its most fundamental level, the carry trade strategy involves buying\na high-yielding currency and funding it with the sale of a low-yielding currency.\nAggressive speculators will leave the trade unhedged with the hope that the high\nyielding currency will appreciate in value relative to the lower yielding currency,\nallowing them to earn the interest rate differential on top of the capital appreciation.\nMore conservative investors may choose to hedge the exchange rate component,\nearning only the interest rate differential. Although the differentials tend to be small,\nusually 1 to 3 percent if the position is leveraged 5 to 10 times, the proﬁts from\ninterest rates alone can be substantial. Of course it is important to remember that\nwhile leverage can magnify proﬁts, it can also exacerbate losses. Capital appreciation\ngenerally occurs when a number of traders identify proﬁt opportunities and pile into\nthe same trade, driving up the value of the currency pair.\nIn foreign exchange trading, the carry trade is a popular way to take advantage\nof the notion that money ﬂows in and out of different markets, driven by the law\nof supply and demand: with markets offering higher rates of return on investment\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE154attracting the most capital. Countries are no different—in the world of international\ncapital ﬂows, nations that offer the highest interest rates will generally attract more\ninvestment creating greater demand for their currencies. This helps to fuel the\ncarry trade. The carry trade strategy is simple to master, but like all strategies,\nit contains risk. Carry trades perf ormed extremely well between 2000 and 2007,\nfailed miserably between 2008 and 2009, and recovered between late 2012 into\n2015. The chance of loss can be great if you do not understand how, why, and when\ncarry trades work best.\n■How Do Carry Trades Work?\nTo understand carry trading, it is important to ﬁrst understand that currencies are\nalways traded in pairs, so taking a carry trade involves buying a currency that offers\na high interest rate and simultaneously selling a currency that offers a low interest\nrate. Carry trades are proﬁtable when the exchange rate remains unchanged in\nvalue and investors are able to earn the d ifference in interes t—or spread—between\nthe two currencies, or when it appreciates in value, allowing the investor to earn\nthe spread along with capital appreciation. If the exchange rate falls by more than\nthe spread on the interest rate, it becomes a net loss for the investor.\nLet’s take a look at an example: Assume that the Australian dollar offers an\ninterest rate of 4.75%, while the Swiss franc offers an interest rate of 0.25%. To\nexecute the carry trade, an investor buys the Australian dollar and sells the Swiss\nfranc. In doing so, he or she can earn a proﬁt of 4.50% (2.75% in interest earned\nminus 0.25% in interest paid), as long as the exchange rate between Australian\ndollars and Swiss francs do not change.

There are three reasons why a country can pay a higher interest rate.\nFirst, if a country’s economy is doing well (high growth, high productivity, low\nunemployment, rising incomes, etc.), it will be able to offer those who invest in the\ncountry a higher rate of return. Second, central banks can raise interest rates on fast\ngrowing economies with rising inﬂation. Third, countries with high debt to GDP\nratios, low credit ratings, and/or inherent growth problems may also need to pay a\nhigher interest rate to attract investment.\nInvestors prefer to earn higher interest rates: Investors who are interested in\nmaximizing their proﬁts will naturally look for investments that offer them the\nhighest rate of return. When making a decision to invest in a particular currency, an\ninvestor is more likely to choose one that offers the highest rate of return, or in this\ncase, interest rate. If several investors make this exact same decision, the country\nwill experience an inﬂow of capital from those seeking to earn a high rate of return,\nand the currency should appreciate.\nWhat about countries that are not doing well economically? Countries that have\nlow growth and low productivity will not be able to offer investors a high rate of\nreturn unless they have a very poor credit rating and are forced to offer a higher\nrate to compensate for the risk of holding the country’s bond or currency. With\nmajor economies, however, there will be times where growth is so weak that\ninterest rates are brought to zero, providing investors with no meaningful return.\nThe difference between countries that offer h igh interest rates versus countries that\noffer low interest rates is what makes carry trades possible.\nLet’s take another look at the carry trade example above in more detail.\nImagine an investor in Switzerland who is earning an interest rate of 0.25% per\nyear on her bank deposit in Swiss francs. At the time, a bank in Australia is offering\n4.75% per year on a deposit of Australian dollars. Seeing that interest rates are much\nhigher with the Australian bank, this in vestor would like to ﬁnd a way to earn this\nhigher rate of interest on her money.\nNow imagine that the investor could somehow trade her deposit of Swiss francs\nby paying 0.25% for a deposit of Australian dollars paying 4.75%. What she has\neffectively done is to ‘‘sell’’ her Swiss franc deposit and use those funds to ‘‘buy’’ an\nAustralian dollar deposit. With this transaction, she now owns an Australian dollar\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE156Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.2 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 1\ndeposit that pays her 4.75% in interest per year, 4.50% more than she was earning\nwith her Swiss franc deposit.\nThis investor has essentially just done a carry trade by ‘‘buying’’ an Australian\ndollar deposit, and ‘‘selling’’ a Swiss franc deposit.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows out of\nSwitzerland and into Australia, as investors take their Swiss francs and convert them\ninto Australian dollars. Australia attracts more capital because of the higher rates it\noffers. This inﬂow of capital increases the value of the currency (see Figure 18.2).\nTo summarize : Carry trades are made possible by the differences in interest rates\nbetween countries. B ecause they prefer to ea rn higher interest ra tes, investors will\nlook to buy and hold high interest rate paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Work Best?\nThere will be times when carry trades work better than others. In fact, carry trades\nare the most proﬁtable when there is a very speciﬁc attitude toward risk.\n■How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take?\nThe moods of people in general change over time—sometimes they may feel more\ndaring and willing to take chances; other times they may be more timid and prone to\nconservativeness. Investors, as a group, are no different. Sometimes they are willing\nto make investments that involve a good amount of risk; other times they are more\nfearful of losses and look to invest in safer assets.\nIn ﬁnancial jargon, when investors as a whole are willing to take on risk, we\ncall this low risk aversion, which means they are in risk-seeking mode. Alternatively,\nwhen investors are drawn to more conservative investments and less willing to take\no nr i s k ,w ed e s c r i b et h e ma s risk-averse .\nCarry trades are the most proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion .T h i s\nnotion makes sense when you consider what a carry trade involves. Remember, a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE157carry trade involves buying a currency that pays a high interest rate while selling a\ncurrency that pays a low interest rate. In buying the high interest rate currency, the\ninvestor is taking a risk because it is believed that a country needs to offer a higher\ninterest rate to offset the risk of holding th e currency. Also, while high interest rates\nattract investment, they can also hurt growth by raising the cost of borrowing. This\ncreates uncertainty around whether the economy of the country will continue to\nperform well and be able to pay not just high but even higher interest rates. This\nrisk is something a carry trade investor must be willing to take.\nIf investors as a whole were not willing to take on this risk, then capital would\nnever move from one country to another, and the carry trade opportunity would\nnot exist. Therefore, in order to return, carry trades require that investors as a\ngroup have low risk aversion, or be willing to bear the risk of investing in the higher\ninterest rate currency.\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the most proﬁtable when investors are willing\nto bear the risk of investing in high interest paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Not Work?\nSo far, we have shown that a carry trade will work best when investors have low\nrisk aversion. What happens when investors have high risk aversion ?\nCarry trades are the least proﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion .W h e n\ninvestors have high risk aversion, they are less willing as a group to take chances\nwith their investments. This means they would be less willing to invest in riskier\ncurrencies that offer higher interest rates. Instead, when investors have high risk\naversion they would actually prefer to put their money in ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies\nthat pay lower interest rates. During this time, they may also opt to close or unwind\ntheir carry trades. In doing so, they would be buying the currency with the low\ninterest rate and selling the curre ncy with the high interest rate.\nReturning to our earlier example, let’s assume the investor suddenly feels\nuncomfortable holding the foreign currency, the Australian dollar. Now, instead of\nlooking for the higher interest rate, she is more interested in keeping her investment\nsafe. As a result, she swaps her Australian dollars for more familiar Swiss francs.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows\nout of Australia and into Switzerland as investors take their Australian dollars and\nconvert them into Swiss francs. During this period of risk aversion, Switzerland\nattracts more capital due to the perceived safety of its currency, and the inﬂow of\ncapital increases the value of the Swiss franc (see Figure18.3).\nWhen investors have high risk aversion, they prefer to avoid the riskier high\ninterest rate paying currency and instea d invest in the safer, lower interest rate\npaying currency, which is the opposite of a carry trade.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE158Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.3 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 2\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the least proﬁtable in periods of uncertainty\nwhen investors are unwilling to bear the risk of investing in high interest paying\ncurrencies.\n■The Importance of Risk Aversion\nCarry trades will generally be proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion, and\nunproﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion. So before placing a carry trade\nit is important to understand the risk environment—whether investors as a whole\nhave high or low risk aversion—and when it changes .\nRising risk aversion is generally beneﬁcial for low interest rate paying currencies:\nSometimes the mood of investors will change rapidly, and investors’ willingness\nto make risky trades can change dramatically from one moment to the next.\nOften, these large shifts are caused by signiﬁcant global events. When periods\nof risk aversion occur quickly, the result is generally a large capital inﬂow into\nlow-interest-rate-paying ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies (see Figure 18.2).\nFor example, in the summer of 1998 the Japanese yen appreciated against the\ndollar by more than 20% over the span of two months, due to the Russian debt\ncrisis and LTCM hedge fund bailout. Similarly, just after the September 11 terrorist\nattacks the Swiss franc rose by more than 7% against the dollar over a 10-day period.\nDuring the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, we also saw big gains in the yen and the\nSwiss franc.\nThese sharp movements in currency values often occur when risk aversion quickly\nchanges from low to high. As a result, when risk aversion shifts, a carry trade can\nturn from being proﬁtable to unproﬁtable very quickly.\nRisk Aversion and Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nAs investor risk aversion goes from high to low, carry trades become more proﬁtable\nas detailed in Figure 18.4.\nHow do you know if investors as a whole have high or low risk aversion?\nUnfortunately, it is difﬁcult to measure investor risk aversion with a single number.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE1591 .

Low-interest currencies\ntend to remain weak, used in \nfinancing risky trades(–)( +)\nFIGURE 18.4 Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nOne way to get a broad idea of risk aversion levels is to look at bond yields. The\nwider the spread between the yields of bonds from different countries with similar\ncredit ratings, the higher the investor risk aversion. Bond yields are readily available\non major ﬁnancial websites such as Bloomberg.com and Reuters.com. In addition,\nseveral large banks have developed their own measures of risk aversion that signal\nwhen investors are willing to take risk and when they are not.\nOther Things to Bear in Mind When Considering a Carry Trade\nWhile risk aversion is one of the most important things to consider before making\na carry trade, it is not the only one. The following are some additional issues to be\naware of.\nLow Interest Rate Currency Appreciation\nBy entering into a carry trade, an investor is able to earn a proﬁt from the interest\nrate difference, or spread, between a high interest rate currency and a low interest\nrate currency. However, the carry trade can turn unproﬁtable if for some reason\n(like the risk aversion examples earlier), the low interest rate currency appreciates\nby a signiﬁcant amount.\nAside from rising risk aversion, improving economic conditions within a low\ninterest paying country can also cause its currency to appreciate. An ideal carry trade\nwill involve a low interest currency whose economy is weak and has low expectations\nfor growth. If the economy were to improve, however, the country might then be\nable to offer investors a higher rate of return through increased interest rates. If this\nwere to occur—again, using the previous example, say that Switzerland increased\nthe interest rates it offered—then investors may take advantage of these higher rates\nby investing in Swiss francs. As seen in Figure 18.3, an appreciation of the Swiss franc\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE160would negatively affect the proﬁtability of the Australian dollar–Swiss franc carry\ntrade. (At the very least, higher interest rates in Switzerland would negatively affect\nthe carry trade’s proﬁtability by lowering the interest rate spread.)\nThis same sequence of events may currently be unfolding for the Japanese yen.\nGiven its zero interest rates, the Jap anese yen has for a very long time been an\nideal low interest rate currency to use in carry trades (known as yen carry trades ).\nThis situation however, may be changing. Increased optimism about the Japanese\neconomy has recently led to an increase in the Japanese stock market. Increased\ninvestor demand for Japanese stocks and currency has caused the yen to appreciate,\nand this yen appreciation negatively affects the proﬁtability of carry trades like\nAustralian dollar (high interest rate) versus Japanese yen.\nIf investors continue to buy the yen, the yen carry trade could start to become\nunproﬁtable. This further illustrates the fact that when the low interest rate currency\nin a carry trade (the currency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the\nproﬁtability of the overall carry trade position.\nTrade Balances\nA country’s trade balance (the differen ce between imports and exports) can also\naffect the proﬁtability of a carry trade. We know that when investors have low\nrisk aversion or are risk seeking, capital will ﬂow from the low interest rate paying\ncurrency to the high interest rate paying currency (see Figure 18.2) but this does\nnot always happen.\nOne reason is because countries with large trade surplus can still see their\ncurrencies appreciate in low risk environments because running a trade surplus\nmeans that the country exports more than it imports. This creates naturally demand\nfor the currency.\nThe point of this example is to show that even when investors have low risk\naversion, large trade imbalances can cause a low interest rate currency to appreciate\n(as in Figure 18.3). And when the low interest rate currency in a carry trade (the\ncurrency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the proﬁtability of the carry\ntrade.\nTime Horizon\nIn general, a carry trade is a long-term strategy. Before entering into a carry trade,\nan investor should be willing to commit to a time-horizon of at least six months. This\ncommitment helps to make sure that the trade will not be affected by the ‘‘noise’’\nof shorter-term currency price movements.\nTo summarize : Carry trade investors should be aware of factors such as currency\nappreciation, trade balances, and time horizon before placing a trade. Any or all of\nthese factors can cause a seemingly proﬁtable carry trade to become unproﬁtable.\n161CHAPTER 19\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nMacro Event Driven\nTrade\nShort-term traders are generally focused only on the economic release of the\nweek and how it will impact their day trading activities. This works well for\nmany traders, but it is also important not to lose sight of the big macro events\nthat may be brewing in the economy or the world for that matter. Large-scale\nmacroeconomic events will move markets and will move them in very big ways.\nTheir impact goes beyond a simple one- or two-day price change because depending\non their size and scope, these occurrences have the potential to reshape the\nfundamental perception toward a currency for months or even years at a time.\nEvents such as wars, political uncertainly, natural disasters, and major international\nmeetings or monetary policy changes are so potent due to their irregularity that they\ncan have widespread psychological and physical impacts on the currency market.\nWith these events come both currencies that appreciate vastly and currencies that\ndepreciate just as dramatically. Therefore, keeping on top of global developments,\nunderstanding the underlying direction of market sentiment before and after these\nevents occur and anticipating them could be very proﬁtable, or at least can help\nprevent signiﬁcant losses.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE162■Know When Big Events Occur: Here Is a List\nof a Few Important Ones\n■Signiﬁcant G7 ﬁnance ministers meetings\n■Presidential elections\n■Important summits\n■Major Central Bank meetings\n■Potential changes to currency regimes\n■Possible debt defaults by large countries\n■Possible wars as a result of rising geopolitical tensions\n■Federal Reserve chairman’s semiannual testimony on economy\nThe best way to highlight the signiﬁcance of these events is look at a few notable\nmacroeconomic examples from the past two decades.\n2014 Ukraine–Russia Crisis\nThe 2014 Ukraine–Russia crisis was one of the biggest geopolitical events of the\npast decade. The crisis began in 2013 but didn’t really hit its peak until March\n2014 when Russia signed a bill to absorb Crimea. Leading up to the announcement,\nthe uncertainty put signiﬁcant pressure on the EURUSD in January 2014 with the\ncurrency pair dropping sharply on March 18, 2014, the day that Russia declared that\nCrimea was now ofﬁcially apart of their country. This led to a few more weeks of\ndownward pressure for the EURUSD as shown in Figure 19.1 as investors awaited\nthe world’s response. Many nations declared their support for Ukraine and war was\nfeared, but eventually Russia was only hit with sanctions, and a few months later,\nthe Ukraine crisis moved to the back burner.\nEuropean Sovereign Debt Crisis (2009–2013)\nThe European Sovereign Debt Crisis started in 2009 and lasted into 2013 with the bulk\nof the damage being done by February 2012. It was a multiyear debt crisis that was\nsparked by the inability of many member nations to meet their debt obligations after\nthe global ﬁnancial crisis. Their banking sectors and economies suffered signiﬁcant\nlosses, and persistently negative growth prospects made it impossible for countries\nsuch as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus to repay or reﬁnance their government\ndebt. Between 2010 and 2012, all of these na tions required bailouts or some form\nof support from the Troika, composed of the ECB, IMF and European Commission.\nWhile the problems were concentrated in smaller Eurozone nations, there was fear\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE163\nFIGURE 19.1 EURUSD Ukraine Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE164\nFIGURE 19.2 EURUSD Sovereign Debt Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nof contagion for the major economies. The country of Spain did not require a bailout\nbut in 2012, a number of banks required additional funding. The crisis posed caused\nsigniﬁcant volatility for the euro. Figure 19.2 shows two long periods of EURUSD\nweakness that were caused by bailouts, downgrades, and other negative headlines.\nGlobal Financial Crisis (2007–2009), Subprime\nOne of the most important macroeconomic events of the twenty-ﬁrst century was\nthe 2007 to 2009 subprime/global ﬁnancial crisis. It was triggered by a sharp slide\nin house prices, default on mortgages, and blowup of subprime mortgage backed\nsecurities and collateralized debt obligations. This, in turn, caused massive losses for\nbanks and ﬁnancial institutions, leading the failure of major ﬁrms such as Lehman\nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns. The impact on the ﬁnancial market and\nthe economy was staggering, with many countries falling into recession. During this\nperiod, the stock market lost more than 50% of its value with the S&P 500, falling\nfrom a high of 1,565 in October 2007 to a low of 676 in March 2009. As shown in\nFigure 19.3, USDJPY dropped from a high of 116.47 in October 2007 to a low of\n87.13 in January 2009. This was only the beginning of a multiyear decline for the\ncurrency pair. EURUSD had a delayed reaction, rallying strongly between October\n2007 and April 2008 as money ﬂowed out of the U.S. economy, and then falling\nsharply between July 2008 and October 2008 as the risk aversion and crisis spread\nto Europe.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE165\nFIGURE 19.3 USDJPY Global Financial Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nPolitical Uncertainty: 2004 U.S. Presidential Election\nAnother example of major events impacting the currency market is the 2004 U.S.\npresidential elections. In general, political instability causes perceived weakness\nin currencies. The hotly contested presidential election in November of 2004,\ncombined with the differences in the candidates’ stance on the growing budget\ndeﬁcit, resulted in overall dollar bearishness. The sentiment was exacerbated even\nfurther, given the lack of international support for the incumbent President (Bush)\ndue to the administration’s decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein. As a result, in\nthe three weeks leading up to the election, the euro rose 600 pips against the U.S.\ndollar. This can be seen in Figure 19.4. With a Bush victory becoming increasingly\nclear and later conﬁrmed, the dollar sold off against the majors as the market looked\nahead to what would probably end up being the maintenance of status quo. On the\nday following the election, the EURUSD rose another 200 pips and then continued\nto rise an additional 700 pips before peaking out six weeks later. This entire move\ntook place over the course of two months, which may seem like an eternity for\nmany, but this macroeconomic event really shaped the markets and for those who\nwere following it, big proﬁts could have been made. However, this is important\neven for short-term traders because given that the market was bearish dollars in\ngeneral leading up to the U.S. presidential election, a more prudent trade would be\nto look for opportunities to buy the EURUSD on dips rather than trying sell rallies\nand look for tops.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE166\nPost Election -\nAnother 700\nPip Rally \n600 Pip Rally\nPre Election\n2004 Election\nNight\nFIGURE 19.4 EURUSD Election Trade\nSource: eSignal\nG7 Meeting Dubai September 2003\nThe G7 ﬁnance ministers meeting on September 22, 2003, was a very important\nturning point for the markets. The dollar collapsed signiﬁcantly following the meeting\nat which the G7 ﬁnance ministers wanted to see ‘‘more ﬂexibility in exchange rates.’’\nDespite the rather tame nature of these words, the market interpreted this line to be\na major shift in policy. The last time changes to this degree had been made was back in\n2000. Taking a step back, the countries that constitute the G7 are the United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, and France. Collectively, these\ncountries account for two-thirds of the world’s total economic output. Not all G7\nmeetings are important. The only time the market really hones in on the G7 ﬁnance\nministers meeting is when they expect big changes to be made to the statement. In\n2000, the market paid particular attention to the upcoming meeting because there\nwas strong intervention in the EURUSD the day before the meeting. The meeting\nin September 2003 was also important because the U.S. trade deﬁcit was ballooning\nand becoming a huge issue. The EURUSD bore the brunt of the dollar depreciation\nwhile Japan and China were intervening aggressively in their currencies. As a result,\nit was widely expected that the G7 ﬁnance ministers as a whole would issue a\nstatement that was highly critical of Japan and China’s intervention policies. Leading\nup to the meeting, the U.S. dollar had alre ady begun to sell off as indicated by the\nchart. At the time of the announcement, the EURUSD shot up 150 pips. Though\nthis initial move was not ve ry substantial, between Se ptember 2003 and February\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE167\n6% Rally\n14% Rally\nSept 22, 2003\nG7 Meeting\nFIGURE 19.5 EURUSD G7 Meeting\nSource: eSignal\n2004 (which was the next G7 meeting), the dollar fell 8% on a trade-weighted\nbasis, 9% against the British pound, 11% against the euro, 7% against the yen,\nand 1.5% against the Canadian dollar. To put the percentages into perspective, a\nmove of 11% is equivalent to approximately 1100 pips. Therefore, the longer-term\nimpact is much more signiﬁcant than the immediate impact as the event itself has the\nsigniﬁcance to change the overall sentiment in the market. Figure 19.5 is a weekly\nchart of the EURUSD that illustrates how the currency pair performed following\nthe September 22, 2003 G7 meeting.\nU.S. War Against Iraq\nGeopolitical risks such as wars can also have a pronounced impact on the currency\nmarket. Figure 19.6 shows that bet ween December 2002 and February 2003, the\ndollar depreciated 9% against the Swiss franc (USDCHF) in the months leading up\nto war. The dollar sold off because the war itself was incredibly unpopular among\nthe international community. The Swiss franc was one of the primary beneﬁciaries\ndue to the country’s political neutrality an d safe-haven status. Between February\nand March, traders began to believe that the inevitable war would turn into a quick\nand decisive U.S. victory, so they began to unwind the war trade. This eventually\nled to a 3% rally in USDCHF as investors exited their short dollar positions.\nEach of these events caused large-scale movements in the currency market. Such\nevents are clearly important to follow for all types of traders. Keeping abreast of\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE168\nFIGURE 19.6 USDCHF Iraq War\nSource: eSignal\nbroad macroeconomic events can help traders make smarter decisions and prevent\nthem from fading large factors that may be brewing in the background. Most of\nthese events are talked about, debated, and anticipated many months in advance by\neconomists, currency analysts, and the international community in general.\n169CHAPTER 20\nQuantitative Easing\nand Its Impact on\nForex\nQuantitative easing is such an important topic that it deserves its own chapter.\nAfter the global ﬁnancial crisis many countries fell into recession, and in\nresponse central banks around the world lowered interest rates to record lows.\nWhen rates could not fall any lower, they had to resort to unprecedented measures,\nthe most powerful of which was quantit ative easing (QE). Between 2007 and 2015,\nthe Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and\nthe Swedish National Bank all resorted to QE, and their decision had a signiﬁcant\nimpact on their currencies on both a short- and long-term basis.\nThe goal of quantitative easing is to keep yields low and to ﬂood the market\nwith liquidity. To do so, a central bank would create money by buying ﬁnancial\nassets such as government bonds from banks using electronic cash. This basically\n‘‘creates new money.’’ It also keeps yields low because bond prices have an inverse\nrelationship with yields and in giving banks money, the hope is that it will encourage\nlending and in turn lead to more economic activity. The jury is out on how\nmuch QE really helped these economies, but the inﬂuence on currencies was\nundeniable.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX170■U.S. Quantitative Easing\nAfter the ﬁnancial crisis, the ﬁrst major central bank to respond with quantitative\neasing was the U.S. Federal Reserve. In November 2008, the central bank launched\na $600 billion bond-buying program. The program was initially effective as the\neconomy improved, prompting the Fed to temporarily halt bond purchases.\nHowever, the economy never gained additional momentum and as such, the central\nbank returned with a second round of QE (dubbed QE2) in November 2010. The\nsize of the program matched the ﬁrst round. Unfortunately, more bond buys were\nneeded, and QE3 was launched in September 2012. Unlike QE1 and QE2, QE3\nwas an open-ended program. The central bank announced plans to purchase $40\nbillion in assets every month, and in December 2012, that amount was increased\nto $85 billion per month. The program lasted for ﬁve years, and purchases were\nﬁnally halted in October 2014. Figure 20.1 shows how each round of quantitative\neasing impacted the EURUSD. As you can see, each round triggered a sharp rise in\nEURUSD and—another way to look at it—weakness in the U.S. dollar. In 2008,\nthe month that QE1 was announced, EURUSD surged 17% from high to low.\nWhen QE2 was announced, the EURUSD began a rally that took the pair up more\nthan 20%. QE3 led to a similar uptrend with gains extended when the program\nwas increased.\n■UK Quantitative Easing\nQuantitative easing was launched by the Bank of England in March 2009. At the\ntime, the BoE pledged to spend 75 billion pounds over a three-month period buying\nUK assets, but the program continue d and between March 2009 and January 2010,\nthe central bank had spent 200 billion pounds. In October 2011, growth started to\nslow more dramatically with the economy facing a double dip recession. In response\npolicymakers voted to increase the QE program by another 75 billion. In February\n2012, the central bank added another 50 billion and the same increase was made in\nJuly 2012, bringing the total program to 375 billion pounds. Figure 20.2 shows how\nGBPUSD responded to each round of QE. What is interesting is that the sterling\nfell sharply in the run up to the March 2009 announcement. It extended lower\nafterward but rebounded in the months that followed. In 2011, 2012, and 2013,\nthe sterling rallied the month that QE was announced. One important thing to\nremember is that the Federal Reserve was also buying bonds and expanding its own\nQE program at the time, so the two offset each other to some degree, limiting the\nreaction in GBPUSD. More importantly, investors interpreted each round of BoE\nQE as positive for the currency because they hoped that the central bank’s efforts\nwould help to turn around the economy.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk171\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.1 EURUSD US Fed QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk172\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.2 GBPUSD UK BoE QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk173\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.3 USDJPY Japan BoJ QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk174\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.4 EURUSD EZ ECB QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX175■Japan Quantitative Easing\nThe phrase quantitative easing was ﬁrst used by the Bank of Japan in 2001. At the time,\nthey did not believe that the program was effective but after the ﬁnancial crisis, they\nsaid they would examine their asset purchase program. In October 2011 the Bank of\nJapan increased the program by 5 trillion yen which was a small sum (approximately\nUSD$66 billion) compared to the staggering amounts that other countries were\npurchasing. Then in April 2013, they announced a bold and aggressive plan to\nbuy 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen a year as part of Prime Minister Abe’s economic\npolicies. This program was later expanded to 80 billion yen a year. Unlike other\ncountries where the effectiveness of QE was debated, Japan’s bond buying program\nplayed a large role in turning around the economy. It also had a signiﬁcant impact\non the currency. In Figure 20.3 we show how the ﬁrst program yielded a very small\nresponse in USDJPY but when the Bank of Japan came out in size, USDJPY reacted\nquickly and aggressively with a move that extended even further when the program\nwas expanded.\n■Eurozone Quantitative Easing\nThe European Central Bank was the last major central bank to roll out quantitative\neasing. They were reluctant to do so for a very long time because structurally the\nEurozone is not set up for quantitative easing. Since there is no euro-bond, some\ncritics felt that it was not in line with the central bank’s mandate. However faced\nwith sluggish growth, stubbornly low inﬂation, and an interest rate already at zero,\nthe ECB had very few options. They publicly discussed the option months before the\nactual decision, giving the market plenty of opportunity to discount the move. In\nJanuary 2015, the ECB announced that they would spend 60 billion euros per month\nbuying private and public bonds. In March 2015, ECB President Draghi unveiled\nan aggressive 1 trillion quantitative easing program. As shown in Figure 20.4, both\nannouncements had a signiﬁcant impact on the currency, but EURUSD stabilized\nafter the second announcement (but only after falling 500 pips) because investors\nhoped that the aggressive program by the central bank would help turn around\nthe economy.\nWhile no additional quantitative easing programs are expected as of mid-2015,\nthe unwinding of these unprecedented measures in the coming years should have\njust as much impact on currencies as the initial announcement itself, providing an\nopportunity for forex traders.",
        "135CHAPTER 14\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: 20-Day\nBreakout Trade\nTrading breakouts can be both a rewarding and frustrating endeavor as breakouts\nhave a tendency to fail. A major reason why this can occur frequently in the\nforeign exchange market is because it is more technically driven than others and as a\nresult, there are many market participants who intentionally look to break pairs out\nin order to ‘‘suck’’ in other nonsuspecting traders. In an effort to ﬁlter out potential\nfalse breakouts, a price action screener should be used to identify breakouts that\nhave a higher probability of success. The rules behind this strategy are speciﬁcally\ndeveloped to take advantage of strong trending markets that make new highs that\nthen proceed to ‘‘fail’’ by taking out a recent low and then reverse again to make\nanother new high. This type of setup tends to have a very high success rate as it\nallows traders to enter strong trending markets after weaker players have been\nﬂushed out, only to have real money players reenter the market and push the pair\nup to new highs.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day high.\n2. Look for the pair to reverse the same day or next to make a two-day low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE1363. Buy the pair if it takes out the 20-day high within three days of making the\ntwo-day low.\n4. Place the initial stop a few pips below the two-day low.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nShorts:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day low.\n2. That day or the next the pair rallies to make a two-day high.\n3. Sell the pair if it trades below the 20-day low within three days of making the\ntwo-day high.\n4. Risk up to a few ticks above the two-day high.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nExamples\nNow take a look at our ﬁrst example in Figure 14.1. The daily chart of GBPUSD\nshows the currency pair making a new 20-day high on February 5. At this point,\nthe currency pair is on our radar, and we watch for a new two-day low to be made\nFIGURE 14.1 GBPUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE137within the next three days. This occurs right on schedule after which we wait for\nthe currency pair to make a new 20-day high, which occurs on February 12. At the\ntime, we buy GBPUSD a few pips above the previous 20-day high of 1.5352. We\nenter at 1.5360. The stop is placed a few pips below the original two-day low of\n1.5197 (or 1.5190). As the currency pair moves in our favor, we look to exit half\nof the position when it moves by the amount that we risked, which is 155 pips or\n1.5507. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or the\ninitial entry price of 1.5352. This rest of the trade is exited 24 hours later.\nFigure 14.2 provides an example of how the strategy can work in the EURUSD\nto the short side. On December 23, the currency pair makes a new 20-day low of\n1.2165. It goes on radar and we start looking for the currency pair to rebound within\nthe next three days. The recovery occurs the following day, and a new two-day\nhigh is made. Then we look for the previous 20-day low to be broken within the\nfollowing three days and that occurs shortly thereafter. At which point we enter\na short EURUSD trade at 1.2155 with a stop at 1.2260, or a few pips above the\ntwo-day high of 1.2254. Our risk on the trade is 105 pips. When the currency pair\ndrops to 1.2050, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. Then we trail the stop using a 2-bar high and end up exiting the\nremainder of the position at 1.1846.\nThe ﬁnal example shown in Figure 14.3 is in AUDUSD. The currency starts by\nmaking a new 20-day low on January 26. It goes on radar and we start looking\nfor the currency pair to rebound within the next three days. The recovery occurs\nFIGURE 14.2 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE138\nFIGURE 14.3 AUDUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nintraday, and a new two-day high is made right on schedule. Then we look for the\nprevious 20-day low to be broken within the following three days it occurs 24 hours\nafter the two-day high is made. At which point we enter a short AUDUSD trade a\nfew pips below the 20-day low at 0.7850 with a stop at 0.8032, or a few pips above\nthe two-day high of 0.8025. Our risk on the trade is 182 pips. When the currency\npair drops to 0.7668, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. The breakeven stop is triggered the very same day that the ﬁrst\ntarget is reached.\n139CHAPTER 15\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Channels\nChannel trading is a less exotic but popular trading technique for currencies. The\nreason why it can work is because currencies rarely spend much time in tight\ntrading ranges and have the tendency to develop strong trends. By reviewing a few\ncharts, traders can see that channels can easily be identiﬁed and occur frequently.\nA common scenario would be channel trading during the Asian session and a\nbreakout in either the London or U.S. session. There are many instances where\neconomic releases are one of the most common triggers for a break of the channel.\nTherefore, it is imperative that traders keep on top of economic releases. If a channel\nhas formed and a big U.S. number (per say) is expected to be released, and the\ncurrency pair is at the top of a channel, the probability of a break is high, so traders\nshould be looking to buy the break out, not fade it.\nChannels are created when we draw a trendline, and then draw a line that is\nparallel to that trendline. Most if not all of the price activity of the currency pair\nshould fall between the two channel lines. We will seek to identify situations where\nthe price is trading within a narrow channel, and then trade in the direction of a\nbreakout from the channel. This strategy can be particularly effective when used\nprior to a fundamental market event such as the release of major economic news, or\nprior to the ‘‘open’’ of a major ﬁnancial market.\nHere are some rules for using this technique to ﬁnd long trades:\n1. First, identify a channel on either an intraday or daily chart. The price should\nbe contained within a narrow range.\n2. Enter long as the price breaks above the upper channel line by 10 pips.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS1403. Place a stop at the lower channel line.\n4. Exit the position when it moves by double the amount risked.\nThe short rules are the reverse.\n■Examples\nLet examine a few examples. The ﬁrst example is a USDCAD 15-minute chart\nshown in Figure 15.1. The total range of the channel is approximately 30 pips with\nthe low being 1.2028 and the high 1.2056. In accordance with our strategy, we\nplace entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at 1.2018 and 1.2066. The\norder to buy gets triggered ﬁrst, and almost immediately we place a stop order\nat the low of the channel or 1.2028, which means we are risking 38 pips on the\ntrade. USDCAD then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of double the range at\n1.2142. More conservative traders could exit half of the position when it moves by\nthe amount risked, or 38 pips, and trail the stop on the remainder of the position.\nThe next example shown in Figure 15.2 is a 15-minute chart of EURGBP. The\ntotal range between the two lines is 12 p ips with the low being 0.7148 and the high\n0.7160. In accordance with our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and\nbelow the channel at 0.7138 and 0.7170. The order to buy gets triggered ﬁrst and\nalmost immediately we place a stop at the low of the channel or 0.7160 for 10-pip\nrisk. EURGBP then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of 20 pips or double\nthe amount risked.\nFIGURE 15.1 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS141\nFIGURE 15.2 EURGBP 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 15.3 EURUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFigure 15.3 is a 15-minute chart of the EURUSD. The total range during this\nfour-hour period is 18 pips with a high of 1.1206 and a low of 1.1188. In accordance\nwith our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at\n1.1216 and 1.1178. The order to sell gets triggered ﬁrst and almost immediately,\nwe place a stop order at the channel high of 1.1206 for a risk of 28 pips. The\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS142EURUSD then proceeds to sell off signiﬁcantly but only makes it to a low of 1.1132\nbefore stopping us out a few days later. We chose to show this example because it\nexplains why the more conservative approach of exiting half of the position when it\nmoves by the amount risk is more desirable, even though it has worse risk reward.\nA move of 58 pips is sizable on an intraday basis and may be difﬁcult to achieve.\nWhenever the risk is greater than 20 pips, it may be more prudent to exit half and\ntrail the stop.\n143CHAPTER 16\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Perfect\nOrder\nAperfect order in moving averages is deﬁned as a set of moving averages that\nis in sequential order. For an uptrend, a perfect order would be a situation\nin which the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) is at a higher price level than\nthe 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 50-day SMA. Meanwhile, the 100-day\nSMA would be below the 50-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA would be below\nthe 100-day SMA. In a downtrend, the opposite is true, where the 200-day SMA is\nat the highest level and the 10-day SMA is at the lowest level. Having the moving\naverages stacked up in sequential order are generally a strong indicator of a trending\nenvironment. Not only does it indicate that the momentum is on the side of trend,\nbut the moving averages also serve as multiple levels of support. To optimize the\nperfect order strategy, traders should also look for ADX to be greater than 20 and\ntrending upward. This represents a strong trend. Entry and exit levels are difﬁcult\nto determine with this strategy, but genera l l ys p e a k i n g ,w ew a n tt os t a yi nt h et r a d e\nfor as long as the perfect order remains in place and exit once the perfect order no\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER144longer holds. Perfect orders do not happen often, and the premise of this strategy is\nto capture the perfect order when it ﬁrst happens.\nThe perfect order seeks to take advantage of a trending environment near the\nbeginning of the trend:\n1. Look for a currency pair with moving averages in perfect order.\n2. Look for ADX pointing upwards, ideally greater than 20.\n3. Buy ﬁve candles after the initial formation of the perfect order (if it still\nholds).\n4. Initial stop is the low on the day of the initial crossover for longs and the high\nfor shorts.\n5. Exit the position when the perfect order no longer holds.\n■Examples\nFigure 16.1 is a daily chart of the EURUSD. In August 2014, the moving averages\nin the EURUSD formed a sequential perfect order. We check and see that ADX is\ngreater than 20, and we look to enter into a short trade ﬁve candles after the initial\nformation at 1.3390. Our initial stop is placed at the August 8 high of 1.3432. The\npair continues to move lower in the days and weeks that follow, and we remain in\nthe trade until the moving averages are no longer in perfect and the 10-day SMA\nmoves above the 20-day SMA, which occurs on October 17 when EURUSD settles\nthe day at 1.2758. The total proﬁt on this trade is 632 pips. We risked 42 pips on\nthe trade.\nThe next example is USDSGD. In Figure 16.2, the perfect order forms on\nNovember 6. We check and see that ADX is greater than 20, and we look to enter\ninto a long trade ﬁve candles after the initial formation at 1.2916. Our stop should\nbe at the November 6 low of 1.2911 but that is below our entry price so we put\nour stop at the 20-day SMA of 1.2822. The pair continues to move higher in the\nmonths that follow, and we remain in the trade until the moving averages are no\nlonger in perfect and the 10-day SMA moves below the 20-day SMA, which occurs\non March 27, when USD/SGD closes the day at 1.3685. The total move on this\ntrade is 770 pips for a risk of 89 pips.\nFigure 16.3 shows a perfect-order formation on a daily chart in USDJPY. The\nperfect order formed in October and when that occurred, we entered the trade\nﬁve days afterward at 116.20. Our stop was placed at 108.75, and we remained in\nthe trade until the 10-day SMA crossed below the 20-day SMA on December 19 at\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk145\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.1 EURUSD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk146\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.2 USDSGD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk147\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.3 USDJPY Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER148119.45. In this example, the proﬁt was 425 pips for a risk of 645 pips, which was\nfar from ideal.\nThe perfect order is a strategy that can be high proﬁt but low probability and\nlow frequency. This means there could be numerous stop outs before a long trend\nemerges. Also, when the currency pair moves more than 250 to 300 pips in proﬁt,\nyou may want to consider taking proﬁt on part of the positions.\n149CHAPTER 17\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nPairing Strong with\nWeak\nOne of the best ways to approach currency trading on a fundamental basis\nis to pair the strongest currency with the weakest. Of course ﬁnding that\npairing is rarely simple because it is not just about which countries are the strongest\nor weakest right now but instead which ones will become strong or weak going\nforward. Finding these currencies can also be challenging because we live in a global\neconomy where the health of one major economy will affect the outlook of another.\nYet buying a weak currency and selling a strong one unknowingly can be a big\nmistake that translates into large losses, so it is extremely important for forex traders\nto learn how to pair strong with weak to maximize returns. After doing so you can\nuse technical analysis to help identify points of entry in the direction of the trend.\nIn 2015, for example, the European Central Bank introduced quantitative easing\n(QE) as a last ditch effort to boost inﬂation and stimulate growth. We know that\nQE lowers interest rates and erodes the value of a currency but selling euros blindly\non March 9, 2015, when the central bank started buying bonds for the very ﬁrst\ntime, yielded only a short-lived decline in the currency. Instead it would have been\nsmarter to look for opportunities to sell the currency against a strong one on rallies.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK150\nFIGURE 17.1 EURGBP Daily Chart—Quantitative Easing\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 17.2 NZDCAD Daily Chart—Oil\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK151One good candidate at the time was the British pound, which was beneﬁting from\neconomic improvements and had a central bank that was moving closer to raising\nrates. Figure 17.1 shows how there was a lot of consolidation in EURGBP near\n74 cents prior to the launch of Eurozone quantitative easing. This level proved to\nbe resistance when the pair rallied in late March. Traders could have sold them,\nassuming that resistance would hold, or waited for the pair to revisit that level in\nApril and May.\nAnother way to pair strong with weak is to follow the direction of commodity\nprices. Oil prices bottomed at $43.46 in early 2015, having traded above $100 a\nbarrel only 8 months earlier and started to turn higher in March. As a major oil\nproducer, Canada would stand to beneﬁt from stabilization in crude prices. At the\ntime U.S. policy makers were talking about raising interest rates, the Australian\ndollar was beneﬁtting from improving domestic conditions, and sterling soared on\npositive data and a victory by the incumbent during the 2015 general election.\nSelling any of these currencies and buying the Canadian dollar would have been a\nrisky endeavor. Instead the best bet at th e time was to sell the New Zealand dollar\nand buy the Canadian dollar or the NZDCAD pair because New Zealand reported\nextremely weak labor data that prompted policy makers to talk about easing. As\nyou can see in Figure 17.2, NZDCAD started to turn lower just as oil prices moved\nhigher in March.\nFIGURE 17.3 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK152The best way to gauge strong versus weak is to monitor economic data surprises.\nWhile the ECB was buying bonds and implementing quantitative easing, Eurozone\ndata started to improve and U.S. data started to weaken. The market had not\nanticipated this shift in dynamic as they had been looking for weak Eurozone data to\nreinforce QE and stronger U.S. data to push the Fed to tighten. This unexpected\nchange drove EURUSD sharply higher, and buying breakouts in April and May as\nshown in Figure 17.3 would have been good bets.\n153CHAPTER 18\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nThe Leveraged\nCarry Trade\nThe leverage carry trade strategy is the quintessential global macro trade that\nhas long been one of the favorite strategies of hedge funds and investment\nbanks. On its most fundamental level, the carry trade strategy involves buying\na high-yielding currency and funding it with the sale of a low-yielding currency.\nAggressive speculators will leave the trade unhedged with the hope that the high\nyielding currency will appreciate in value relative to the lower yielding currency,\nallowing them to earn the interest rate differential on top of the capital appreciation.\nMore conservative investors may choose to hedge the exchange rate component,\nearning only the interest rate differential. Although the differentials tend to be small,\nusually 1 to 3 percent if the position is leveraged 5 to 10 times, the proﬁts from\ninterest rates alone can be substantial. Of course it is important to remember that\nwhile leverage can magnify proﬁts, it can also exacerbate losses. Capital appreciation\ngenerally occurs when a number of traders identify proﬁt opportunities and pile into\nthe same trade, driving up the value of the currency pair.\nIn foreign exchange trading, the carry trade is a popular way to take advantage\nof the notion that money ﬂows in and out of different markets, driven by the law\nof supply and demand: with markets offering higher rates of return on investment\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE154attracting the most capital. Countries are no different—in the world of international\ncapital ﬂows, nations that offer the highest interest rates will generally attract more\ninvestment creating greater demand for their currencies. This helps to fuel the\ncarry trade. The carry trade strategy is simple to master, but like all strategies,\nit contains risk. Carry trades perf ormed extremely well between 2000 and 2007,\nfailed miserably between 2008 and 2009, and recovered between late 2012 into\n2015. The chance of loss can be great if you do not understand how, why, and when\ncarry trades work best.\n■How Do Carry Trades Work?\nTo understand carry trading, it is important to ﬁrst understand that currencies are\nalways traded in pairs, so taking a carry trade involves buying a currency that offers\na high interest rate and simultaneously selling a currency that offers a low interest\nrate. Carry trades are proﬁtable when the exchange rate remains unchanged in\nvalue and investors are able to earn the d ifference in interes t—or spread—between\nthe two currencies, or when it appreciates in value, allowing the investor to earn\nthe spread along with capital appreciation. If the exchange rate falls by more than\nthe spread on the interest rate, it becomes a net loss for the investor.\nLet’s take a look at an example: Assume that the Australian dollar offers an\ninterest rate of 4.75%, while the Swiss franc offers an interest rate of 0.25%. To\nexecute the carry trade, an investor buys the Australian dollar and sells the Swiss\nfranc. In doing so, he or she can earn a proﬁt of 4.50% (2.75% in interest earned\nminus 0.25% in interest paid), as long as the exchange rate between Australian\ndollars and Swiss francs do not change. Figure 18.1 shows exactly how an investor\nwould execute the carry trade.\nLong Short\nBuy AUD\n4.75%Sell CHF\n0.25%Investor\nReceives: 4.75% from long AUD\nposition\nPays: 0.25% through short USD\nfunding position\nProfit: 4.50% in interest rate\nspread, assuming spot rate is \nconstantEnters long AUD/USD trade:\nFIGURE 18.1 Leveraged Carry Trade Example\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE155To summarize : A carry trade involves buying a currency that offers a high interest\nrate while selling a currency that offers a low interest rate.\n■Why Do Carry Trades Work?\nInterest rates are very important: Carry trades work because of the constant\nmovement of capital into and out of different countries in search of the highest yield.\nInterest rates are the main reason why some countries attract more investment\nthan others. There are three reasons why a country can pay a higher interest rate.\nFirst, if a country’s economy is doing well (high growth, high productivity, low\nunemployment, rising incomes, etc.), it will be able to offer those who invest in the\ncountry a higher rate of return. Second, central banks can raise interest rates on fast\ngrowing economies with rising inﬂation. Third, countries with high debt to GDP\nratios, low credit ratings, and/or inherent growth problems may also need to pay a\nhigher interest rate to attract investment.\nInvestors prefer to earn higher interest rates: Investors who are interested in\nmaximizing their proﬁts will naturally look for investments that offer them the\nhighest rate of return. When making a decision to invest in a particular currency, an\ninvestor is more likely to choose one that offers the highest rate of return, or in this\ncase, interest rate. If several investors make this exact same decision, the country\nwill experience an inﬂow of capital from those seeking to earn a high rate of return,\nand the currency should appreciate.\nWhat about countries that are not doing well economically? Countries that have\nlow growth and low productivity will not be able to offer investors a high rate of\nreturn unless they have a very poor credit rating and are forced to offer a higher\nrate to compensate for the risk of holding the country’s bond or currency. With\nmajor economies, however, there will be times where growth is so weak that\ninterest rates are brought to zero, providing investors with no meaningful return.\nThe difference between countries that offer h igh interest rates versus countries that\noffer low interest rates is what makes carry trades possible.\nLet’s take another look at the carry trade example above in more detail.\nImagine an investor in Switzerland who is earning an interest rate of 0.25% per\nyear on her bank deposit in Swiss francs. At the time, a bank in Australia is offering\n4.75% per year on a deposit of Australian dollars. Seeing that interest rates are much\nhigher with the Australian bank, this in vestor would like to ﬁnd a way to earn this\nhigher rate of interest on her money.\nNow imagine that the investor could somehow trade her deposit of Swiss francs\nby paying 0.25% for a deposit of Australian dollars paying 4.75%. What she has\neffectively done is to ‘‘sell’’ her Swiss franc deposit and use those funds to ‘‘buy’’ an\nAustralian dollar deposit. With this transaction, she now owns an Australian dollar\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE156Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.2 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 1\ndeposit that pays her 4.75% in interest per year, 4.50% more than she was earning\nwith her Swiss franc deposit.\nThis investor has essentially just done a carry trade by ‘‘buying’’ an Australian\ndollar deposit, and ‘‘selling’’ a Swiss franc deposit.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows out of\nSwitzerland and into Australia, as investors take their Swiss francs and convert them\ninto Australian dollars. Australia attracts more capital because of the higher rates it\noffers. This inﬂow of capital increases the value of the currency (see Figure 18.2).\nTo summarize : Carry trades are made possible by the differences in interest rates\nbetween countries. B ecause they prefer to ea rn higher interest ra tes, investors will\nlook to buy and hold high interest rate paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Work Best?\nThere will be times when carry trades work better than others. In fact, carry trades\nare the most proﬁtable when there is a very speciﬁc attitude toward risk.\n■How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take?\nThe moods of people in general change over time—sometimes they may feel more\ndaring and willing to take chances; other times they may be more timid and prone to\nconservativeness. Investors, as a group, are no different. Sometimes they are willing\nto make investments that involve a good amount of risk; other times they are more\nfearful of losses and look to invest in safer assets.\nIn ﬁnancial jargon, when investors as a whole are willing to take on risk, we\ncall this low risk aversion, which means they are in risk-seeking mode. Alternatively,\nwhen investors are drawn to more conservative investments and less willing to take\no nr i s k ,w ed e s c r i b et h e ma s risk-averse .\nCarry trades are the most proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion .T h i s\nnotion makes sense when you consider what a carry trade involves. Remember, a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE157carry trade involves buying a currency that pays a high interest rate while selling a\ncurrency that pays a low interest rate. In buying the high interest rate currency, the\ninvestor is taking a risk because it is believed that a country needs to offer a higher\ninterest rate to offset the risk of holding th e currency. Also, while high interest rates\nattract investment, they can also hurt growth by raising the cost of borrowing. This\ncreates uncertainty around whether the economy of the country will continue to\nperform well and be able to pay not just high but even higher interest rates. This\nrisk is something a carry trade investor must be willing to take.\nIf investors as a whole were not willing to take on this risk, then capital would\nnever move from one country to another, and the carry trade opportunity would\nnot exist. Therefore, in order to return, carry trades require that investors as a\ngroup have low risk aversion, or be willing to bear the risk of investing in the higher\ninterest rate currency.\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the most proﬁtable when investors are willing\nto bear the risk of investing in high interest paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Not Work?\nSo far, we have shown that a carry trade will work best when investors have low\nrisk aversion. What happens when investors have high risk aversion ?\nCarry trades are the least proﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion .W h e n\ninvestors have high risk aversion, they are less willing as a group to take chances\nwith their investments. This means they would be less willing to invest in riskier\ncurrencies that offer higher interest rates. Instead, when investors have high risk\naversion they would actually prefer to put their money in ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies\nthat pay lower interest rates. During this time, they may also opt to close or unwind\ntheir carry trades. In doing so, they would be buying the currency with the low\ninterest rate and selling the curre ncy with the high interest rate.\nReturning to our earlier example, let’s assume the investor suddenly feels\nuncomfortable holding the foreign currency, the Australian dollar. Now, instead of\nlooking for the higher interest rate, she is more interested in keeping her investment\nsafe. As a result, she swaps her Australian dollars for more familiar Swiss francs.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows\nout of Australia and into Switzerland as investors take their Australian dollars and\nconvert them into Swiss francs. During this period of risk aversion, Switzerland\nattracts more capital due to the perceived safety of its currency, and the inﬂow of\ncapital increases the value of the Swiss franc (see Figure18.3).\nWhen investors have high risk aversion, they prefer to avoid the riskier high\ninterest rate paying currency and instea d invest in the safer, lower interest rate\npaying currency, which is the opposite of a carry trade.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE158Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.3 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 2\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the least proﬁtable in periods of uncertainty\nwhen investors are unwilling to bear the risk of investing in high interest paying\ncurrencies.\n■The Importance of Risk Aversion\nCarry trades will generally be proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion, and\nunproﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion. So before placing a carry trade\nit is important to understand the risk environment—whether investors as a whole\nhave high or low risk aversion—and when it changes .\nRising risk aversion is generally beneﬁcial for low interest rate paying currencies:\nSometimes the mood of investors will change rapidly, and investors’ willingness\nto make risky trades can change dramatically from one moment to the next.\nOften, these large shifts are caused by signiﬁcant global events. When periods\nof risk aversion occur quickly, the result is generally a large capital inﬂow into\nlow-interest-rate-paying ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies (see Figure 18.2).\nFor example, in the summer of 1998 the Japanese yen appreciated against the\ndollar by more than 20% over the span of two months, due to the Russian debt\ncrisis and LTCM hedge fund bailout. Similarly, just after the September 11 terrorist\nattacks the Swiss franc rose by more than 7% against the dollar over a 10-day period.\nDuring the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, we also saw big gains in the yen and the\nSwiss franc.\nThese sharp movements in currency values often occur when risk aversion quickly\nchanges from low to high. As a result, when risk aversion shifts, a carry trade can\nturn from being proﬁtable to unproﬁtable very quickly.\nRisk Aversion and Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nAs investor risk aversion goes from high to low, carry trades become more proﬁtable\nas detailed in Figure 18.4.\nHow do you know if investors as a whole have high or low risk aversion?\nUnfortunately, it is difﬁcult to measure investor risk aversion with a single number.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE1591 .

Low-interest currencies\ntend to remain weak, used in \nfinancing risky trades(–)( +)\nFIGURE 18.4 Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nOne way to get a broad idea of risk aversion levels is to look at bond yields. The\nwider the spread between the yields of bonds from different countries with similar\ncredit ratings, the higher the investor risk aversion. Bond yields are readily available\non major ﬁnancial websites such as Bloomberg.com and Reuters.com. In addition,\nseveral large banks have developed their own measures of risk aversion that signal\nwhen investors are willing to take risk and when they are not.\nOther Things to Bear in Mind When Considering a Carry Trade\nWhile risk aversion is one of the most important things to consider before making\na carry trade, it is not the only one. The following are some additional issues to be\naware of.\nLow Interest Rate Currency Appreciation\nBy entering into a carry trade, an investor is able to earn a proﬁt from the interest\nrate difference, or spread, between a high interest rate currency and a low interest\nrate currency. However, the carry trade can turn unproﬁtable if for some reason\n(like the risk aversion examples earlier), the low interest rate currency appreciates\nby a signiﬁcant amount.\nAside from rising risk aversion, improving economic conditions within a low\ninterest paying country can also cause its currency to appreciate. An ideal carry trade\nwill involve a low interest currency whose economy is weak and has low expectations\nfor growth. If the economy were to improve, however, the country might then be\nable to offer investors a higher rate of return through increased interest rates. If this\nwere to occur—again, using the previous example, say that Switzerland increased\nthe interest rates it offered—then investors may take advantage of these higher rates\nby investing in Swiss francs. As seen in Figure 18.3, an appreciation of the Swiss franc\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE160would negatively affect the proﬁtability of the Australian dollar–Swiss franc carry\ntrade. (At the very least, higher interest rates in Switzerland would negatively affect\nthe carry trade’s proﬁtability by lowering the interest rate spread.)\nThis same sequence of events may currently be unfolding for the Japanese yen.\nGiven its zero interest rates, the Jap anese yen has for a very long time been an\nideal low interest rate currency to use in carry trades (known as yen carry trades ).\nThis situation however, may be changing. Increased optimism about the Japanese\neconomy has recently led to an increase in the Japanese stock market. Increased\ninvestor demand for Japanese stocks and currency has caused the yen to appreciate,\nand this yen appreciation negatively affects the proﬁtability of carry trades like\nAustralian dollar (high interest rate) versus Japanese yen.\nIf investors continue to buy the yen, the yen carry trade could start to become\nunproﬁtable. This further illustrates the fact that when the low interest rate currency\nin a carry trade (the currency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the\nproﬁtability of the overall carry trade position.\nTrade Balances\nA country’s trade balance (the differen ce between imports and exports) can also\naffect the proﬁtability of a carry trade. We know that when investors have low\nrisk aversion or are risk seeking, capital will ﬂow from the low interest rate paying\ncurrency to the high interest rate paying currency (see Figure 18.2) but this does\nnot always happen.\nOne reason is because countries with large trade surplus can still see their\ncurrencies appreciate in low risk environments because running a trade surplus\nmeans that the country exports more than it imports. This creates naturally demand\nfor the currency.\nThe point of this example is to show that even when investors have low risk\naversion, large trade imbalances can cause a low interest rate currency to appreciate\n(as in Figure 18.3). And when the low interest rate currency in a carry trade (the\ncurrency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the proﬁtability of the carry\ntrade.\nTime Horizon\nIn general, a carry trade is a long-term strategy. Before entering into a carry trade,\nan investor should be willing to commit to a time-horizon of at least six months. This\ncommitment helps to make sure that the trade will not be affected by the ‘‘noise’’\nof shorter-term currency price movements.\nTo summarize : Carry trade investors should be aware of factors such as currency\nappreciation, trade balances, and time horizon before placing a trade. Any or all of\nthese factors can cause a seemingly proﬁtable carry trade to become unproﬁtable.\n161CHAPTER 19\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nMacro Event Driven\nTrade\nShort-term traders are generally focused only on the economic release of the\nweek and how it will impact their day trading activities. This works well for\nmany traders, but it is also important not to lose sight of the big macro events\nthat may be brewing in the economy or the world for that matter. Large-scale\nmacroeconomic events will move markets and will move them in very big ways.\nTheir impact goes beyond a simple one- or two-day price change because depending\non their size and scope, these occurrences have the potential to reshape the\nfundamental perception toward a currency for months or even years at a time.\nEvents such as wars, political uncertainly, natural disasters, and major international\nmeetings or monetary policy changes are so potent due to their irregularity that they\ncan have widespread psychological and physical impacts on the currency market.\nWith these events come both currencies that appreciate vastly and currencies that\ndepreciate just as dramatically. Therefore, keeping on top of global developments,\nunderstanding the underlying direction of market sentiment before and after these\nevents occur and anticipating them could be very proﬁtable, or at least can help\nprevent signiﬁcant losses.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE162■Know When Big Events Occur: Here Is a List\nof a Few Important Ones\n■Signiﬁcant G7 ﬁnance ministers meetings\n■Presidential elections\n■Important summits\n■Major Central Bank meetings\n■Potential changes to currency regimes\n■Possible debt defaults by large countries\n■Possible wars as a result of rising geopolitical tensions\n■Federal Reserve chairman’s semiannual testimony on economy\nThe best way to highlight the signiﬁcance of these events is look at a few notable\nmacroeconomic examples from the past two decades.\n2014 Ukraine–Russia Crisis\nThe 2014 Ukraine–Russia crisis was one of the biggest geopolitical events of the\npast decade. The crisis began in 2013 but didn’t really hit its peak until March\n2014 when Russia signed a bill to absorb Crimea. Leading up to the announcement,\nthe uncertainty put signiﬁcant pressure on the EURUSD in January 2014 with the\ncurrency pair dropping sharply on March 18, 2014, the day that Russia declared that\nCrimea was now ofﬁcially apart of their country. This led to a few more weeks of\ndownward pressure for the EURUSD as shown in Figure 19.1 as investors awaited\nthe world’s response. Many nations declared their support for Ukraine and war was\nfeared, but eventually Russia was only hit with sanctions, and a few months later,\nthe Ukraine crisis moved to the back burner.\nEuropean Sovereign Debt Crisis (2009–2013)\nThe European Sovereign Debt Crisis started in 2009 and lasted into 2013 with the bulk\nof the damage being done by February 2012. It was a multiyear debt crisis that was\nsparked by the inability of many member nations to meet their debt obligations after\nthe global ﬁnancial crisis. Their banking sectors and economies suffered signiﬁcant\nlosses, and persistently negative growth prospects made it impossible for countries\nsuch as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus to repay or reﬁnance their government\ndebt. Between 2010 and 2012, all of these na tions required bailouts or some form\nof support from the Troika, composed of the ECB, IMF and European Commission.\nWhile the problems were concentrated in smaller Eurozone nations, there was fear\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE163\nFIGURE 19.1 EURUSD Ukraine Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE164\nFIGURE 19.2 EURUSD Sovereign Debt Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nof contagion for the major economies. The country of Spain did not require a bailout\nbut in 2012, a number of banks required additional funding. The crisis posed caused\nsigniﬁcant volatility for the euro. Figure 19.2 shows two long periods of EURUSD\nweakness that were caused by bailouts, downgrades, and other negative headlines.\nGlobal Financial Crisis (2007–2009), Subprime\nOne of the most important macroeconomic events of the twenty-ﬁrst century was\nthe 2007 to 2009 subprime/global ﬁnancial crisis. It was triggered by a sharp slide\nin house prices, default on mortgages, and blowup of subprime mortgage backed\nsecurities and collateralized debt obligations. This, in turn, caused massive losses for\nbanks and ﬁnancial institutions, leading the failure of major ﬁrms such as Lehman\nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns. The impact on the ﬁnancial market and\nthe economy was staggering, with many countries falling into recession. During this\nperiod, the stock market lost more than 50% of its value with the S&P 500, falling\nfrom a high of 1,565 in October 2007 to a low of 676 in March 2009. As shown in\nFigure 19.3, USDJPY dropped from a high of 116.47 in October 2007 to a low of\n87.13 in January 2009. This was only the beginning of a multiyear decline for the\ncurrency pair. EURUSD had a delayed reaction, rallying strongly between October\n2007 and April 2008 as money ﬂowed out of the U.S. economy, and then falling\nsharply between July 2008 and October 2008 as the risk aversion and crisis spread\nto Europe.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE165\nFIGURE 19.3 USDJPY Global Financial Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nPolitical Uncertainty: 2004 U.S. Presidential Election\nAnother example of major events impacting the currency market is the 2004 U.S.\npresidential elections. In general, political instability causes perceived weakness\nin currencies. The hotly contested presidential election in November of 2004,\ncombined with the differences in the candidates’ stance on the growing budget\ndeﬁcit, resulted in overall dollar bearishness. The sentiment was exacerbated even\nfurther, given the lack of international support for the incumbent President (Bush)\ndue to the administration’s decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein. As a result, in\nthe three weeks leading up to the election, the euro rose 600 pips against the U.S.\ndollar. This can be seen in Figure 19.4. With a Bush victory becoming increasingly\nclear and later conﬁrmed, the dollar sold off against the majors as the market looked\nahead to what would probably end up being the maintenance of status quo. On the\nday following the election, the EURUSD rose another 200 pips and then continued\nto rise an additional 700 pips before peaking out six weeks later. This entire move\ntook place over the course of two months, which may seem like an eternity for\nmany, but this macroeconomic event really shaped the markets and for those who\nwere following it, big proﬁts could have been made. However, this is important\neven for short-term traders because given that the market was bearish dollars in\ngeneral leading up to the U.S. presidential election, a more prudent trade would be\nto look for opportunities to buy the EURUSD on dips rather than trying sell rallies\nand look for tops.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE166\nPost Election -\nAnother 700\nPip Rally \n600 Pip Rally\nPre Election\n2004 Election\nNight\nFIGURE 19.4 EURUSD Election Trade\nSource: eSignal\nG7 Meeting Dubai September 2003\nThe G7 ﬁnance ministers meeting on September 22, 2003, was a very important\nturning point for the markets. The dollar collapsed signiﬁcantly following the meeting\nat which the G7 ﬁnance ministers wanted to see ‘‘more ﬂexibility in exchange rates.’’\nDespite the rather tame nature of these words, the market interpreted this line to be\na major shift in policy. The last time changes to this degree had been made was back in\n2000. Taking a step back, the countries that constitute the G7 are the United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, and France. Collectively, these\ncountries account for two-thirds of the world’s total economic output. Not all G7\nmeetings are important. The only time the market really hones in on the G7 ﬁnance\nministers meeting is when they expect big changes to be made to the statement. In\n2000, the market paid particular attention to the upcoming meeting because there\nwas strong intervention in the EURUSD the day before the meeting. The meeting\nin September 2003 was also important because the U.S. trade deﬁcit was ballooning\nand becoming a huge issue. The EURUSD bore the brunt of the dollar depreciation\nwhile Japan and China were intervening aggressively in their currencies. As a result,\nit was widely expected that the G7 ﬁnance ministers as a whole would issue a\nstatement that was highly critical of Japan and China’s intervention policies. Leading\nup to the meeting, the U.S. dollar had alre ady begun to sell off as indicated by the\nchart. At the time of the announcement, the EURUSD shot up 150 pips. Though\nthis initial move was not ve ry substantial, between Se ptember 2003 and February\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE167\n6% Rally\n14% Rally\nSept 22, 2003\nG7 Meeting\nFIGURE 19.5 EURUSD G7 Meeting\nSource: eSignal\n2004 (which was the next G7 meeting), the dollar fell 8% on a trade-weighted\nbasis, 9% against the British pound, 11% against the euro, 7% against the yen,\nand 1.5% against the Canadian dollar. To put the percentages into perspective, a\nmove of 11% is equivalent to approximately 1100 pips. Therefore, the longer-term\nimpact is much more signiﬁcant than the immediate impact as the event itself has the\nsigniﬁcance to change the overall sentiment in the market. Figure 19.5 is a weekly\nchart of the EURUSD that illustrates how the currency pair performed following\nthe September 22, 2003 G7 meeting.\nU.S. War Against Iraq\nGeopolitical risks such as wars can also have a pronounced impact on the currency\nmarket. Figure 19.6 shows that bet ween December 2002 and February 2003, the\ndollar depreciated 9% against the Swiss franc (USDCHF) in the months leading up\nto war. The dollar sold off because the war itself was incredibly unpopular among\nthe international community. The Swiss franc was one of the primary beneﬁciaries\ndue to the country’s political neutrality an d safe-haven status. Between February\nand March, traders began to believe that the inevitable war would turn into a quick\nand decisive U.S. victory, so they began to unwind the war trade. This eventually\nled to a 3% rally in USDCHF as investors exited their short dollar positions.\nEach of these events caused large-scale movements in the currency market. Such\nevents are clearly important to follow for all types of traders. Keeping abreast of\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE168\nFIGURE 19.6 USDCHF Iraq War\nSource: eSignal\nbroad macroeconomic events can help traders make smarter decisions and prevent\nthem from fading large factors that may be brewing in the background. Most of\nthese events are talked about, debated, and anticipated many months in advance by\neconomists, currency analysts, and the international community in general.\n169CHAPTER 20\nQuantitative Easing\nand Its Impact on\nForex\nQuantitative easing is such an important topic that it deserves its own chapter.\nAfter the global ﬁnancial crisis many countries fell into recession, and in\nresponse central banks around the world lowered interest rates to record lows.\nWhen rates could not fall any lower, they had to resort to unprecedented measures,\nthe most powerful of which was quantit ative easing (QE). Between 2007 and 2015,\nthe Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and\nthe Swedish National Bank all resorted to QE, and their decision had a signiﬁcant\nimpact on their currencies on both a short- and long-term basis.\nThe goal of quantitative easing is to keep yields low and to ﬂood the market\nwith liquidity. To do so, a central bank would create money by buying ﬁnancial\nassets such as government bonds from banks using electronic cash. This basically\n‘‘creates new money.’’ It also keeps yields low because bond prices have an inverse\nrelationship with yields and in giving banks money, the hope is that it will encourage\nlending and in turn lead to more economic activity. The jury is out on how\nmuch QE really helped these economies, but the inﬂuence on currencies was\nundeniable.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX170■U.S. Quantitative Easing\nAfter the ﬁnancial crisis, the ﬁrst major central bank to respond with quantitative\neasing was the U.S. Federal Reserve. In November 2008, the central bank launched\na $600 billion bond-buying program. The program was initially effective as the\neconomy improved, prompting the Fed to temporarily halt bond purchases.\nHowever, the economy never gained additional momentum and as such, the central\nbank returned with a second round of QE (dubbed QE2) in November 2010. The\nsize of the program matched the ﬁrst round. Unfortunately, more bond buys were\nneeded, and QE3 was launched in September 2012. Unlike QE1 and QE2, QE3\nwas an open-ended program. The central bank announced plans to purchase $40\nbillion in assets every month, and in December 2012, that amount was increased\nto $85 billion per month. The program lasted for ﬁve years, and purchases were\nﬁnally halted in October 2014. Figure 20.1 shows how each round of quantitative\neasing impacted the EURUSD. As you can see, each round triggered a sharp rise in\nEURUSD and—another way to look at it—weakness in the U.S. dollar. In 2008,\nthe month that QE1 was announced, EURUSD surged 17% from high to low.\nWhen QE2 was announced, the EURUSD began a rally that took the pair up more\nthan 20%. QE3 led to a similar uptrend with gains extended when the program\nwas increased.\n■UK Quantitative Easing\nQuantitative easing was launched by the Bank of England in March 2009. At the\ntime, the BoE pledged to spend 75 billion pounds over a three-month period buying\nUK assets, but the program continue d and between March 2009 and January 2010,\nthe central bank had spent 200 billion pounds. In October 2011, growth started to\nslow more dramatically with the economy facing a double dip recession. In response\npolicymakers voted to increase the QE program by another 75 billion. In February\n2012, the central bank added another 50 billion and the same increase was made in\nJuly 2012, bringing the total program to 375 billion pounds. Figure 20.2 shows how\nGBPUSD responded to each round of QE. What is interesting is that the sterling\nfell sharply in the run up to the March 2009 announcement. It extended lower\nafterward but rebounded in the months that followed. In 2011, 2012, and 2013,\nthe sterling rallied the month that QE was announced. One important thing to\nremember is that the Federal Reserve was also buying bonds and expanding its own\nQE program at the time, so the two offset each other to some degree, limiting the\nreaction in GBPUSD. More importantly, investors interpreted each round of BoE\nQE as positive for the currency because they hoped that the central bank’s efforts\nwould help to turn around the economy.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk171\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.1 EURUSD US Fed QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk172\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.2 GBPUSD UK BoE QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk173\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.3 USDJPY Japan BoJ QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk174\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.4 EURUSD EZ ECB QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX175■Japan Quantitative Easing\nThe phrase quantitative easing was ﬁrst used by the Bank of Japan in 2001. At the time,\nthey did not believe that the program was effective but after the ﬁnancial crisis, they\nsaid they would examine their asset purchase program. In October 2011 the Bank of\nJapan increased the program by 5 trillion yen which was a small sum (approximately\nUSD$66 billion) compared to the staggering amounts that other countries were\npurchasing. Then in April 2013, they announced a bold and aggressive plan to\nbuy 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen a year as part of Prime Minister Abe’s economic\npolicies. This program was later expanded to 80 billion yen a year. Unlike other\ncountries where the effectiveness of QE was debated, Japan’s bond buying program\nplayed a large role in turning around the economy. It also had a signiﬁcant impact\non the currency. In Figure 20.3 we show how the ﬁrst program yielded a very small\nresponse in USDJPY but when the Bank of Japan came out in size, USDJPY reacted\nquickly and aggressively with a move that extended even further when the program\nwas expanded.\n■Eurozone Quantitative Easing\nThe European Central Bank was the last major central bank to roll out quantitative\neasing. They were reluctant to do so for a very long time because structurally the\nEurozone is not set up for quantitative easing. Since there is no euro-bond, some\ncritics felt that it was not in line with the central bank’s mandate. However faced\nwith sluggish growth, stubbornly low inﬂation, and an interest rate already at zero,\nthe ECB had very few options. They publicly discussed the option months before the\nactual decision, giving the market plenty of opportunity to discount the move. In\nJanuary 2015, the ECB announced that they would spend 60 billion euros per month\nbuying private and public bonds. In March 2015, ECB President Draghi unveiled\nan aggressive 1 trillion quantitative easing program. As shown in Figure 20.4, both\nannouncements had a signiﬁcant impact on the currency, but EURUSD stabilized\nafter the second announcement (but only after falling 500 pips) because investors\nhoped that the aggressive program by the central bank would help turn around\nthe economy.\nWhile no additional quantitative easing programs are expected as of mid-2015,\nthe unwinding of these unprecedented measures in the coming years should have\njust as much impact on currencies as the initial announcement itself, providing an\nopportunity for forex traders."

        "187CHAPTER 23\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nRisk Reversals\nRisk reversals are a useful fundamental-based tool to add to your mix of trading\nindicators. One of the weaknesses of currency trading is the lack of volume data\nand accurate indicators for gauging sentiment. The only publicly available report\non positioning is the Commitment of Traders Report published by the Commodity and\nFutures Commission. Unfortunately, this report is released with a three-day delay.\nA useful alternative is to use risk reversals—which are provided on a real-time basis\non the FXCM News Plugin , under options, or on the Bl oomberg/Reuters terminals.\nAs we ﬁrst introduced in Chapter 7, a risk reversal consists of a pair of options\nfor the same currency (a call and a put). Based on put–call parity, these far out of\nthe money options (25 delta) with the same expiration and strike price should also\nhave the same implied volatility. However, in reality, this is not true. Sentiment is\nembedded in volatilities, which makes risk reversals a good tool to gauge market\nsentiment. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates that there is more\ndemand for calls than puts. The opposite is also true; a number strongly in favor of\nputs over calls indicates that there is a premium built in put options as a result of the\nhigher demand. If risk reversals are near zero, it indicates that there is indecision\namong bulls and bears and that there is no strong bias in the markets.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS1884/28–1 .50–1 .00–0.500.00RR %0.501. 0 01. 5 02.00\n7/7 3/290.910.99\n0.97\n0.95\n0.93\n0.89\n0.87\n0.85\n0.83\n0.81\n0.79\n0.77\nEURUSD\n0.75\n1/18 11/9RRs Spot\n8/31 6/22 4/13 2/2 11/24 9/15EURUSD and Risk Reversals\nFIGURE 23.1 EURUSD Risk Reversal Chart\n■What Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nWe showed this table before in Chapter 7, but want to present it again to make\nsure that it is understood well (see Figure 23.1). Each of the abbreviations for the\ncurrency options are listed; and as indicated, most risk reversals are near zero,\nwhich reﬂects no major bias for puts or calls.

A positive number indicates that calls\nare preferred over puts and that the market as a whole anticipates an upward\nmovement in the underlying currency. Likewise, a negative number indicates that\nputs are preferred over calls and that the market is expecting a down-move in the\nunderlying currency. Used prudently, risk reversals can be a valuable tool in judging\nmarket positioning. While the signals generated by a risk reversal system will not\nbe completely accurate, they can help investors judge whether the market is bullish\nor bearish.\nRisk reversals become particularly important when the values are at extreme\nlevels. We identify extreme levels as one standard deviation plus or minus the average\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS189risk reversal. When risk reversals are at these levels, they give off contrarian signals,\nindicating that a currency pair is overbought or oversold based upon sentiment.\nThe indicator is perceived as a contrarian signal because when the entire market\nis positioned for a rise in a given currency, it makes it harder for the currency to\nrally and easier for it to fall on negative news or events. As a result, a strongly\nnegative number implies oversold conditions whereas a strongly negative number\nwould imply overbought conditions. Although the buy or sell signals produced by\nrisk reversals are not perfect, they can convey additional information used to make\ntrading decisions.\nExamples\nTake a look at our ﬁrst example of the EURUSD (Figure 23.1). Visually, you can see\nthat 25 delta risk reversals have been a leading indicator for EURUSD price action.\nWhen risk reversals plunged to –1.39 o n September 30, it was a signal that the\nmarket had a strong bearish bias. This proved to be a reliable contrarian indicator\nof what eventually became a 300-pip rebound in the EURUSD over the course of\nnine days. When prices spiked once again almost immediately to 0.67 in favor of a\ncontinuation of the up move, the EURUSD proved bulls wrong by engaging in an\neven deeper selloff. Although there were many instances of risk reversals signaling\ncontra-trend moves on a smaller scale, the next major spike came a year later. On\nAugust 16, risk reversals were at 1.43, which meant that bullish sentiment hit a\nvery high level. This preceded a 260-pip drop in the EURUSD over the course of\nthree weeks. When risk reve rsals spiked once again a month later to 1.90, we saw\nanother top in the EURUSD, which later became a much deeper descent.\nGBP/USD\n1. 7 0\n1. 6 5\n1. 6 0\n1. 5 5\n1. 5 0\n1. 4 5\n1. 4 0\n1. 3 5\n1. 3 0\nNov-00 Apr-01 Oct-01 Mar-02 Sep-02 Feb-03 Aug-031. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.0\n–0.5\n–1 .0GBP/USD Sell\nBuy RR %RR %\nBuy\nFIGURE 23.2 GBPUSD Risk Reversal Chart\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS190The next example is the GBPUSD.

With the lack of price volume data\nto give us a sense of where the market is positioned, risk reversals can be helpful in\ngauging general market sentiment.\n191CHAPTER 24\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nUsing Option\nVolatilities to Time\nMarket Movements\nUsing option volatilities to time foreign exchange spot movement is a topic that\nwe touched on brieﬂy in Chapter 7. This strategy warrants a more detailed\nexplanation because it has long been a favorite for professional traders and hedge\nfunds. Volatility can be deﬁned as a measure of a currency’s expected ﬂuctuation\nover a given time period based on past price ﬂuctuations. This is typically calculated\nby taking the historic annual standard deviation of daily price changes. Future prices\nhelp to determine implied volatility, which is used to calculate option premiums.\nAlthough this sounds fairly complicated, its application is not. Basically, option\nvolatilities measure the rate and magnitude of a currency’s price over a given period\nof time based on historical ﬂuctuations. Therefore, if the average daily trading range\nof the EURUSD contracted from 100 pips to 60 pips and stayed there for two\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY192weeks, in all likelihood, short- term volatility also contra cted signiﬁcantly compared\nto longer-term volatility during the same time period.\n■How to Use Option Volatilities to Trade Forex\nAs a guideline, there are two simple rules to follow. The ﬁrst one is that if\nshort-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly lower than long-term volatilities, one\nshould expect a breakout, though the direction of the breakout will not be deﬁned\nby this rule. Lastly, if short-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than\nlong-term volatilities, one should expect a reversion to range trading.\nWhy Does This Technique Work?\nDuring a period of consolidation, implied option volatilities are either low or on\nthe decline. The inspiration for these rules is that in periods of range trading, there\ntends to be little movement. We care most about when option volatilities drop\nsharply, which could be a sign that a proﬁtable break is underway. When short-term\nvolatility is above long-term volatility, it means that near-term price action is more\nvolatile than the long-term average price action. This suggests that the ranges will\neventually contract back toward average levels. The trend is most noticeable in\nempirical data. Below are a few examples of how this rule predicted breakouts\nthat turned into new trends but before analyzing the charts, it is important to note\nthat we use one-month volatilities as our short-term volatilities and three-month\nvolatilities as our long-term volatilities.\nIn Figure 24.1, the one-month volatility of GBPUSD is generally close to three-\nmonth volatilities. However, the ﬁrst arrow shows an instance where short-term\nvolatility spiked above long-term volatility during a period of GBPUSD weakness.\nThis signaled a correction or relief rally in the currency pair and that was exactly\nwhat we saw in September when the GBPUSD bounced more than 200 pips. The\nsecond arrow shows an instance where short-term volatility spiked well below\nlong-term volatility and that foreshadowed a major breakdown in the currency pair.\nIn this case, GBPUSD dropped over 600 pips after a period of consolidation.\nIn Figure 24.2 we have a chart of USDJPY. Like GBPUSD, the one-month and\nthree-month option volatilities move very closely. However in May, one-month\nvolatilities dropped sharply below three-month volatilities and that foreshadowed\nthe ﬁrst breakout in more than two months.\nWho Can Beneﬁt from This Technique?\nThis strategy is not only useful for breakout traders, but range traders can also utilize\nthis information for their trading.

After eyeing a historical\nrange, traders should look at volatiliti es to estimate the likelihood that the spot\nprice will remain within this range. Should the trader decide to go long or short\nthis range, he or she should continue to monitor volatility as long as he or she has\nan open position in the pair to assist them in determining when to close out that\nposition. If short-term volatilities fall well below long-term volatilities, the trader\nshould consider closing their position if the suspected breakout is not in their favor.\nThe potential break is likely to work in the favor of the trader if the current spot\nis close to the limit and far from the stop. In this hypothetical situation, it may be\nproﬁtable to move limit prices away from current spot prices to increase proﬁts\nfrom the potential break. If the spot price is close to the stop price and far from the\nlimit price, the break is likely to work against the trader, and the trader should close\nhis or her position immediately.\nBreakout traders can monitor volatilities to verify a breakout. If traders suspect\na breakout, he or she can verify this breakout though implied volatilities. Should\nimplied volatility be constant or rising, there is a higher probability that the currency\nwill continue to trade in range than if vola tility is low or falling. In other words,\nbreakout traders should look for short-term volatilities to be signiﬁcantly lower than\nlong-term volatilities before making a breakout trade.\nAside from being a key component for pricing, option volatilities can also be\na useful tool for forecasting market activities. Option volatilities measure the rate\nand magnitude of the changes in a currency’ s prices. Implied option volatilities, on\nthe other hand, measure the expected ﬂuctuation of a currency’s price over a given\nperiod of time based on historical ﬂuctuations.\n■Tracking Volatilities on Your Own\nVolatility tracking typically involves taking the historic annual standard deviation of\ndaily price changes. Generally speaking, we use three-month volatilities for long-\nterm volatilities numbers and one-month volatilities for the short term. Volatilities\ncan be found on Bloomberg or Reuters.\nThe next step is to start compiling a list of data with the date, currency pair price,\nimplied one-month volatility, and implie d three-month volatility for the various\ncurrency pairs in Excel. It might also be beneﬁcial to ﬁnd the difference between the\none-month and three-month volatilities to look for large differentials or to calculate\none-month volatility as a percentage of three-month volatility.\nOnce a sufﬁcient amount of data is compiled, one can graph the data as a visual\naid. The graph should use two y-axes, with spot prices on one and short- and\nlong-term volatilities on the other. If desired, the differences in short- and long-term\nvolatilities can be graphed as well in a separate, single y-axis graph.\n195CHAPTER 25\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nIntervention\nIntervention by central banks is one of the most important short- and long-term\nfundamentally driven market movers for the currency market. For short-term\ntraders, intervention can lead to sharp intraday movements on the scale of 150–250\npips in a matter of minutes. For longer-term traders, intervention can signal a\nsigniﬁcant change in trend because it suggests that the central bank is shifting or\nsolidifying its stance and sending a message to the market that they are backing certain\ndirectional move in their currency. There are basically two types of intervention:\nsterilized and unsterilized. Sterilized intervention requires offsetting intervention\nwith the buying or selling of government bonds while unsterilized intervention\ninvolves no changes to the monetary base to offset intervention. Many argue that\nunsterilized intervention has a more lasting effect on the currency than sterilized\nintervention.\nTaking a look at some of the following case studies, it is apparent that interventions\nin general are important to watch and can have large impacts on a currency pair’s\nprice action. Although the actual timing of an intervention tends to be a surprise,\nquite often the market will begin talking about the need for intervention days or\nweeks before the actual intervention occurs. The direction of an intervention is\nalmost always known in advance because the central bank will typically come across\nthe newswires complaining about too much strength or weakness in their currency.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION196These warnings give traders a window of opportunity to participate in what could\nbe signiﬁcant proﬁt potentials or to stay out of the markets. The only thing to watch\nout for, which you will see in our case study is that the sharp intervention based\nrallies or selloffs can quickly be reversed as speculators come into the market to\n‘‘fade the central bank.’’ Whether or not the market fades, the central bank depends\non the frequency of central bank intervention, the success rate, the magnitude of\nthe intervention, the timing of the intervention, and whether fundamentals support\nintervention. Intervention is much more prevalent in emerging market currencies\nthan in the G7 currencies because these countries need to prevent their local\ncurrencies from appreciating too signiﬁcantly such that it would hinder economic\nrecovery and reduce the competitiveness of the country’s exports. Nonetheless, G7\ninterventions will happen and its rarity is exactly what makes them signiﬁcant.\n■Japan\nIn the past two decades, the central bank most willing to engage intervention is the\nBank of Japan. As an export dependent country, a strong yen poses a major risk to\nthe export sector. While the Bank of Japan conducts the intervention, the decision\nis made by the Ministry of Finance. The most recent case of intervention by the\nJapanese gover nment was in 2011. The BoJ largely s tayed out of the market between\n2012 and 2015 because Abenomics helped to drive a recovery in the economy. On\nOctober 31, 2011, USDJPY hit a record low, which means that the Japanese yen hit\na record high. Frustrated with the currency’s strength after the 2011 earthquake and\ntsunami, the Japanese government came into the forex market aggressively to sell\nthe yen and buy the dollar. On that day, their intervention efforts drove USDJPY\nfrom a low of 75.575 to a high of 79.50, almost 400 pips. As shown in Figure 25.1,\n90% of this move happened in the ﬁrst 35 minutes.\n75.0076.0077.0078.0079.0080.00\n14:00\n16:26\n17:56\n19:27\n21:01\n22:32\n0:03\n1:34\n3:09\n4:40\n6:11\n7:42\n9:29\n17:18\n1:24\n9:29\n17:37\n1:42\n9:48\n17:37\n2:01\n10:06USDJPY Oct 31, 2011\nFIGURE 25.1 USDJPY Chart\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION197The Bank of Japan also bought USDJPY in August 2011, but one of their biggest\nintervention programs was in March 2011, when central banks around the world\njoined the BoJ to sell the yen as a sign of solidarity after an earthquake and tsunami\ndrove the currency to a record high. On that day, intervention only drove USDJPY\nfrom 79.18 to 82, but a few weeks later it hit a high of 85.50, as shown in Figure 25.2.\nThe Bank of Japan also intervened in September 2015 and as shown in Figure 25.3,\na daily chart, USDJPY jumped nearly 300 pips that day. Typically, USDJPY will\nmove 75 to 150 pips on an average day, so a 300-pip move that happens in minutes\nis signiﬁcant. In all but one of these four cases, the intervention move was reversed\nalmost immediately. The only reason why USDJPY extended its rally in March 2011\nwas because the intervention was coordinated with other central banks, making it\nmore powerful.\nWhile the Japanese government has been quieter in recent years, they were\nvery active in the early twenty-ﬁrst cen tury. The frequency and strength of BoJ\nintervention during this period created an invisible ﬂoor under USDJPY. Although\nthere has been no more mention of this ﬂoor in recent years, the BoJ/MoF instilled\nenough fear that intervention is always a worry. This fear is well justiﬁed because in\nthe event of BoJ intervention, the average 100-pip daily range can easily triple.\nJapanese intervention can be traded one of two ways—ride the move on the\nday of intervention or fade it in the days that follow. The key is not to be greedy,\nbecause the Japanese government can always step in again. Committing to take a\nsolid 100-pip proﬁt (of a 150–200 pip move) or using a very short-term intraday\ntrailing stop of 15–20 pips, for example, can be helpful.\n■Switzerland\nThe Swiss National Bank’s 1.20 EURCHF ﬂoor is another form of intervention.\nFaced with a high level of uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued\ncurrency, and deﬂation risks in 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange\nrate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At the time, they pledged to sell francs in an unlimited\nquantity to maintain the peg. The goal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping\nthe gain in the franc. As shown in Figure 25.4, the peg was very effective in keeping\nEURCHF above 1.20 between late 2012 an d 2014. However, in January 2015, the\nprospect of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank pushed the SNB to\nabandon their peg, and their surprise announcement caused a 30% one-day decline\nin EURCHF. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\nOther central banks have also intervened in their currency in the past decade\nincluding the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Unfortunately, for the RBNZ, most\nof their efforts failed with the currency rising after each round of intervention.

They have only\nintervened a few times before, the most recent of which was in 2000. The ECB\ncame into the market to buy euros when the single currency dropped from 90 cents\nto 84 cents. In January 1999, when the euro was ﬁrst launched it was valued at\n1.17 against the U.S. dollar. Due to the sharp slide, the European Central Bank\n(ECB) convinced the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada to\njoin them in coordinated intervention to prop up the euro for the ﬁrst time ever.\nThe Eurozone felt concerned that the market was lacking conﬁdence in their new\ncurrency but also feared that the slide in their currency was increasing the cost of the\nregion’s oil imports. With energy prices hitting 10-year highs at the time, Europe’s\nheavy dependence on oil imports necessitated a stronger currency. The U.S. agreed\nto intervention because buying euros and selling dollars would help to boost the\nvalue of European imports and aid in the funding of an already growing U.S. trade\ndeﬁcit. Tokyo joined in the intervention because they were becoming concerned\nthat the weaker euro was posing a threat to their own exports. Although the ECB\ndid not release details on the magnitude of their intervention, the Federal Reserve\nreported having purchased 1.5 billion euros against the dollar on behalf of the ECB.\nEven though the actual intervention itse lf caught the market by surprise, the ECB\ngave good warning to the market with numerous bouts of verbal support from ECB\nand EU ofﬁcials. For trading purposes, this would have given traders an opportunity\nto buy euros in anticipation of intervention or to avoid shorting the EURUSD.\nFigure 25.5 shows the price action of the EURUSD on the day of intervention.\nUnfortunately, there is no minute data available dating back to September 2000,\nbut from the daily chart, we can see that on the day that the ECB intervened in the\neuro (September 22, 2000), with the help of its trade partners, the EURUSD had a\nhigh-low range of over 400 pips.\nEven though intervention does not happen often, it is a very important fundamental\ntrading strategy because each time it occurs, price movements are substantial.\nFor traders, intervention has three major implications for trading:\n1.Bet on intervention : Heed the warnings from central bank ofﬁcials and use it as\na signal for possible intervention—the invisible ﬂoor created by the Japanese\ngovernment gave USDJPY bulls plenty of opportunity to pick short-term\nbottoms.\n2.Avoid betting against intervention : Betting against intervention can be dangerous\nbecause one bout of intervention by a central bank could easily trigger a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION201EURUSD (September 2000)\n0.91\n0.90\n0.89\n0.88\n0.87\n0.86\n0.85\n0.84\n09/01/2000 09/03/2000 09/05/2000 09/07/2000 09/09/2000 09/11/2000 09/13/2000 09/15/2000 09/17/2000 09/19/2000 09/21/2000 09/23/2000 09/25/2000 09/27/2000 09/29/2000 10/01/2000 10/03/2000\nFIGURE 25.5 EURUSD Intervention\nsharp 100–150 plus pip move in the currency pair, taking out stop orders and\nexacerbating the move.\n3.Use stops when intervention is a risk : With the 24-hour nature of the market,\nintervention can occur at any time of the day.

        "187CHAPTER 23\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nRisk Reversals\nRisk reversals are a useful fundamental-based tool to add to your mix of trading\nindicators. One of the weaknesses of currency trading is the lack of volume data\nand accurate indicators for gauging sentiment. The only publicly available report\non positioning is the Commitment of Traders Report published by the Commodity and\nFutures Commission. Unfortunately, this report is released with a three-day delay.\nA useful alternative is to use risk reversals—which are provided on a real-time basis\non the FXCM News Plugin , under options, or on the Bl oomberg/Reuters terminals.\nAs we ﬁrst introduced in Chapter 7, a risk reversal consists of a pair of options\nfor the same currency (a call and a put). Based on put–call parity, these far out of\nthe money options (25 delta) with the same expiration and strike price should also\nhave the same implied volatility. However, in reality, this is not true. Sentiment is\nembedded in volatilities, which makes risk reversals a good tool to gauge market\nsentiment. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates that there is more\ndemand for calls than puts. The opposite is also true; a number strongly in favor of\nputs over calls indicates that there is a premium built in put options as a result of the\nhigher demand. If risk reversals are near zero, it indicates that there is indecision\namong bulls and bears and that there is no strong bias in the markets.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS1884/28–1 .50–1 .00–0.500.00RR %0.501. 0 01. 5 02.00\n7/7 3/290.910.99\n0.97\n0.95\n0.93\n0.89\n0.87\n0.85\n0.83\n0.81\n0.79\n0.77\nEURUSD\n0.75\n1/18 11/9RRs Spot\n8/31 6/22 4/13 2/2 11/24 9/15EURUSD and Risk Reversals\nFIGURE 23.1 EURUSD Risk Reversal Chart\n■What Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nWe showed this table before in Chapter 7, but want to present it again to make\nsure that it is understood well (see Figure 23.1). Each of the abbreviations for the\ncurrency options are listed; and as indicated, most risk reversals are near zero,\nwhich reﬂects no major bias for puts or calls.

When risk reversals are at these levels, they give off contrarian signals,\nindicating that a currency pair is overbought or oversold based upon sentiment.\nThe indicator is perceived as a contrarian signal because when the entire market\nis positioned for a rise in a given currency, it makes it harder for the currency to\nrally and easier for it to fall on negative news or events.

Basically, option\nvolatilities measure the rate and magnitude of a currency’s price over a given period\nof time based on historical ﬂuctuations. Therefore, if the average daily trading range\nof the EURUSD contracted from 100 pips to 60 pips and stayed there for two\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY192weeks, in all likelihood, short- term volatility also contra cted signiﬁcantly compared\nto longer-term volatility during the same time period.\n■How to Use Option Volatilities to Trade Forex\nAs a guideline, there are two simple rules to follow. The ﬁrst one is that if\nshort-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly lower than long-term volatilities, one\nshould expect a breakout, though the direction of the breakout will not be deﬁned\nby this rule. Lastly, if short-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than\nlong-term volatilities, one should expect a reversion to range trading.\nWhy Does This Technique Work?\nDuring a period of consolidation, implied option volatilities are either low or on\nthe decline. The inspiration for these rules is that in periods of range trading, there\ntends to be little movement. We care most about when option volatilities drop\nsharply, which could be a sign that a proﬁtable break is underway. When short-term\nvolatility is above long-term volatility, it means that near-term price action is more\nvolatile than the long-term average price action. This suggests that the ranges will\neventually contract back toward average levels. The trend is most noticeable in\nempirical data. Below are a few examples of how this rule predicted breakouts\nthat turned into new trends but before analyzing the charts, it is important to note\nthat we use one-month volatilities as our short-term volatilities and three-month\nvolatilities as our long-term volatilities.\nIn Figure 24.1, the one-month volatility of GBPUSD is generally close to three-\nmonth volatilities. However, the ﬁrst arrow shows an instance where short-term\nvolatility spiked above long-term volatility during a period of GBPUSD weakness.\nThis signaled a correction or relief rally in the currency pair and that was exactly\nwhat we saw in September when the GBPUSD bounced more than 200 pips. The\nsecond arrow shows an instance where short-term volatility spiked well below\nlong-term volatility and that foreshadowed a major breakdown in the currency pair.\nIn this case, GBPUSD dropped over 600 pips after a period of consolidation.\nIn Figure 24.2 we have a chart of USDJPY. Like GBPUSD, the one-month and\nthree-month option volatilities move very closely. However in May, one-month\nvolatilities dropped sharply below three-month volatilities and that foreshadowed\nthe ﬁrst breakout in more than two months.\nWho Can Beneﬁt from This Technique?\nThis strategy is not only useful for breakout traders, but range traders can also utilize\nthis information for their trading.

After eyeing a historical\nrange, traders should look at volatiliti es to estimate the likelihood that the spot\nprice will remain within this range. Should the trader decide to go long or short\nthis range, he or she should continue to monitor volatility as long as he or she has\nan open position in the pair to assist them in determining when to close out that\nposition. If short-term volatilities fall well below long-term volatilities, the trader\nshould consider closing their position if the suspected breakout is not in their favor.\nThe potential break is likely to work in the favor of the trader if the current spot\nis close to the limit and far from the stop. In this hypothetical situation, it may be\nproﬁtable to move limit prices away from current spot prices to increase proﬁts\nfrom the potential break. If the spot price is close to the stop price and far from the\nlimit price, the break is likely to work against the trader, and the trader should close\nhis or her position immediately.\nBreakout traders can monitor volatilities to verify a breakout. If traders suspect\na breakout, he or she can verify this breakout though implied volatilities. Should\nimplied volatility be constant or rising, there is a higher probability that the currency\nwill continue to trade in range than if vola tility is low or falling. In other words,\nbreakout traders should look for short-term volatilities to be signiﬁcantly lower than\nlong-term volatilities before making a breakout trade.\nAside from being a key component for pricing, option volatilities can also be\na useful tool for forecasting market activities. Option volatilities measure the rate\nand magnitude of the changes in a currency’ s prices. Implied option volatilities, on\nthe other hand, measure the expected ﬂuctuation of a currency’s price over a given\nperiod of time based on historical ﬂuctuations.\n■Tracking Volatilities on Your Own\nVolatility tracking typically involves taking the historic annual standard deviation of\ndaily price changes. Generally speaking, we use three-month volatilities for long-\nterm volatilities numbers and one-month volatilities for the short term. Volatilities\ncan be found on Bloomberg or Reuters.\nThe next step is to start compiling a list of data with the date, currency pair price,\nimplied one-month volatility, and implie d three-month volatility for the various\ncurrency pairs in Excel. It might also be beneﬁcial to ﬁnd the difference between the\none-month and three-month volatilities to look for large differentials or to calculate\none-month volatility as a percentage of three-month volatility.\nOnce a sufﬁcient amount of data is compiled, one can graph the data as a visual\naid. The graph should use two y-axes, with spot prices on one and short- and\nlong-term volatilities on the other. If desired, the differences in short- and long-term\nvolatilities can be graphed as well in a separate, single y-axis graph.\n195CHAPTER 25\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nIntervention\nIntervention by central banks is one of the most important short- and long-term\nfundamentally driven market movers for the currency market. For short-term\ntraders, intervention can lead to sharp intraday movements on the scale of 150–250\npips in a matter of minutes. For longer-term traders, intervention can signal a\nsigniﬁcant change in trend because it suggests that the central bank is shifting or\nsolidifying its stance and sending a message to the market that they are backing certain\ndirectional move in their currency. There are basically two types of intervention:\nsterilized and unsterilized. Sterilized intervention requires offsetting intervention\nwith the buying or selling of government bonds while unsterilized intervention\ninvolves no changes to the monetary base to offset intervention. Many argue that\nunsterilized intervention has a more lasting effect on the currency than sterilized\nintervention.\nTaking a look at some of the following case studies, it is apparent that interventions\nin general are important to watch and can have large impacts on a currency pair’s\nprice action. Although the actual timing of an intervention tends to be a surprise,\nquite often the market will begin talking about the need for intervention days or\nweeks before the actual intervention occurs. The direction of an intervention is\nalmost always known in advance because the central bank will typically come across\nthe newswires complaining about too much strength or weakness in their currency.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION196These warnings give traders a window of opportunity to participate in what could\nbe signiﬁcant proﬁt potentials or to stay out of the markets. The only thing to watch\nout for, which you will see in our case study is that the sharp intervention based\nrallies or selloffs can quickly be reversed as speculators come into the market to\n‘‘fade the central bank.’’ Whether or not the market fades, the central bank depends\non the frequency of central bank intervention, the success rate, the magnitude of\nthe intervention, the timing of the intervention, and whether fundamentals support\nintervention. Intervention is much more prevalent in emerging market currencies\nthan in the G7 currencies because these countries need to prevent their local\ncurrencies from appreciating too signiﬁcantly such that it would hinder economic\nrecovery and reduce the competitiveness of the country’s exports. Nonetheless, G7\ninterventions will happen and its rarity is exactly what makes them signiﬁcant.\n■Japan\nIn the past two decades, the central bank most willing to engage intervention is the\nBank of Japan. As an export dependent country, a strong yen poses a major risk to\nthe export sector. While the Bank of Japan conducts the intervention, the decision\nis made by the Ministry of Finance. The most recent case of intervention by the\nJapanese gover nment was in 2011. The BoJ largely s tayed out of the market between\n2012 and 2015 because Abenomics helped to drive a recovery in the economy. On\nOctober 31, 2011, USDJPY hit a record low, which means that the Japanese yen hit\na record high. Frustrated with the currency’s strength after the 2011 earthquake and\ntsunami, the Japanese government came into the forex market aggressively to sell\nthe yen and buy the dollar. On that day, their intervention efforts drove USDJPY\nfrom a low of 75.575 to a high of 79.50, almost 400 pips. As shown in Figure 25.1,\n90% of this move happened in the ﬁrst 35 minutes.\n75.0076.0077.0078.0079.0080.00\n14:00\n16:26\n17:56\n19:27\n21:01\n22:32\n0:03\n1:34\n3:09\n4:40\n6:11\n7:42\n9:29\n17:18\n1:24\n9:29\n17:37\n1:42\n9:48\n17:37\n2:01\n10:06USDJPY Oct 31, 2011\nFIGURE 25.1 USDJPY Chart\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION197The Bank of Japan also bought USDJPY in August 2011, but one of their biggest\nintervention programs was in March 2011, when central banks around the world\njoined the BoJ to sell the yen as a sign of solidarity after an earthquake and tsunami\ndrove the currency to a record high. On that day, intervention only drove USDJPY\nfrom 79.18 to 82, but a few weeks later it hit a high of 85.50, as shown in Figure 25.2.\nThe Bank of Japan also intervened in September 2015 and as shown in Figure 25.3,\na daily chart, USDJPY jumped nearly 300 pips that day. Typically, USDJPY will\nmove 75 to 150 pips on an average day, so a 300-pip move that happens in minutes\nis signiﬁcant. In all but one of these four cases, the intervention move was reversed\nalmost immediately. The only reason why USDJPY extended its rally in March 2011\nwas because the intervention was coordinated with other central banks, making it\nmore powerful.\nWhile the Japanese government has been quieter in recent years, they were\nvery active in the early twenty-ﬁrst cen tury. The frequency and strength of BoJ\nintervention during this period created an invisible ﬂoor under USDJPY. Although\nthere has been no more mention of this ﬂoor in recent years, the BoJ/MoF instilled\nenough fear that intervention is always a worry. This fear is well justiﬁed because in\nthe event of BoJ intervention, the average 100-pip daily range can easily triple.\nJapanese intervention can be traded one of two ways—ride the move on the\nday of intervention or fade it in the days that follow. The key is not to be greedy,\nbecause the Japanese government can always step in again. Committing to take a\nsolid 100-pip proﬁt (of a 150–200 pip move) or using a very short-term intraday\ntrailing stop of 15–20 pips, for example, can be helpful.\n■Switzerland\nThe Swiss National Bank’s 1.20 EURCHF ﬂoor is another form of intervention.\nFaced with a high level of uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued\ncurrency, and deﬂation risks in 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange\nrate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At the time, they pledged to sell francs in an unlimited\nquantity to maintain the peg. The goal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping\nthe gain in the franc. As shown in Figure 25.4, the peg was very effective in keeping\nEURCHF above 1.20 between late 2012 an d 2014. However, in January 2015, the\nprospect of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank pushed the SNB to\nabandon their peg, and their surprise announcement caused a 30% one-day decline\nin EURCHF. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\nOther central banks have also intervened in their currency in the past decade\nincluding the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Unfortunately, for the RBNZ, most\nof their efforts failed with the currency rising after each round of intervention.

They have only\nintervened a few times before, the most recent of which was in 2000. The ECB\ncame into the market to buy euros when the single currency dropped from 90 cents\nto 84 cents. In January 1999, when the euro was ﬁrst launched it was valued at\n1.17 against the U.S. dollar. Due to the sharp slide, the European Central Bank\n(ECB) convinced the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada to\njoin them in coordinated intervention to prop up the euro for the ﬁrst time ever.\nThe Eurozone felt concerned that the market was lacking conﬁdence in their new\ncurrency but also feared that the slide in their currency was increasing the cost of the\nregion’s oil imports. With energy prices hitting 10-year highs at the time, Europe’s\nheavy dependence on oil imports necessitated a stronger currency. The U.S. agreed\nto intervention because buying euros and selling dollars would help to boost the\nvalue of European imports and aid in the funding of an already growing U.S. trade\ndeﬁcit. Tokyo joined in the intervention because they were becoming concerned\nthat the weaker euro was posing a threat to their own exports. Although the ECB\ndid not release details on the magnitude of their intervention, the Federal Reserve\nreported having purchased 1.5 billion euros against the dollar on behalf of the ECB.\nEven though the actual intervention itse lf caught the market by surprise, the ECB\ngave good warning to the market with numerous bouts of verbal support from ECB\nand EU ofﬁcials. For trading purposes, this would have given traders an opportunity\nto buy euros in anticipation of intervention or to avoid shorting the EURUSD.\nFigure 25.5 shows the price action of the EURUSD on the day of intervention.\nUnfortunately, there is no minute data available dating back to September 2000,\nbut from the daily chart, we can see that on the day that the ECB intervened in the\neuro (September 22, 2000), with the help of its trade partners, the EURUSD had a\nhigh-low range of over 400 pips.\nEven though intervention does not happen often, it is a very important fundamental\ntrading strategy because each time it occurs, price movements are substantial.\nFor traders, intervention has three major implications for trading:\n1.Bet on intervention : Heed the warnings from central bank ofﬁcials and use it as\na signal for possible intervention—the invisible ﬂoor created by the Japanese\ngovernment gave USDJPY bulls plenty of opportunity to pick short-term\nbottoms.\n2.Avoid betting against intervention : Betting against intervention can be dangerous\nbecause one bout of intervention by a central bank could easily trigger a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION201EURUSD (September 2000)\n0.91\n0.90\n0.89\n0.88\n0.87\n0.86\n0.85\n0.84\n09/01/2000 09/03/2000 09/05/2000 09/07/2000 09/09/2000 09/11/2000 09/13/2000 09/15/2000 09/17/2000 09/19/2000 09/21/2000 09/23/2000 09/25/2000 09/27/2000 09/29/2000 10/01/2000 10/03/2000\nFIGURE 25.5 EURUSD Intervention\nsharp 100–150 plus pip move in the currency pair, taking out stop orders and\nexacerbating the move.\n3.Use stops when intervention is a risk : With the 24-hour nature of the market,\nintervention can occur at any time of the day.

        "187CHAPTER 23\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nRisk Reversals\nRisk reversals are a useful fundamental-based tool to add to your mix of trading\nindicators. One of the weaknesses of currency trading is the lack of volume data\nand accurate indicators for gauging sentiment. The only publicly available report\non positioning is the Commitment of Traders Report published by the Commodity and\nFutures Commission. Unfortunately, this report is released with a three-day delay.\nA useful alternative is to use risk reversals—which are provided on a real-time basis\non the FXCM News Plugin , under options, or on the Bl oomberg/Reuters terminals.\nAs we ﬁrst introduced in Chapter 7, a risk reversal consists of a pair of options\nfor the same currency (a call and a put). Based on put–call parity, these far out of\nthe money options (25 delta) with the same expiration and strike price should also\nhave the same implied volatility. However, in reality, this is not true. Sentiment is\nembedded in volatilities, which makes risk reversals a good tool to gauge market\nsentiment. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates that there is more\ndemand for calls than puts. The opposite is also true; a number strongly in favor of\nputs over calls indicates that there is a premium built in put options as a result of the\nhigher demand. If risk reversals are near zero, it indicates that there is indecision\namong bulls and bears and that there is no strong bias in the markets.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS1884/28–1 .50–1 .00–0.500.00RR %0.501. 0 01. 5 02.00\n7/7 3/290.910.99\n0.97\n0.95\n0.93\n0.89\n0.87\n0.85\n0.83\n0.81\n0.79\n0.77\nEURUSD\n0.75\n1/18 11/9RRs Spot\n8/31 6/22 4/13 2/2 11/24 9/15EURUSD and Risk Reversals\nFIGURE 23.1 EURUSD Risk Reversal Chart\n■What Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nWe showed this table before in Chapter 7, but want to present it again to make\nsure that it is understood well (see Figure 23.1). Each of the abbreviations for the\ncurrency options are listed; and as indicated, most risk reversals are near zero,\nwhich reﬂects no major bias for puts or calls. However, for USDJPY, the longer-\nterm risk reversals indicate that the market is strongly favoring yen calls (JC) and\ndollar puts.\n■How Can You Use This Information?\nFor easier graphing and tracking purposes, we use positive and negative integers\nfor calls and put premiums respectively. A positive number indicates that calls\nare preferred over puts and that the market as a whole anticipates an upward\nmovement in the underlying currency. Likewise, a negative number indicates that\nputs are preferred over calls and that the market is expecting a down-move in the\nunderlying currency. Used prudently, risk reversals can be a valuable tool in judging\nmarket positioning. While the signals generated by a risk reversal system will not\nbe completely accurate, they can help investors judge whether the market is bullish\nor bearish.\nRisk reversals become particularly important when the values are at extreme\nlevels. We identify extreme levels as one standard deviation plus or minus the average\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS189risk reversal. When risk reversals are at these levels, they give off contrarian signals,\nindicating that a currency pair is overbought or oversold based upon sentiment.\nThe indicator is perceived as a contrarian signal because when the entire market\nis positioned for a rise in a given currency, it makes it harder for the currency to\nrally and easier for it to fall on negative news or events. As a result, a strongly\nnegative number implies oversold conditions whereas a strongly negative number\nwould imply overbought conditions. Although the buy or sell signals produced by\nrisk reversals are not perfect, they can convey additional information used to make\ntrading decisions.\nExamples\nTake a look at our ﬁrst example of the EURUSD (Figure 23.1). Visually, you can see\nthat 25 delta risk reversals have been a leading indicator for EURUSD price action.\nWhen risk reversals plunged to –1.39 o n September 30, it was a signal that the\nmarket had a strong bearish bias. This proved to be a reliable contrarian indicator\nof what eventually became a 300-pip rebound in the EURUSD over the course of\nnine days. When prices spiked once again almost immediately to 0.67 in favor of a\ncontinuation of the up move, the EURUSD proved bulls wrong by engaging in an\neven deeper selloff. Although there were many instances of risk reversals signaling\ncontra-trend moves on a smaller scale, the next major spike came a year later. On\nAugust 16, risk reversals were at 1.43, which meant that bullish sentiment hit a\nvery high level. This preceded a 260-pip drop in the EURUSD over the course of\nthree weeks. When risk reve rsals spiked once again a month later to 1.90, we saw\nanother top in the EURUSD, which later became a much deeper descent.\nGBP/USD\n1. 7 0\n1. 6 5\n1. 6 0\n1. 5 5\n1. 5 0\n1. 4 5\n1. 4 0\n1. 3 5\n1. 3 0\nNov-00 Apr-01 Oct-01 Mar-02 Sep-02 Feb-03 Aug-031. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.0\n–0.5\n–1 .0GBP/USD Sell\nBuy RR %RR %\nBuy\nFIGURE 23.2 GBPUSD Risk Reversal Chart\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS190The next example is the GBPUSD. As can be seen in Figure 23.2, risk reversals\ndo a very good job of identifying extreme overbought and oversold conditions. Buy\nand sell levels are added to the GBPUSD chart for further clariﬁcation of how risk\nreversals can also be used to time market turns. With the lack of price volume data\nto give us a sense of where the market is positioned, risk reversals can be helpful in\ngauging general market sentiment.\n191CHAPTER 24\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nUsing Option\nVolatilities to Time\nMarket Movements\nUsing option volatilities to time foreign exchange spot movement is a topic that\nwe touched on brieﬂy in Chapter 7. This strategy warrants a more detailed\nexplanation because it has long been a favorite for professional traders and hedge\nfunds. Volatility can be deﬁned as a measure of a currency’s expected ﬂuctuation\nover a given time period based on past price ﬂuctuations. This is typically calculated\nby taking the historic annual standard deviation of daily price changes. Future prices\nhelp to determine implied volatility, which is used to calculate option premiums.\nAlthough this sounds fairly complicated, its application is not. Basically, option\nvolatilities measure the rate and magnitude of a currency’s price over a given period\nof time based on historical ﬂuctuations. Therefore, if the average daily trading range\nof the EURUSD contracted from 100 pips to 60 pips and stayed there for two\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY192weeks, in all likelihood, short- term volatility also contra cted signiﬁcantly compared\nto longer-term volatility during the same time period.\n■How to Use Option Volatilities to Trade Forex\nAs a guideline, there are two simple rules to follow. The ﬁrst one is that if\nshort-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly lower than long-term volatilities, one\nshould expect a breakout, though the direction of the breakout will not be deﬁned\nby this rule. Lastly, if short-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than\nlong-term volatilities, one should expect a reversion to range trading.\nWhy Does This Technique Work?\nDuring a period of consolidation, implied option volatilities are either low or on\nthe decline. The inspiration for these rules is that in periods of range trading, there\ntends to be little movement. We care most about when option volatilities drop\nsharply, which could be a sign that a proﬁtable break is underway. When short-term\nvolatility is above long-term volatility, it means that near-term price action is more\nvolatile than the long-term average price action. This suggests that the ranges will\neventually contract back toward average levels. The trend is most noticeable in\nempirical data. Below are a few examples of how this rule predicted breakouts\nthat turned into new trends but before analyzing the charts, it is important to note\nthat we use one-month volatilities as our short-term volatilities and three-month\nvolatilities as our long-term volatilities.\nIn Figure 24.1, the one-month volatility of GBPUSD is generally close to three-\nmonth volatilities. However, the ﬁrst arrow shows an instance where short-term\nvolatility spiked above long-term volatility during a period of GBPUSD weakness.\nThis signaled a correction or relief rally in the currency pair and that was exactly\nwhat we saw in September when the GBPUSD bounced more than 200 pips. The\nsecond arrow shows an instance where short-term volatility spiked well below\nlong-term volatility and that foreshadowed a major breakdown in the currency pair.\nIn this case, GBPUSD dropped over 600 pips after a period of consolidation.\nIn Figure 24.2 we have a chart of USDJPY. Like GBPUSD, the one-month and\nthree-month option volatilities move very closely.

After eyeing a historical\nrange, traders should look at volatiliti es to estimate the likelihood that the spot\nprice will remain within this range. Should the trader decide to go long or short\nthis range, he or she should continue to monitor volatility as long as he or she has\nan open position in the pair to assist them in determining when to close out that\nposition. If short-term volatilities fall well below long-term volatilities, the trader\nshould consider closing their position if the suspected breakout is not in their favor.\nThe potential break is likely to work in the favor of the trader if the current spot\nis close to the limit and far from the stop.

Generally speaking, we use three-month volatilities for long-\nterm volatilities numbers and one-month volatilities for the short term. Volatilities\ncan be found on Bloomberg or Reuters.\nThe next step is to start compiling a list of data with the date, currency pair price,\nimplied one-month volatility, and implie d three-month volatility for the various\ncurrency pairs in Excel.

The graph should use two y-axes, with spot prices on one and short- and\nlong-term volatilities on the other. If desired, the differences in short- and long-term\nvolatilities can be graphed as well in a separate, single y-axis graph.\n195CHAPTER 25\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nIntervention\nIntervention by central banks is one of the most important short- and long-term\nfundamentally driven market movers for the currency market. For short-term\ntraders, intervention can lead to sharp intraday movements on the scale of 150–250\npips in a matter of minutes. For longer-term traders, intervention can signal a\nsigniﬁcant change in trend because it suggests that the central bank is shifting or\nsolidifying its stance and sending a message to the market that they are backing certain\ndirectional move in their currency. There are basically two types of intervention:\nsterilized and unsterilized. Sterilized intervention requires offsetting intervention\nwith the buying or selling of government bonds while unsterilized intervention\ninvolves no changes to the monetary base to offset intervention. Many argue that\nunsterilized intervention has a more lasting effect on the currency than sterilized\nintervention.\nTaking a look at some of the following case studies, it is apparent that interventions\nin general are important to watch and can have large impacts on a currency pair’s\nprice action. Although the actual timing of an intervention tends to be a surprise,\nquite often the market will begin talking about the need for intervention days or\nweeks before the actual intervention occurs. The direction of an intervention is\nalmost always known in advance because the central bank will typically come across\nthe newswires complaining about too much strength or weakness in their currency.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION196These warnings give traders a window of opportunity to participate in what could\nbe signiﬁcant proﬁt potentials or to stay out of the markets. The only thing to watch\nout for, which you will see in our case study is that the sharp intervention based\nrallies or selloffs can quickly be reversed as speculators come into the market to\n‘‘fade the central bank.’’ Whether or not the market fades, the central bank depends\non the frequency of central bank intervention, the success rate, the magnitude of\nthe intervention, the timing of the intervention, and whether fundamentals support\nintervention. Intervention is much more prevalent in emerging market currencies\nthan in the G7 currencies because these countries need to prevent their local\ncurrencies from appreciating too signiﬁcantly such that it would hinder economic\nrecovery and reduce the competitiveness of the country’s exports. Nonetheless, G7\ninterventions will happen and its rarity is exactly what makes them signiﬁcant.\n■Japan\nIn the past two decades, the central bank most willing to engage intervention is the\nBank of Japan. As an export dependent country, a strong yen poses a major risk to\nthe export sector. While the Bank of Japan conducts the intervention, the decision\nis made by the Ministry of Finance. The most recent case of intervention by the\nJapanese gover nment was in 2011. The BoJ largely s tayed out of the market between\n2012 and 2015 because Abenomics helped to drive a recovery in the economy. On\nOctober 31, 2011, USDJPY hit a record low, which means that the Japanese yen hit\na record high. Frustrated with the currency’s strength after the 2011 earthquake and\ntsunami, the Japanese government came into the forex market aggressively to sell\nthe yen and buy the dollar. On that day, their intervention efforts drove USDJPY\nfrom a low of 75.575 to a high of 79.50, almost 400 pips. As shown in Figure 25.1,\n90% of this move happened in the ﬁrst 35 minutes.\n75.0076.0077.0078.0079.0080.00\n14:00\n16:26\n17:56\n19:27\n21:01\n22:32\n0:03\n1:34\n3:09\n4:40\n6:11\n7:42\n9:29\n17:18\n1:24\n9:29\n17:37\n1:42\n9:48\n17:37\n2:01\n10:06USDJPY Oct 31, 2011\nFIGURE 25.1 USDJPY Chart\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION197The Bank of Japan also bought USDJPY in August 2011, but one of their biggest\nintervention programs was in March 2011, when central banks around the world\njoined the BoJ to sell the yen as a sign of solidarity after an earthquake and tsunami\ndrove the currency to a record high. On that day, intervention only drove USDJPY\nfrom 79.18 to 82, but a few weeks later it hit a high of 85.50, as shown in Figure 25.2.\nThe Bank of Japan also intervened in September 2015 and as shown in Figure 25.3,\na daily chart, USDJPY jumped nearly 300 pips that day. Typically, USDJPY will\nmove 75 to 150 pips on an average day, so a 300-pip move that happens in minutes\nis signiﬁcant. In all but one of these four cases, the intervention move was reversed\nalmost immediately. The only reason why USDJPY extended its rally in March 2011\nwas because the intervention was coordinated with other central banks, making it\nmore powerful.\nWhile the Japanese government has been quieter in recent years, they were\nvery active in the early twenty-ﬁrst cen tury. The frequency and strength of BoJ\nintervention during this period created an invisible ﬂoor under USDJPY. Although\nthere has been no more mention of this ﬂoor in recent years, the BoJ/MoF instilled\nenough fear that intervention is always a worry. This fear is well justiﬁed because in\nthe event of BoJ intervention, the average 100-pip daily range can easily triple.\nJapanese intervention can be traded one of two ways—ride the move on the\nday of intervention or fade it in the days that follow. The key is not to be greedy,\nbecause the Japanese government can always step in again. Committing to take a\nsolid 100-pip proﬁt (of a 150–200 pip move) or using a very short-term intraday\ntrailing stop of 15–20 pips, for example, can be helpful.\n■Switzerland\nThe Swiss National Bank’s 1.20 EURCHF ﬂoor is another form of intervention.\nFaced with a high level of uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued\ncurrency, and deﬂation risks in 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange\nrate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At the time, they pledged to sell francs in an unlimited\nquantity to maintain the peg. The goal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping\nthe gain in the franc. As shown in Figure 25.4, the peg was very effective in keeping\nEURCHF above 1.20 between late 2012 an d 2014. However, in January 2015, the\nprospect of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank pushed the SNB to\nabandon their peg, and their surprise announcement caused a 30% one-day decline\nin EURCHF. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\nOther central banks have also intervened in their currency in the past decade\nincluding the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Unfortunately, for the RBNZ, most\nof their efforts failed with the currency rising after each round of intervention.

They have only\nintervened a few times before, the most recent of which was in 2000. The ECB\ncame into the market to buy euros when the single currency dropped from 90 cents\nto 84 cents. In January 1999, when the euro was ﬁrst launched it was valued at\n1.17 against the U.S. dollar. Due to the sharp slide, the European Central Bank\n(ECB) convinced the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada to\njoin them in coordinated intervention to prop up the euro for the ﬁrst time ever.\nThe Eurozone felt concerned that the market was lacking conﬁdence in their new\ncurrency but also feared that the slide in their currency was increasing the cost of the\nregion’s oil imports. With energy prices hitting 10-year highs at the time, Europe’s\nheavy dependence on oil imports necessitated a stronger currency. The U.S. agreed\nto intervention because buying euros and selling dollars would help to boost the\nvalue of European imports and aid in the funding of an already growing U.S. trade\ndeﬁcit. Tokyo joined in the intervention because they were becoming concerned\nthat the weaker euro was posing a threat to their own exports. Although the ECB\ndid not release details on the magnitude of their intervention, the Federal Reserve\nreported having purchased 1.5 billion euros against the dollar on behalf of the ECB.\nEven though the actual intervention itse lf caught the market by surprise, the ECB\ngave good warning to the market with numerous bouts of verbal support from ECB\nand EU ofﬁcials. For trading purposes, this would have given traders an opportunity\nto buy euros in anticipation of intervention or to avoid shorting the EURUSD.\nFigure 25.5 shows the price action of the EURUSD on the day of intervention.\nUnfortunately, there is no minute data available dating back to September 2000,\nbut from the daily chart, we can see that on the day that the ECB intervened in the\neuro (September 22, 2000), with the help of its trade partners, the EURUSD had a\nhigh-low range of over 400 pips.\nEven though intervention does not happen often, it is a very important fundamental\ntrading strategy because each time it occurs, price movements are substantial.\nFor traders, intervention has three major implications for trading:\n1.Bet on intervention : Heed the warnings from central bank ofﬁcials and use it as\na signal for possible intervention—the invisible ﬂoor created by the Japanese\ngovernment gave USDJPY bulls plenty of opportunity to pick short-term\nbottoms.\n2.Avoid betting against intervention : Betting against intervention can be dangerous\nbecause one bout of intervention by a central bank could easily trigger a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION201EURUSD (September 2000)\n0.91\n0.90\n0.89\n0.88\n0.87\n0.86\n0.85\n0.84\n09/01/2000 09/03/2000 09/05/2000 09/07/2000 09/09/2000 09/11/2000 09/13/2000 09/15/2000 09/17/2000 09/19/2000 09/21/2000 09/23/2000 09/25/2000 09/27/2000 09/29/2000 10/01/2000 10/03/2000\nFIGURE 25.5 EURUSD Intervention\nsharp 100–150 plus pip move in the currency pair, taking out stop orders and\nexacerbating the move.\n3.Use stops when intervention is a risk : With the 24-hour nature of the market,\nintervention can occur at any time of the day.

        "187CHAPTER 23\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nRisk Reversals\nRisk reversals are a useful fundamental-based tool to add to your mix of trading\nindicators. One of the weaknesses of currency trading is the lack of volume data\nand accurate indicators for gauging sentiment. The only publicly available report\non positioning is the Commitment of Traders Report published by the Commodity and\nFutures Commission. Unfortunately, this report is released with a three-day delay.\nA useful alternative is to use risk reversals—which are provided on a real-time basis\non the FXCM News Plugin , under options, or on the Bl oomberg/Reuters terminals.\nAs we ﬁrst introduced in Chapter 7, a risk reversal consists of a pair of options\nfor the same currency (a call and a put). Based on put–call parity, these far out of\nthe money options (25 delta) with the same expiration and strike price should also\nhave the same implied volatility. However, in reality, this is not true. Sentiment is\nembedded in volatilities, which makes risk reversals a good tool to gauge market\nsentiment. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates that there is more\ndemand for calls than puts. The opposite is also true; a number strongly in favor of\nputs over calls indicates that there is a premium built in put options as a result of the\nhigher demand. If risk reversals are near zero, it indicates that there is indecision\namong bulls and bears and that there is no strong bias in the markets.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS1884/28–1 .50–1 .00–0.500.00RR %0.501. 0 01. 5 02.00\n7/7 3/290.910.99\n0.97\n0.95\n0.93\n0.89\n0.87\n0.85\n0.83\n0.81\n0.79\n0.77\nEURUSD\n0.75\n1/18 11/9RRs Spot\n8/31 6/22 4/13 2/2 11/24 9/15EURUSD and Risk Reversals\nFIGURE 23.1 EURUSD Risk Reversal Chart\n■What Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nWe showed this table before in Chapter 7, but want to present it again to make\nsure that it is understood well (see Figure 23.1). Each of the abbreviations for the\ncurrency options are listed; and as indicated, most risk reversals are near zero,\nwhich reﬂects no major bias for puts or calls. However, for USDJPY, the longer-\nterm risk reversals indicate that the market is strongly favoring yen calls (JC) and\ndollar puts.\n■How Can You Use This Information?\nFor easier graphing and tracking purposes, we use positive and negative integers\nfor calls and put premiums respectively. A positive number indicates that calls\nare preferred over puts and that the market as a whole anticipates an upward\nmovement in the underlying currency. Likewise, a negative number indicates that\nputs are preferred over calls and that the market is expecting a down-move in the\nunderlying currency. Used prudently, risk reversals can be a valuable tool in judging\nmarket positioning. While the signals generated by a risk reversal system will not\nbe completely accurate, they can help investors judge whether the market is bullish\nor bearish.\nRisk reversals become particularly important when the values are at extreme\nlevels. We identify extreme levels as one standard deviation plus or minus the average\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS189risk reversal. When risk reversals are at these levels, they give off contrarian signals,\nindicating that a currency pair is overbought or oversold based upon sentiment.\nThe indicator is perceived as a contrarian signal because when the entire market\nis positioned for a rise in a given currency, it makes it harder for the currency to\nrally and easier for it to fall on negative news or events. As a result, a strongly\nnegative number implies oversold conditions whereas a strongly negative number\nwould imply overbought conditions. Although the buy or sell signals produced by\nrisk reversals are not perfect, they can convey additional information used to make\ntrading decisions.\nExamples\nTake a look at our ﬁrst example of the EURUSD (Figure 23.1). Visually, you can see\nthat 25 delta risk reversals have been a leading indicator for EURUSD price action.\nWhen risk reversals plunged to –1.39 o n September 30, it was a signal that the\nmarket had a strong bearish bias. This proved to be a reliable contrarian indicator\nof what eventually became a 300-pip rebound in the EURUSD over the course of\nnine days. When prices spiked once again almost immediately to 0.67 in favor of a\ncontinuation of the up move, the EURUSD proved bulls wrong by engaging in an\neven deeper selloff. Although there were many instances of risk reversals signaling\ncontra-trend moves on a smaller scale, the next major spike came a year later. On\nAugust 16, risk reversals were at 1.43, which meant that bullish sentiment hit a\nvery high level. This preceded a 260-pip drop in the EURUSD over the course of\nthree weeks. When risk reve rsals spiked once again a month later to 1.90, we saw\nanother top in the EURUSD, which later became a much deeper descent.\nGBP/USD\n1. 7 0\n1. 6 5\n1. 6 0\n1. 5 5\n1. 5 0\n1. 4 5\n1. 4 0\n1. 3 5\n1. 3 0\nNov-00 Apr-01 Oct-01 Mar-02 Sep-02 Feb-03 Aug-031. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.0\n–0.5\n–1 .0GBP/USD Sell\nBuy RR %RR %\nBuy\nFIGURE 23.2 GBPUSD Risk Reversal Chart\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS190The next example is the GBPUSD.

Buy\nand sell levels are added to the GBPUSD chart for further clariﬁcation of how risk\nreversals can also be used to time market turns. With the lack of price volume data\nto give us a sense of where the market is positioned, risk reversals can be helpful in\ngauging general market sentiment.\n191CHAPTER 24\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nUsing Option\nVolatilities to Time\nMarket Movements\nUsing option volatilities to time foreign exchange spot movement is a topic that\nwe touched on brieﬂy in Chapter 7. This strategy warrants a more detailed\nexplanation because it has long been a favorite for professional traders and hedge\nfunds. Volatility can be deﬁned as a measure of a currency’s expected ﬂuctuation\nover a given time period based on past price ﬂuctuations. This is typically calculated\nby taking the historic annual standard deviation of daily price changes. Future prices\nhelp to determine implied volatility, which is used to calculate option premiums.\nAlthough this sounds fairly complicated, its application is not. Basically, option\nvolatilities measure the rate and magnitude of a currency’s price over a given period\nof time based on historical ﬂuctuations. Therefore, if the average daily trading range\nof the EURUSD contracted from 100 pips to 60 pips and stayed there for two\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY192weeks, in all likelihood, short- term volatility also contra cted signiﬁcantly compared\nto longer-term volatility during the same time period.\n■How to Use Option Volatilities to Trade Forex\nAs a guideline, there are two simple rules to follow. The ﬁrst one is that if\nshort-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly lower than long-term volatilities, one\nshould expect a breakout, though the direction of the breakout will not be deﬁned\nby this rule. Lastly, if short-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than\nlong-term volatilities, one should expect a reversion to range trading.\nWhy Does This Technique Work?\nDuring a period of consolidation, implied option volatilities are either low or on\nthe decline. The inspiration for these rules is that in periods of range trading, there\ntends to be little movement. We care most about when option volatilities drop\nsharply, which could be a sign that a proﬁtable break is underway. When short-term\nvolatility is above long-term volatility, it means that near-term price action is more\nvolatile than the long-term average price action. This suggests that the ranges will\neventually contract back toward average levels. The trend is most noticeable in\nempirical data. Below are a few examples of how this rule predicted breakouts\nthat turned into new trends but before analyzing the charts, it is important to note\nthat we use one-month volatilities as our short-term volatilities and three-month\nvolatilities as our long-term volatilities.\nIn Figure 24.1, the one-month volatility of GBPUSD is generally close to three-\nmonth volatilities. However, the ﬁrst arrow shows an instance where short-term\nvolatility spiked above long-term volatility during a period of GBPUSD weakness.\nThis signaled a correction or relief rally in the currency pair and that was exactly\nwhat we saw in September when the GBPUSD bounced more than 200 pips. The\nsecond arrow shows an instance where short-term volatility spiked well below\nlong-term volatility and that foreshadowed a major breakdown in the currency pair.\nIn this case, GBPUSD dropped over 600 pips after a period of consolidation.\nIn Figure 24.2 we have a chart of USDJPY. Like GBPUSD, the one-month and\nthree-month option volatilities move very closely. However in May, one-month\nvolatilities dropped sharply below three-month volatilities and that foreshadowed\nthe ﬁrst breakout in more than two months.\nWho Can Beneﬁt from This Technique?\nThis strategy is not only useful for breakout traders, but range traders can also utilize\nthis information for their trading.

After eyeing a historical\nrange, traders should look at volatiliti es to estimate the likelihood that the spot\nprice will remain within this range. Should the trader decide to go long or short\nthis range, he or she should continue to monitor volatility as long as he or she has\nan open position in the pair to assist them in determining when to close out that\nposition. If short-term volatilities fall well below long-term volatilities, the trader\nshould consider closing their position if the suspected breakout is not in their favor.\nThe potential break is likely to work in the favor of the trader if the current spot\nis close to the limit and far from the stop. In this hypothetical situation, it may be\nproﬁtable to move limit prices away from current spot prices to increase proﬁts\nfrom the potential break. If the spot price is close to the stop price and far from the\nlimit price, the break is likely to work against the trader, and the trader should close\nhis or her position immediately.\nBreakout traders can monitor volatilities to verify a breakout. If traders suspect\na breakout, he or she can verify this breakout though implied volatilities. Should\nimplied volatility be constant or rising, there is a higher probability that the currency\nwill continue to trade in range than if vola tility is low or falling. In other words,\nbreakout traders should look for short-term volatilities to be signiﬁcantly lower than\nlong-term volatilities before making a breakout trade.\nAside from being a key component for pricing, option volatilities can also be\na useful tool for forecasting market activities. Option volatilities measure the rate\nand magnitude of the changes in a currency’ s prices. Implied option volatilities, on\nthe other hand, measure the expected ﬂuctuation of a currency’s price over a given\nperiod of time based on historical ﬂuctuations.\n■Tracking Volatilities on Your Own\nVolatility tracking typically involves taking the historic annual standard deviation of\ndaily price changes. Generally speaking, we use three-month volatilities for long-\nterm volatilities numbers and one-month volatilities for the short term. Volatilities\ncan be found on Bloomberg or Reuters.\nThe next step is to start compiling a list of data with the date, currency pair price,\nimplied one-month volatility, and implie d three-month volatility for the various\ncurrency pairs in Excel. It might also be beneﬁcial to ﬁnd the difference between the\none-month and three-month volatilities to look for large differentials or to calculate\none-month volatility as a percentage of three-month volatility.\nOnce a sufﬁcient amount of data is compiled, one can graph the data as a visual\naid. The graph should use two y-axes, with spot prices on one and short- and\nlong-term volatilities on the other. If desired, the differences in short- and long-term\nvolatilities can be graphed as well in a separate, single y-axis graph.\n195CHAPTER 25\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nIntervention\nIntervention by central banks is one of the most important short- and long-term\nfundamentally driven market movers for the currency market. For short-term\ntraders, intervention can lead to sharp intraday movements on the scale of 150–250\npips in a matter of minutes. For longer-term traders, intervention can signal a\nsigniﬁcant change in trend because it suggests that the central bank is shifting or\nsolidifying its stance and sending a message to the market that they are backing certain\ndirectional move in their currency.

The only thing to watch\nout for, which you will see in our case study is that the sharp intervention based\nrallies or selloffs can quickly be reversed as speculators come into the market to\n‘‘fade the central bank.’’ Whether or not the market fades, the central bank depends\non the frequency of central bank intervention, the success rate, the magnitude of\nthe intervention, the timing of the intervention, and whether fundamentals support\nintervention. Intervention is much more prevalent in emerging market currencies\nthan in the G7 currencies because these countries need to prevent their local\ncurrencies from appreciating too signiﬁcantly such that it would hinder economic\nrecovery and reduce the competitiveness of the country’s exports. Nonetheless, G7\ninterventions will happen and its rarity is exactly what makes them signiﬁcant.\n■Japan\nIn the past two decades, the central bank most willing to engage intervention is the\nBank of Japan. As an export dependent country, a strong yen poses a major risk to\nthe export sector. While the Bank of Japan conducts the intervention, the decision\nis made by the Ministry of Finance. The most recent case of intervention by the\nJapanese gover nment was in 2011. The BoJ largely s tayed out of the market between\n2012 and 2015 because Abenomics helped to drive a recovery in the economy. On\nOctober 31, 2011, USDJPY hit a record low, which means that the Japanese yen hit\na record high. Frustrated with the currency’s strength after the 2011 earthquake and\ntsunami, the Japanese government came into the forex market aggressively to sell\nthe yen and buy the dollar. On that day, their intervention efforts drove USDJPY\nfrom a low of 75.575 to a high of 79.50, almost 400 pips. As shown in Figure 25.1,\n90% of this move happened in the ﬁrst 35 minutes.\n75.0076.0077.0078.0079.0080.00\n14:00\n16:26\n17:56\n19:27\n21:01\n22:32\n0:03\n1:34\n3:09\n4:40\n6:11\n7:42\n9:29\n17:18\n1:24\n9:29\n17:37\n1:42\n9:48\n17:37\n2:01\n10:06USDJPY Oct 31, 2011\nFIGURE 25.1 USDJPY Chart\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION197The Bank of Japan also bought USDJPY in August 2011, but one of their biggest\nintervention programs was in March 2011, when central banks around the world\njoined the BoJ to sell the yen as a sign of solidarity after an earthquake and tsunami\ndrove the currency to a record high. On that day, intervention only drove USDJPY\nfrom 79.18 to 82, but a few weeks later it hit a high of 85.50, as shown in Figure 25.2.\nThe Bank of Japan also intervened in September 2015 and as shown in Figure 25.3,\na daily chart, USDJPY jumped nearly 300 pips that day. Typically, USDJPY will\nmove 75 to 150 pips on an average day, so a 300-pip move that happens in minutes\nis signiﬁcant. In all but one of these four cases, the intervention move was reversed\nalmost immediately. The only reason why USDJPY extended its rally in March 2011\nwas because the intervention was coordinated with other central banks, making it\nmore powerful.\nWhile the Japanese government has been quieter in recent years, they were\nvery active in the early twenty-ﬁrst cen tury. The frequency and strength of BoJ\nintervention during this period created an invisible ﬂoor under USDJPY. Although\nthere has been no more mention of this ﬂoor in recent years, the BoJ/MoF instilled\nenough fear that intervention is always a worry. This fear is well justiﬁed because in\nthe event of BoJ intervention, the average 100-pip daily range can easily triple.\nJapanese intervention can be traded one of two ways—ride the move on the\nday of intervention or fade it in the days that follow. The key is not to be greedy,\nbecause the Japanese government can always step in again. Committing to take a\nsolid 100-pip proﬁt (of a 150–200 pip move) or using a very short-term intraday\ntrailing stop of 15–20 pips, for example, can be helpful.\n■Switzerland\nThe Swiss National Bank’s 1.20 EURCHF ﬂoor is another form of intervention.\nFaced with a high level of uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued\ncurrency, and deﬂation risks in 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange\nrate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At the time, they pledged to sell francs in an unlimited\nquantity to maintain the peg. The goal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping\nthe gain in the franc. As shown in Figure 25.4, the peg was very effective in keeping\nEURCHF above 1.20 between late 2012 an d 2014. However, in January 2015, the\nprospect of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank pushed the SNB to\nabandon their peg, and their surprise announcement caused a 30% one-day decline\nin EURCHF. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\nOther central banks have also intervened in their currency in the past decade\nincluding the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Unfortunately, for the RBNZ, most\nof their efforts failed with the currency rising after each round of intervention.

They have only\nintervened a few times before, the most recent of which was in 2000. The ECB\ncame into the market to buy euros when the single currency dropped from 90 cents\nto 84 cents. In January 1999, when the euro was ﬁrst launched it was valued at\n1.17 against the U.S. dollar. Due to the sharp slide, the European Central Bank\n(ECB) convinced the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada to\njoin them in coordinated intervention to prop up the euro for the ﬁrst time ever.\nThe Eurozone felt concerned that the market was lacking conﬁdence in their new\ncurrency but also feared that the slide in their currency was increasing the cost of the\nregion’s oil imports. With energy prices hitting 10-year highs at the time, Europe’s\nheavy dependence on oil imports necessitated a stronger currency. The U.S. agreed\nto intervention because buying euros and selling dollars would help to boost the\nvalue of European imports and aid in the funding of an already growing U.S. trade\ndeﬁcit. Tokyo joined in the intervention because they were becoming concerned\nthat the weaker euro was posing a threat to their own exports. Although the ECB\ndid not release details on the magnitude of their intervention, the Federal Reserve\nreported having purchased 1.5 billion euros against the dollar on behalf of the ECB.\nEven though the actual intervention itse lf caught the market by surprise, the ECB\ngave good warning to the market with numerous bouts of verbal support from ECB\nand EU ofﬁcials. For trading purposes, this would have given traders an opportunity\nto buy euros in anticipation of intervention or to avoid shorting the EURUSD.\nFigure 25.5 shows the price action of the EURUSD on the day of intervention.\nUnfortunately, there is no minute data available dating back to September 2000,\nbut from the daily chart, we can see that on the day that the ECB intervened in the\neuro (September 22, 2000), with the help of its trade partners, the EURUSD had a\nhigh-low range of over 400 pips.\nEven though intervention does not happen often, it is a very important fundamental\ntrading strategy because each time it occurs, price movements are substantial.\nFor traders, intervention has three major implications for trading:\n1.Bet on intervention : Heed the warnings from central bank ofﬁcials and use it as\na signal for possible intervention—the invisible ﬂoor created by the Japanese\ngovernment gave USDJPY bulls plenty of opportunity to pick short-term\nbottoms.\n2.Avoid betting against intervention : Betting against intervention can be dangerous\nbecause one bout of intervention by a central bank could easily trigger a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION201EURUSD (September 2000)\n0.91\n0.90\n0.89\n0.88\n0.87\n0.86\n0.85\n0.84\n09/01/2000 09/03/2000 09/05/2000 09/07/2000 09/09/2000 09/11/2000 09/13/2000 09/15/2000 09/17/2000 09/19/2000 09/21/2000 09/23/2000 09/25/2000 09/27/2000 09/29/2000 10/01/2000 10/03/2000\nFIGURE 25.5 EURUSD Intervention\nsharp 100–150 plus pip move in the currency pair, taking out stop orders and\nexacerbating the move.\n3.Use stops when intervention is a risk : With the 24-hour nature of the market,\nintervention can occur at any time of the day.

        "187CHAPTER 23\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nRisk Reversals\nRisk reversals are a useful fundamental-based tool to add to your mix of trading\nindicators. One of the weaknesses of currency trading is the lack of volume data\nand accurate indicators for gauging sentiment. The only publicly available report\non positioning is the Commitment of Traders Report published by the Commodity and\nFutures Commission. Unfortunately, this report is released with a three-day delay.\nA useful alternative is to use risk reversals—which are provided on a real-time basis\non the FXCM News Plugin , under options, or on the Bl oomberg/Reuters terminals.\nAs we ﬁrst introduced in Chapter 7, a risk reversal consists of a pair of options\nfor the same currency (a call and a put). Based on put–call parity, these far out of\nthe money options (25 delta) with the same expiration and strike price should also\nhave the same implied volatility. However, in reality, this is not true. Sentiment is\nembedded in volatilities, which makes risk reversals a good tool to gauge market\nsentiment. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates that there is more\ndemand for calls than puts. The opposite is also true; a number strongly in favor of\nputs over calls indicates that there is a premium built in put options as a result of the\nhigher demand. If risk reversals are near zero, it indicates that there is indecision\namong bulls and bears and that there is no strong bias in the markets.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS1884/28–1 .50–1 .00–0.500.00RR %0.501. 0 01. 5 02.00\n7/7 3/290.910.99\n0.97\n0.95\n0.93\n0.89\n0.87\n0.85\n0.83\n0.81\n0.79\n0.77\nEURUSD\n0.75\n1/18 11/9RRs Spot\n8/31 6/22 4/13 2/2 11/24 9/15EURUSD and Risk Reversals\nFIGURE 23.1 EURUSD Risk Reversal Chart\n■What Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nWe showed this table before in Chapter 7, but want to present it again to make\nsure that it is understood well (see Figure 23.1). Each of the abbreviations for the\ncurrency options are listed; and as indicated, most risk reversals are near zero,\nwhich reﬂects no major bias for puts or calls. However, for USDJPY, the longer-\nterm risk reversals indicate that the market is strongly favoring yen calls (JC) and\ndollar puts.\n■How Can You Use This Information?\nFor easier graphing and tracking purposes, we use positive and negative integers\nfor calls and put premiums respectively. A positive number indicates that calls\nare preferred over puts and that the market as a whole anticipates an upward\nmovement in the underlying currency. Likewise, a negative number indicates that\nputs are preferred over calls and that the market is expecting a down-move in the\nunderlying currency. Used prudently, risk reversals can be a valuable tool in judging\nmarket positioning. While the signals generated by a risk reversal system will not\nbe completely accurate, they can help investors judge whether the market is bullish\nor bearish.\nRisk reversals become particularly important when the values are at extreme\nlevels. We identify extreme levels as one standard deviation plus or minus the average\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS189risk reversal. When risk reversals are at these levels, they give off contrarian signals,\nindicating that a currency pair is overbought or oversold based upon sentiment.\nThe indicator is perceived as a contrarian signal because when the entire market\nis positioned for a rise in a given currency, it makes it harder for the currency to\nrally and easier for it to fall on negative news or events. As a result, a strongly\nnegative number implies oversold conditions whereas a strongly negative number\nwould imply overbought conditions. Although the buy or sell signals produced by\nrisk reversals are not perfect, they can convey additional information used to make\ntrading decisions.\nExamples\nTake a look at our ﬁrst example of the EURUSD (Figure 23.1). Visually, you can see\nthat 25 delta risk reversals have been a leading indicator for EURUSD price action.\nWhen risk reversals plunged to –1.39 o n September 30, it was a signal that the\nmarket had a strong bearish bias. This proved to be a reliable contrarian indicator\nof what eventually became a 300-pip rebound in the EURUSD over the course of\nnine days. When prices spiked once again almost immediately to 0.67 in favor of a\ncontinuation of the up move, the EURUSD proved bulls wrong by engaging in an\neven deeper selloff. Although there were many instances of risk reversals signaling\ncontra-trend moves on a smaller scale, the next major spike came a year later. On\nAugust 16, risk reversals were at 1.43, which meant that bullish sentiment hit a\nvery high level. This preceded a 260-pip drop in the EURUSD over the course of\nthree weeks. When risk reve rsals spiked once again a month later to 1.90, we saw\nanother top in the EURUSD, which later became a much deeper descent.\nGBP/USD\n1. 7 0\n1. 6 5\n1. 6 0\n1. 5 5\n1. 5 0\n1. 4 5\n1. 4 0\n1. 3 5\n1. 3 0\nNov-00 Apr-01 Oct-01 Mar-02 Sep-02 Feb-03 Aug-031. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.0\n–0.5\n–1 .0GBP/USD Sell\nBuy RR %RR %\nBuy\nFIGURE 23.2 GBPUSD Risk Reversal Chart\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS190The next example is the GBPUSD. As can be seen in Figure 23.2, risk reversals\ndo a very good job of identifying extreme overbought and oversold conditions. Buy\nand sell levels are added to the GBPUSD chart for further clariﬁcation of how risk\nreversals can also be used to time market turns. With the lack of price volume data\nto give us a sense of where the market is positioned, risk reversals can be helpful in\ngauging general market sentiment.\n191CHAPTER 24\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nUsing Option\nVolatilities to Time\nMarket Movements\nUsing option volatilities to time foreign exchange spot movement is a topic that\nwe touched on brieﬂy in Chapter 7. This strategy warrants a more detailed\nexplanation because it has long been a favorite for professional traders and hedge\nfunds. Volatility can be deﬁned as a measure of a currency’s expected ﬂuctuation\nover a given time period based on past price ﬂuctuations. This is typically calculated\nby taking the historic annual standard deviation of daily price changes. Future prices\nhelp to determine implied volatility, which is used to calculate option premiums.\nAlthough this sounds fairly complicated, its application is not. Basically, option\nvolatilities measure the rate and magnitude of a currency’s price over a given period\nof time based on historical ﬂuctuations. Therefore, if the average daily trading range\nof the EURUSD contracted from 100 pips to 60 pips and stayed there for two\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY192weeks, in all likelihood, short- term volatility also contra cted signiﬁcantly compared\nto longer-term volatility during the same time period.\n■How to Use Option Volatilities to Trade Forex\nAs a guideline, there are two simple rules to follow. The ﬁrst one is that if\nshort-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly lower than long-term volatilities, one\nshould expect a breakout, though the direction of the breakout will not be deﬁned\nby this rule. Lastly, if short-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than\nlong-term volatilities, one should expect a reversion to range trading.\nWhy Does This Technique Work?\nDuring a period of consolidation, implied option volatilities are either low or on\nthe decline. The inspiration for these rules is that in periods of range trading, there\ntends to be little movement. We care most about when option volatilities drop\nsharply, which could be a sign that a proﬁtable break is underway. When short-term\nvolatility is above long-term volatility, it means that near-term price action is more\nvolatile than the long-term average price action. This suggests that the ranges will\neventually contract back toward average levels. The trend is most noticeable in\nempirical data. Below are a few examples of how this rule predicted breakouts\nthat turned into new trends but before analyzing the charts, it is important to note\nthat we use one-month volatilities as our short-term volatilities and three-month\nvolatilities as our long-term volatilities.\nIn Figure 24.1, the one-month volatility of GBPUSD is generally close to three-\nmonth volatilities. However, the ﬁrst arrow shows an instance where short-term\nvolatility spiked above long-term volatility during a period of GBPUSD weakness.\nThis signaled a correction or relief rally in the currency pair and that was exactly\nwhat we saw in September when the GBPUSD bounced more than 200 pips. The\nsecond arrow shows an instance where short-term volatility spiked well below\nlong-term volatility and that foreshadowed a major breakdown in the currency pair.\nIn this case, GBPUSD dropped over 600 pips after a period of consolidation.\nIn Figure 24.2 we have a chart of USDJPY. Like GBPUSD, the one-month and\nthree-month option volatilities move very closely. However in May, one-month\nvolatilities dropped sharply below three-month volatilities and that foreshadowed\nthe ﬁrst breakout in more than two months.\nWho Can Beneﬁt from This Technique?\nThis strategy is not only useful for breakout traders, but range traders can also utilize\nthis information for their trading.

After eyeing a historical\nrange, traders should look at volatiliti es to estimate the likelihood that the spot\nprice will remain within this range. Should the trader decide to go long or short\nthis range, he or she should continue to monitor volatility as long as he or she has\nan open position in the pair to assist them in determining when to close out that\nposition. If short-term volatilities fall well below long-term volatilities, the trader\nshould consider closing their position if the suspected breakout is not in their favor.\nThe potential break is likely to work in the favor of the trader if the current spot\nis close to the limit and far from the stop. In this hypothetical situation, it may be\nproﬁtable to move limit prices away from current spot prices to increase proﬁts\nfrom the potential break. If the spot price is close to the stop price and far from the\nlimit price, the break is likely to work against the trader, and the trader should close\nhis or her position immediately.\nBreakout traders can monitor volatilities to verify a breakout. If traders suspect\na breakout, he or she can verify this breakout though implied volatilities. Should\nimplied volatility be constant or rising, there is a higher probability that the currency\nwill continue to trade in range than if vola tility is low or falling. In other words,\nbreakout traders should look for short-term volatilities to be signiﬁcantly lower than\nlong-term volatilities before making a breakout trade.\nAside from being a key component for pricing, option volatilities can also be\na useful tool for forecasting market activities. Option volatilities measure the rate\nand magnitude of the changes in a currency’ s prices. Implied option volatilities, on\nthe other hand, measure the expected ﬂuctuation of a currency’s price over a given\nperiod of time based on historical ﬂuctuations.\n■Tracking Volatilities on Your Own\nVolatility tracking typically involves taking the historic annual standard deviation of\ndaily price changes. Generally speaking, we use three-month volatilities for long-\nterm volatilities numbers and one-month volatilities for the short term. Volatilities\ncan be found on Bloomberg or Reuters.\nThe next step is to start compiling a list of data with the date, currency pair price,\nimplied one-month volatility, and implie d three-month volatility for the various\ncurrency pairs in Excel. It might also be beneﬁcial to ﬁnd the difference between the\none-month and three-month volatilities to look for large differentials or to calculate\none-month volatility as a percentage of three-month volatility.\nOnce a sufﬁcient amount of data is compiled, one can graph the data as a visual\naid. The graph should use two y-axes, with spot prices on one and short- and\nlong-term volatilities on the other. If desired, the differences in short- and long-term\nvolatilities can be graphed as well in a separate, single y-axis graph.\n195CHAPTER 25\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nIntervention\nIntervention by central banks is one of the most important short- and long-term\nfundamentally driven market movers for the currency market. For short-term\ntraders, intervention can lead to sharp intraday movements on the scale of 150–250\npips in a matter of minutes. For longer-term traders, intervention can signal a\nsigniﬁcant change in trend because it suggests that the central bank is shifting or\nsolidifying its stance and sending a message to the market that they are backing certain\ndirectional move in their currency. There are basically two types of intervention:\nsterilized and unsterilized. Sterilized intervention requires offsetting intervention\nwith the buying or selling of government bonds while unsterilized intervention\ninvolves no changes to the monetary base to offset intervention. Many argue that\nunsterilized intervention has a more lasting effect on the currency than sterilized\nintervention.\nTaking a look at some of the following case studies, it is apparent that interventions\nin general are important to watch and can have large impacts on a currency pair’s\nprice action. Although the actual timing of an intervention tends to be a surprise,\nquite often the market will begin talking about the need for intervention days or\nweeks before the actual intervention occurs. The direction of an intervention is\nalmost always known in advance because the central bank will typically come across\nthe newswires complaining about too much strength or weakness in their currency.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION196These warnings give traders a window of opportunity to participate in what could\nbe signiﬁcant proﬁt potentials or to stay out of the markets. The only thing to watch\nout for, which you will see in our case study is that the sharp intervention based\nrallies or selloffs can quickly be reversed as speculators come into the market to\n‘‘fade the central bank.’’ Whether or not the market fades, the central bank depends\non the frequency of central bank intervention, the success rate, the magnitude of\nthe intervention, the timing of the intervention, and whether fundamentals support\nintervention. Intervention is much more prevalent in emerging market currencies\nthan in the G7 currencies because these countries need to prevent their local\ncurrencies from appreciating too signiﬁcantly such that it would hinder economic\nrecovery and reduce the competitiveness of the country’s exports. Nonetheless, G7\ninterventions will happen and its rarity is exactly what makes them signiﬁcant.\n■Japan\nIn the past two decades, the central bank most willing to engage intervention is the\nBank of Japan. As an export dependent country, a strong yen poses a major risk to\nthe export sector. While the Bank of Japan conducts the intervention, the decision\nis made by the Ministry of Finance. The most recent case of intervention by the\nJapanese gover nment was in 2011. The BoJ largely s tayed out of the market between\n2012 and 2015 because Abenomics helped to drive a recovery in the economy. On\nOctober 31, 2011, USDJPY hit a record low, which means that the Japanese yen hit\na record high. Frustrated with the currency’s strength after the 2011 earthquake and\ntsunami, the Japanese government came into the forex market aggressively to sell\nthe yen and buy the dollar. On that day, their intervention efforts drove USDJPY\nfrom a low of 75.575 to a high of 79.50, almost 400 pips. As shown in Figure 25.1,\n90% of this move happened in the ﬁrst 35 minutes.\n75.0076.0077.0078.0079.0080.00\n14:00\n16:26\n17:56\n19:27\n21:01\n22:32\n0:03\n1:34\n3:09\n4:40\n6:11\n7:42\n9:29\n17:18\n1:24\n9:29\n17:37\n1:42\n9:48\n17:37\n2:01\n10:06USDJPY Oct 31, 2011\nFIGURE 25.1 USDJPY Chart\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION197The Bank of Japan also bought USDJPY in August 2011, but one of their biggest\nintervention programs was in March 2011, when central banks around the world\njoined the BoJ to sell the yen as a sign of solidarity after an earthquake and tsunami\ndrove the currency to a record high. On that day, intervention only drove USDJPY\nfrom 79.18 to 82, but a few weeks later it hit a high of 85.50, as shown in Figure 25.2.\nThe Bank of Japan also intervened in September 2015 and as shown in Figure 25.3,\na daily chart, USDJPY jumped nearly 300 pips that day. Typically, USDJPY will\nmove 75 to 150 pips on an average day, so a 300-pip move that happens in minutes\nis signiﬁcant. In all but one of these four cases, the intervention move was reversed\nalmost immediately. The only reason why USDJPY extended its rally in March 2011\nwas because the intervention was coordinated with other central banks, making it\nmore powerful.\nWhile the Japanese government has been quieter in recent years, they were\nvery active in the early twenty-ﬁrst cen tury. The frequency and strength of BoJ\nintervention during this period created an invisible ﬂoor under USDJPY. Although\nthere has been no more mention of this ﬂoor in recent years, the BoJ/MoF instilled\nenough fear that intervention is always a worry. This fear is well justiﬁed because in\nthe event of BoJ intervention, the average 100-pip daily range can easily triple.\nJapanese intervention can be traded one of two ways—ride the move on the\nday of intervention or fade it in the days that follow. The key is not to be greedy,\nbecause the Japanese government can always step in again. Committing to take a\nsolid 100-pip proﬁt (of a 150–200 pip move) or using a very short-term intraday\ntrailing stop of 15–20 pips, for example, can be helpful.\n■Switzerland\nThe Swiss National Bank’s 1.20 EURCHF ﬂoor is another form of intervention.\nFaced with a high level of uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued\ncurrency, and deﬂation risks in 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange\nrate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At the time, they pledged to sell francs in an unlimited\nquantity to maintain the peg. The goal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping\nthe gain in the franc. As shown in Figure 25.4, the peg was very effective in keeping\nEURCHF above 1.20 between late 2012 an d 2014. However, in January 2015, the\nprospect of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank pushed the SNB to\nabandon their peg, and their surprise announcement caused a 30% one-day decline\nin EURCHF. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\nOther central banks have also intervened in their currency in the past decade\nincluding the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Unfortunately, for the RBNZ, most\nof their efforts failed with the currency rising after each round of intervention.

They have only\nintervened a few times before, the most recent of which was in 2000. The ECB\ncame into the market to buy euros when the single currency dropped from 90 cents\nto 84 cents. In January 1999, when the euro was ﬁrst launched it was valued at\n1.17 against the U.S. dollar. Due to the sharp slide, the European Central Bank\n(ECB) convinced the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada to\njoin them in coordinated intervention to prop up the euro for the ﬁrst time ever.\nThe Eurozone felt concerned that the market was lacking conﬁdence in their new\ncurrency but also feared that the slide in their currency was increasing the cost of the\nregion’s oil imports. With energy prices hitting 10-year highs at the time, Europe’s\nheavy dependence on oil imports necessitated a stronger currency. The U.S. agreed\nto intervention because buying euros and selling dollars would help to boost the\nvalue of European imports and aid in the funding of an already growing U.S. trade\ndeﬁcit. Tokyo joined in the intervention because they were becoming concerned\nthat the weaker euro was posing a threat to their own exports. Although the ECB\ndid not release details on the magnitude of their intervention, the Federal Reserve\nreported having purchased 1.5 billion euros against the dollar on behalf of the ECB.\nEven though the actual intervention itse lf caught the market by surprise, the ECB\ngave good warning to the market with numerous bouts of verbal support from ECB\nand EU ofﬁcials. For trading purposes, this would have given traders an opportunity\nto buy euros in anticipation of intervention or to avoid shorting the EURUSD.\nFigure 25.5 shows the price action of the EURUSD on the day of intervention.\nUnfortunately, there is no minute data available dating back to September 2000,\nbut from the daily chart, we can see that on the day that the ECB intervened in the\neuro (September 22, 2000), with the help of its trade partners, the EURUSD had a\nhigh-low range of over 400 pips.\nEven though intervention does not happen often, it is a very important fundamental\ntrading strategy because each time it occurs, price movements are substantial.\nFor traders, intervention has three major implications for trading:\n1.Bet on intervention : Heed the warnings from central bank ofﬁcials and use it as\na signal for possible intervention—the invisible ﬂoor created by the Japanese\ngovernment gave USDJPY bulls plenty of opportunity to pick short-term\nbottoms.\n2.Avoid betting against intervention : Betting against intervention can be dangerous\nbecause one bout of intervention by a central bank could easily trigger a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION201EURUSD (September 2000)\n0.91\n0.90\n0.89\n0.88\n0.87\n0.86\n0.85\n0.84\n09/01/2000 09/03/2000 09/05/2000 09/07/2000 09/09/2000 09/11/2000 09/13/2000 09/15/2000 09/17/2000 09/19/2000 09/21/2000 09/23/2000 09/25/2000 09/27/2000 09/29/2000 10/01/2000 10/03/2000\nFIGURE 25.5 EURUSD Intervention\nsharp 100–150 plus pip move in the currency pair, taking out stop orders and\nexacerbating the move.\n3.Use stops when intervention is a risk : With the 24-hour nature of the market,\nintervention can occur at any time of the day.

        "187CHAPTER 23\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nRisk Reversals\nRisk reversals are a useful fundamental-based tool to add to your mix of trading\nindicators. One of the weaknesses of currency trading is the lack of volume data\nand accurate indicators for gauging sentiment. The only publicly available report\non positioning is the Commitment of Traders Report published by the Commodity and\nFutures Commission. Unfortunately, this report is released with a three-day delay.\nA useful alternative is to use risk reversals—which are provided on a real-time basis\non the FXCM News Plugin , under options, or on the Bl oomberg/Reuters terminals.\nAs we ﬁrst introduced in Chapter 7, a risk reversal consists of a pair of options\nfor the same currency (a call and a put). Based on put–call parity, these far out of\nthe money options (25 delta) with the same expiration and strike price should also\nhave the same implied volatility. However, in reality, this is not true. Sentiment is\nembedded in volatilities, which makes risk reversals a good tool to gauge market\nsentiment. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates that there is more\ndemand for calls than puts. The opposite is also true; a number strongly in favor of\nputs over calls indicates that there is a premium built in put options as a result of the\nhigher demand. If risk reversals are near zero, it indicates that there is indecision\namong bulls and bears and that there is no strong bias in the markets.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS1884/28–1 .50–1 .00–0.500.00RR %0.501. 0 01. 5 02.00\n7/7 3/290.910.99\n0.97\n0.95\n0.93\n0.89\n0.87\n0.85\n0.83\n0.81\n0.79\n0.77\nEURUSD\n0.75\n1/18 11/9RRs Spot\n8/31 6/22 4/13 2/2 11/24 9/15EURUSD and Risk Reversals\nFIGURE 23.1 EURUSD Risk Reversal Chart\n■What Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nWe showed this table before in Chapter 7, but want to present it again to make\nsure that it is understood well (see Figure 23.1). Each of the abbreviations for the\ncurrency options are listed; and as indicated, most risk reversals are near zero,\nwhich reﬂects no major bias for puts or calls. However, for USDJPY, the longer-\nterm risk reversals indicate that the market is strongly favoring yen calls (JC) and\ndollar puts.\n■How Can You Use This Information?\nFor easier graphing and tracking purposes, we use positive and negative integers\nfor calls and put premiums respectively. A positive number indicates that calls\nare preferred over puts and that the market as a whole anticipates an upward\nmovement in the underlying currency. Likewise, a negative number indicates that\nputs are preferred over calls and that the market is expecting a down-move in the\nunderlying currency. Used prudently, risk reversals can be a valuable tool in judging\nmarket positioning. While the signals generated by a risk reversal system will not\nbe completely accurate, they can help investors judge whether the market is bullish\nor bearish.\nRisk reversals become particularly important when the values are at extreme\nlevels. We identify extreme levels as one standard deviation plus or minus the average\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS189risk reversal. When risk reversals are at these levels, they give off contrarian signals,\nindicating that a currency pair is overbought or oversold based upon sentiment.\nThe indicator is perceived as a contrarian signal because when the entire market\nis positioned for a rise in a given currency, it makes it harder for the currency to\nrally and easier for it to fall on negative news or events. As a result, a strongly\nnegative number implies oversold conditions whereas a strongly negative number\nwould imply overbought conditions. Although the buy or sell signals produced by\nrisk reversals are not perfect, they can convey additional information used to make\ntrading decisions.\nExamples\nTake a look at our ﬁrst example of the EURUSD (Figure 23.1). Visually, you can see\nthat 25 delta risk reversals have been a leading indicator for EURUSD price action.\nWhen risk reversals plunged to –1.39 o n September 30, it was a signal that the\nmarket had a strong bearish bias. This proved to be a reliable contrarian indicator\nof what eventually became a 300-pip rebound in the EURUSD over the course of\nnine days. When prices spiked once again almost immediately to 0.67 in favor of a\ncontinuation of the up move, the EURUSD proved bulls wrong by engaging in an\neven deeper selloff. Although there were many instances of risk reversals signaling\ncontra-trend moves on a smaller scale, the next major spike came a year later. On\nAugust 16, risk reversals were at 1.43, which meant that bullish sentiment hit a\nvery high level. This preceded a 260-pip drop in the EURUSD over the course of\nthree weeks. When risk reve rsals spiked once again a month later to 1.90, we saw\nanother top in the EURUSD, which later became a much deeper descent.\nGBP/USD\n1. 7 0\n1. 6 5\n1. 6 0\n1. 5 5\n1. 5 0\n1. 4 5\n1. 4 0\n1. 3 5\n1. 3 0\nNov-00 Apr-01 Oct-01 Mar-02 Sep-02 Feb-03 Aug-031. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.0\n–0.5\n–1 .0GBP/USD Sell\nBuy RR %RR %\nBuy\nFIGURE 23.2 GBPUSD Risk Reversal Chart\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS190The next example is the GBPUSD. As can be seen in Figure 23.2, risk reversals\ndo a very good job of identifying extreme overbought and oversold conditions. Buy\nand sell levels are added to the GBPUSD chart for further clariﬁcation of how risk\nreversals can also be used to time market turns. With the lack of price volume data\nto give us a sense of where the market is positioned, risk reversals can be helpful in\ngauging general market sentiment.\n191CHAPTER 24\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nUsing Option\nVolatilities to Time\nMarket Movements\nUsing option volatilities to time foreign exchange spot movement is a topic that\nwe touched on brieﬂy in Chapter 7. This strategy warrants a more detailed\nexplanation because it has long been a favorite for professional traders and hedge\nfunds. Volatility can be deﬁned as a measure of a currency’s expected ﬂuctuation\nover a given time period based on past price ﬂuctuations. This is typically calculated\nby taking the historic annual standard deviation of daily price changes. Future prices\nhelp to determine implied volatility, which is used to calculate option premiums.\nAlthough this sounds fairly complicated, its application is not. Basically, option\nvolatilities measure the rate and magnitude of a currency’s price over a given period\nof time based on historical ﬂuctuations. Therefore, if the average daily trading range\nof the EURUSD contracted from 100 pips to 60 pips and stayed there for two\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY192weeks, in all likelihood, short- term volatility also contra cted signiﬁcantly compared\nto longer-term volatility during the same time period.\n■How to Use Option Volatilities to Trade Forex\nAs a guideline, there are two simple rules to follow. The ﬁrst one is that if\nshort-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly lower than long-term volatilities, one\nshould expect a breakout, though the direction of the breakout will not be deﬁned\nby this rule. Lastly, if short-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than\nlong-term volatilities, one should expect a reversion to range trading.\nWhy Does This Technique Work?\nDuring a period of consolidation, implied option volatilities are either low or on\nthe decline. The inspiration for these rules is that in periods of range trading, there\ntends to be little movement. We care most about when option volatilities drop\nsharply, which could be a sign that a proﬁtable break is underway. When short-term\nvolatility is above long-term volatility, it means that near-term price action is more\nvolatile than the long-term average price action. This suggests that the ranges will\neventually contract back toward average levels. The trend is most noticeable in\nempirical data. Below are a few examples of how this rule predicted breakouts\nthat turned into new trends but before analyzing the charts, it is important to note\nthat we use one-month volatilities as our short-term volatilities and three-month\nvolatilities as our long-term volatilities.\nIn Figure 24.1, the one-month volatility of GBPUSD is generally close to three-\nmonth volatilities. However, the ﬁrst arrow shows an instance where short-term\nvolatility spiked above long-term volatility during a period of GBPUSD weakness.\nThis signaled a correction or relief rally in the currency pair and that was exactly\nwhat we saw in September when the GBPUSD bounced more than 200 pips. The\nsecond arrow shows an instance where short-term volatility spiked well below\nlong-term volatility and that foreshadowed a major breakdown in the currency pair.\nIn this case, GBPUSD dropped over 600 pips after a period of consolidation.\nIn Figure 24.2 we have a chart of USDJPY. Like GBPUSD, the one-month and\nthree-month option volatilities move very closely. However in May, one-month\nvolatilities dropped sharply below three-month volatilities and that foreshadowed\nthe ﬁrst breakout in more than two months.\nWho Can Beneﬁt from This Technique?\nThis strategy is not only useful for breakout traders, but range traders can also utilize\nthis information for their trading.

After eyeing a historical\nrange, traders should look at volatiliti es to estimate the likelihood that the spot\nprice will remain within this range. Should the trader decide to go long or short\nthis range, he or she should continue to monitor volatility as long as he or she has\nan open position in the pair to assist them in determining when to close out that\nposition. If short-term volatilities fall well below long-term volatilities, the trader\nshould consider closing their position if the suspected breakout is not in their favor.\nThe potential break is likely to work in the favor of the trader if the current spot\nis close to the limit and far from the stop. In this hypothetical situation, it may be\nproﬁtable to move limit prices away from current spot prices to increase proﬁts\nfrom the potential break. If the spot price is close to the stop price and far from the\nlimit price, the break is likely to work against the trader, and the trader should close\nhis or her position immediately.\nBreakout traders can monitor volatilities to verify a breakout. If traders suspect\na breakout, he or she can verify this breakout though implied volatilities. Should\nimplied volatility be constant or rising, there is a higher probability that the currency\nwill continue to trade in range than if vola tility is low or falling. In other words,\nbreakout traders should look for short-term volatilities to be signiﬁcantly lower than\nlong-term volatilities before making a breakout trade.\nAside from being a key component for pricing, option volatilities can also be\na useful tool for forecasting market activities. Option volatilities measure the rate\nand magnitude of the changes in a currency’ s prices. Implied option volatilities, on\nthe other hand, measure the expected ﬂuctuation of a currency’s price over a given\nperiod of time based on historical ﬂuctuations.\n■Tracking Volatilities on Your Own\nVolatility tracking typically involves taking the historic annual standard deviation of\ndaily price changes. Generally speaking, we use three-month volatilities for long-\nterm volatilities numbers and one-month volatilities for the short term. Volatilities\ncan be found on Bloomberg or Reuters.\nThe next step is to start compiling a list of data with the date, currency pair price,\nimplied one-month volatility, and implie d three-month volatility for the various\ncurrency pairs in Excel. It might also be beneﬁcial to ﬁnd the difference between the\none-month and three-month volatilities to look for large differentials or to calculate\none-month volatility as a percentage of three-month volatility.\nOnce a sufﬁcient amount of data is compiled, one can graph the data as a visual\naid. The graph should use two y-axes, with spot prices on one and short- and\nlong-term volatilities on the other. If desired, the differences in short- and long-term\nvolatilities can be graphed as well in a separate, single y-axis graph.\n195CHAPTER 25\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nIntervention\nIntervention by central banks is one of the most important short- and long-term\nfundamentally driven market movers for the currency market. For short-term\ntraders, intervention can lead to sharp intraday movements on the scale of 150–250\npips in a matter of minutes. For longer-term traders, intervention can signal a\nsigniﬁcant change in trend because it suggests that the central bank is shifting or\nsolidifying its stance and sending a message to the market that they are backing certain\ndirectional move in their currency. There are basically two types of intervention:\nsterilized and unsterilized. Sterilized intervention requires offsetting intervention\nwith the buying or selling of government bonds while unsterilized intervention\ninvolves no changes to the monetary base to offset intervention. Many argue that\nunsterilized intervention has a more lasting effect on the currency than sterilized\nintervention.\nTaking a look at some of the following case studies, it is apparent that interventions\nin general are important to watch and can have large impacts on a currency pair’s\nprice action. Although the actual timing of an intervention tends to be a surprise,\nquite often the market will begin talking about the need for intervention days or\nweeks before the actual intervention occurs. The direction of an intervention is\nalmost always known in advance because the central bank will typically come across\nthe newswires complaining about too much strength or weakness in their currency.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION196These warnings give traders a window of opportunity to participate in what could\nbe signiﬁcant proﬁt potentials or to stay out of the markets. The only thing to watch\nout for, which you will see in our case study is that the sharp intervention based\nrallies or selloffs can quickly be reversed as speculators come into the market to\n‘‘fade the central bank.’’ Whether or not the market fades, the central bank depends\non the frequency of central bank intervention, the success rate, the magnitude of\nthe intervention, the timing of the intervention, and whether fundamentals support\nintervention. Intervention is much more prevalent in emerging market currencies\nthan in the G7 currencies because these countries need to prevent their local\ncurrencies from appreciating too signiﬁcantly such that it would hinder economic\nrecovery and reduce the competitiveness of the country’s exports. Nonetheless, G7\ninterventions will happen and its rarity is exactly what makes them signiﬁcant.\n■Japan\nIn the past two decades, the central bank most willing to engage intervention is the\nBank of Japan. As an export dependent country, a strong yen poses a major risk to\nthe export sector. While the Bank of Japan conducts the intervention, the decision\nis made by the Ministry of Finance. The most recent case of intervention by the\nJapanese gover nment was in 2011. The BoJ largely s tayed out of the market between\n2012 and 2015 because Abenomics helped to drive a recovery in the economy. On\nOctober 31, 2011, USDJPY hit a record low, which means that the Japanese yen hit\na record high. Frustrated with the currency’s strength after the 2011 earthquake and\ntsunami, the Japanese government came into the forex market aggressively to sell\nthe yen and buy the dollar. On that day, their intervention efforts drove USDJPY\nfrom a low of 75.575 to a high of 79.50, almost 400 pips. As shown in Figure 25.1,\n90% of this move happened in the ﬁrst 35 minutes.\n75.0076.0077.0078.0079.0080.00\n14:00\n16:26\n17:56\n19:27\n21:01\n22:32\n0:03\n1:34\n3:09\n4:40\n6:11\n7:42\n9:29\n17:18\n1:24\n9:29\n17:37\n1:42\n9:48\n17:37\n2:01\n10:06USDJPY Oct 31, 2011\nFIGURE 25.1 USDJPY Chart\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION197The Bank of Japan also bought USDJPY in August 2011, but one of their biggest\nintervention programs was in March 2011, when central banks around the world\njoined the BoJ to sell the yen as a sign of solidarity after an earthquake and tsunami\ndrove the currency to a record high. On that day, intervention only drove USDJPY\nfrom 79.18 to 82, but a few weeks later it hit a high of 85.50, as shown in Figure 25.2.\nThe Bank of Japan also intervened in September 2015 and as shown in Figure 25.3,\na daily chart, USDJPY jumped nearly 300 pips that day. Typically, USDJPY will\nmove 75 to 150 pips on an average day, so a 300-pip move that happens in minutes\nis signiﬁcant. In all but one of these four cases, the intervention move was reversed\nalmost immediately. The only reason why USDJPY extended its rally in March 2011\nwas because the intervention was coordinated with other central banks, making it\nmore powerful.\nWhile the Japanese government has been quieter in recent years, they were\nvery active in the early twenty-ﬁrst cen tury. The frequency and strength of BoJ\nintervention during this period created an invisible ﬂoor under USDJPY. Although\nthere has been no more mention of this ﬂoor in recent years, the BoJ/MoF instilled\nenough fear that intervention is always a worry. This fear is well justiﬁed because in\nthe event of BoJ intervention, the average 100-pip daily range can easily triple.\nJapanese intervention can be traded one of two ways—ride the move on the\nday of intervention or fade it in the days that follow. The key is not to be greedy,\nbecause the Japanese government can always step in again. Committing to take a\nsolid 100-pip proﬁt (of a 150–200 pip move) or using a very short-term intraday\ntrailing stop of 15–20 pips, for example, can be helpful.\n■Switzerland\nThe Swiss National Bank’s 1.20 EURCHF ﬂoor is another form of intervention.\nFaced with a high level of uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued\ncurrency, and deﬂation risks in 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange\nrate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At the time, they pledged to sell francs in an unlimited\nquantity to maintain the peg. The goal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping\nthe gain in the franc. As shown in Figure 25.4, the peg was very effective in keeping\nEURCHF above 1.20 between late 2012 an d 2014. However, in January 2015, the\nprospect of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank pushed the SNB to\nabandon their peg, and their surprise announcement caused a 30% one-day decline\nin EURCHF. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\nOther central banks have also intervened in their currency in the past decade\nincluding the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

They have only\nintervened a few times before, the most recent of which was in 2000. The ECB\ncame into the market to buy euros when the single currency dropped from 90 cents\nto 84 cents. In January 1999, when the euro was ﬁrst launched it was valued at\n1.17 against the U.S. dollar. Due to the sharp slide, the European Central Bank\n(ECB) convinced the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada to\njoin them in coordinated intervention to prop up the euro for the ﬁrst time ever.\nThe Eurozone felt concerned that the market was lacking conﬁdence in their new\ncurrency but also feared that the slide in their currency was increasing the cost of the\nregion’s oil imports. With energy prices hitting 10-year highs at the time, Europe’s\nheavy dependence on oil imports necessitated a stronger currency. The U.S. agreed\nto intervention because buying euros and selling dollars would help to boost the\nvalue of European imports and aid in the funding of an already growing U.S. trade\ndeﬁcit. Tokyo joined in the intervention because they were becoming concerned\nthat the weaker euro was posing a threat to their own exports.

For trading purposes, this would have given traders an opportunity\nto buy euros in anticipation of intervention or to avoid shorting the EURUSD.\nFigure 25.5 shows the price action of the EURUSD on the day of intervention.\nUnfortunately, there is no minute data available dating back to September 2000,\nbut from the daily chart, we can see that on the day that the ECB intervened in the\neuro (September 22, 2000), with the help of its trade partners, the EURUSD had a\nhigh-low range of over 400 pips.\nEven though intervention does not happen often, it is a very important fundamental\ntrading strategy because each time it occurs, price movements are substantial.\nFor traders, intervention has three major implications for trading:\n1.Bet on intervention : Heed the warnings from central bank ofﬁcials and use it as\na signal for possible intervention—the invisible ﬂoor created by the Japanese\ngovernment gave USDJPY bulls plenty of opportunity to pick short-term\nbottoms.\n2.Avoid betting against intervention : Betting against intervention can be dangerous\nbecause one bout of intervention by a central bank could easily trigger a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION201EURUSD (September 2000)\n0.91\n0.90\n0.89\n0.88\n0.87\n0.86\n0.85\n0.84\n09/01/2000 09/03/2000 09/05/2000 09/07/2000 09/09/2000 09/11/2000 09/13/2000 09/15/2000 09/17/2000 09/19/2000 09/21/2000 09/23/2000 09/25/2000 09/27/2000 09/29/2000 10/01/2000 10/03/2000\nFIGURE 25.5 EURUSD Intervention\nsharp 100–150 plus pip move in the currency pair, taking out stop orders and\nexacerbating the move.\n3.Use stops when intervention is a risk : With the 24-hour nature of the market,\nintervention can occur at any time of the day.

        "203CHAPTER 26\nCurrency Proﬁles\nand Outlook\nIn order to understand how to trade currencies effectively, it is important to have\na ﬁrm grasp of the general economic characteristics of the most commonly traded\ncurrencies. This includes understanding which economic reports and factors have the\nmost signiﬁcant impact on a currency’s movements. For example, some currencies\nare extremely sensitive to commodity price movements and others are not. Learn-\ning the characteristics or personalities of each currency will help traders understand\nwhat factors inﬂuence the exchange rate on a short- and long-term basis. We will\nlook at the eight most actively traded currencies—the U.S. dollar, euro, British\npound, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian\ndollars. Of course, the most important currency of them all is the U.S. dollar.\n■Currency Proﬁle: U.S. Dollar (USD)\nBroad Economic Overview\nThe United States is the world’s leading economic power, with gross domestic\nproduct valued at over US$17 trillion as of 2014. This is the highest in the world,\nand based on the purchasing power parity model, it is four times the size of Japan’s\noutput, ﬁve times the size of Germany’s, and seven times the size of the United\nKingdom’s. The United States is primarily a service-oriented country, with nearly\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK20480% of its GDP coming from real estate, transportation, ﬁnance, health care, and\nbusiness services. Yet, the sheer size of th e U.S. manufacturing sector still makes\nthe U.S. dollar particularly sensitive to developments in the manufacturing sector.\nWith the United States having the largest and most liquid equity and ﬁxed income\nmarkets in the world, foreign investors have consistently increased their purchases\nof U.S. assets. According to the IMF, fore ign direct investments into the U.S. are\nequal to approximately 40% of total global net inﬂows for the United States. On a\nnet basis, the United States absorbs 71% of total foreign savings. This means that if\nforeign investors are not satisﬁed with th eir returns in the U.S. asset markets and\nthey decide to repatriate their funds, this would have a signiﬁcant effect on U.S.\nasset values and the U.S. dollar. More speciﬁcally, if foreign investors sell their\nU.S. dollar denominated assets holdings in search of higher yielding assets elsewhere,\nthis would typically result in a decline in the value of the U.S. asset, as well as the\nU.S. dollar.\nThe import and export volume of the United States also exceeds that of any other\ncountry. This is due to the country’s sheer size, as true import and export volume\nrepresent a mere 12% of GDP. Despite this large activity, on a netted basis, the\nUnited States is running a very large current account deﬁcit of over $113 billion as\nof Q4 2014. This is a major problem that the U.S. economy has been struggling\nwith for decades, as the large current account deﬁcit makes the U.S. dollar highly\nsensitive to changes in capital ﬂows. In fact, in order to prevent a decline in the U.S.\ndollar as a result of trade, the United States needs to attract a signiﬁcant amount\nof capital inﬂows per day. Thankfully, the U.S. bond market is the largest in the\nworld, and Treasuries remain an attractive investment due to the lack of suitable\nalternatives.\nMost major economies also count the United States as its largest trading partner,\nwith U.S. trade representing 20% of tota l world trade. These rankings are very\nimportant because changes in the value of the dollar and its volatility will impact the\nU.S. trading activities with these respective countries. More speciﬁcally, a weaker\ndollar will encourage more U.S. exports, whereas a stronger dollar could curb\nforeign demand for American goods. However, since the United States is not a\ntrade-dependent economy, the strength of a dollar is less troublesome. Here’s a\nbreakdown of the most important trading partners for the United States, in order of\nimportance:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Canada\n2. Mexico\n3. China\n4. European Union\n5. Japan\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK205Leading Import Sources\n1. China\n2. Canada\n3. Mexico\n4. European Union\n5. Japan\nSource: US Trade.gov 2014\nMonetary and Fiscal Policy Makers—The Federal Reserve\nThe Federal Reserve Board (Fed) is the monetary policy authority of the United\nStates. The Fed is responsible for setting and implementing monetary policy. The\nboard consists of a 12-member Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The\nvoting members of the FOMC are the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board,\nplus ﬁve presidents of the 12 district reserve banks. The FOMC holds eight meetings\nper year, which are widely watched for interest rate announcements or changes in\ngrowth expectations. After four of those meetings, the head of the Central Bank\nholds a press conference, and typically that is when major monetary policy changes\nare made.\nThe Fed has a high degree of independence to set monetary authority. They are\nless subject to political inﬂuences, as most members are accorded long terms that\nallow them to remain in ofﬁce through periods of alternate party dominance in both\nthe presidency and Congress.\nThe Federal Reserve issues a biannual Monetary Policy Report in February and\nJuly followed by the Humphrey–Hawkins testimony where the Federal Reserve\nchairman responds to questions from both the Congress and the Banking Committees\nin regards to this report. This report is important to watch, as it contains the FOMC\nforecasts for GDP growth, inﬂation, and unemployment.\nThe Fed, unlike most other central banks, has a mandate or ‘‘long-run objectives’’\nof ‘‘price stability and sustainable economic growth.’’ In order to adhere to these\ngoals, the Fed has to use monetary policy to limit inﬂation and unemployment\nand achieve balanced growth. The most popular tools that the Fed uses to control\nmonetary policy include the following.\nOpen Market Operations\nOpen market operations involve Fed purchases of government securities, including\nTreasury bills, notes and bonds. This is one of the most popular methods for\nthe Fed to signal and implement policy changes. Generally speaking, increases in\nFed purchases of government securities decreases interest rates, while selling of\ngovernment securities by the Fed boosts interest rates.\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK206Fed Funds Target\nThe Fed Funds target rate is the key policy target of the Federal Reserve. It is\nthe interest rate for borrowing that the Fed offers to its member banks. The Fed\ntends to increase this rate to curb inﬂation or decrease this rate to promote growth\nand consumption. Changes to this rate are closely watched by the market and tend\nto imply major changes in policy and will typically have large ramiﬁcations for\nglobal ﬁxed income and equity markets. The market also pays particular attention\nto the statement released by the Federal Reserve as it can offer guidance for future\nmonetary policy actions.\nFiscal policy is in the hands of the U.S. Treasury. Fiscal policy decisions include\ndetermining the appropriate level of taxes and government spending. In fact,\nalthough the markets pay more attention to the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury\nis the actual government body that determines dollar policy. That is, if they feel\nthat the USD rate on the foreign exchange market is under- or overvalued, the\nU.S. Treasury is the government body that gives the NY Federal Reserve Board the\nauthority and instructions to intervene in the foreign exchange market by physically\nselling or buying USD. Therefore, the Treasury’s view on dollar policy and changes\nto that view can be important to the currency market.\nOver the past few decades, the Treasury and Fed ofﬁcials have maintained a\n‘‘strong dollar’’ bias. While a weak dollar helps to promote growth for political\nreasons, the government is unlikely to change their stance in support of a weak\ndollar policy.\nImportant Characteristics of the U.S. Dollar\n■Over 80% of all currency deals involve the dollar . The most liquid currencies in the\nforeign exchange market are the EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, and USDCHF.\nThese currencies represent the most commonly traded currencies in the world,\nand it is no coincidence that all of these currency pairs involve the U.S. dollar. In\nfact, 80% of all currency deals, which include currency conversion, hedging, and\ntrade settlement, involve the U.S. dolla r. This explains why U.S. data, the U.S.\ndollar, and U.S. fundamentals are so important to foreign exchange traders.\n■Prior to the introduction of the euro and the g rowing utilization of t he Chinese renminbi,\nthe U.S. dollar was considered one the world’s p remier ‘‘safe-haven’’ reserve currencies .T h e\nU.S. dollar has long been one of the world’s premier ‘‘safe-haven’’ currencies, with\n76% of global currency reserves held in dollars. To this day, the dollar is still the\npreferred currency of choice, but in recent years its safe haven, reserve currency\nstatus has been challenged by the euro and Chinese renminbi. We are still a very\nlong way from the dollar being usurped by either currency, but in the past decade,\nmany central banks have slowly diversiﬁed their reserves by reducing their dollar\nholdings and increasing their euro and renminbi holdings. This trend will only\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK207accelerate in the years to come, but until European and Chinese bond markets are\nlarge and developed enough to handle the reserve diversiﬁcation ﬂows, the dollar\nand U.S. Treasuries will still be the inv estment of choice for reserve managers.\n■The U.S. dollar moves in the opposite direction of gold prices . One of the unique\ncharacteristics of the U.S. dollar is that there is a strong inverse relationship\nbetween the price of gold and the value of the U.S. dollar as shown in Figure 26.1.\nThese two instruments are near-perfect mirror images of each other, which means\nthat when the value of the dollar declines, the price of gold rises; and when the\ndollar appreciates, the price of gold falls. There is, of course, a good reason—gold\nis priced in U.S. dollars. The correlation is not perfect—in times of geopolitical\nuncertainty, investors generally prefer hard versus ﬁat currencies or gold versus\nthe dollar.\n■Many emerging market countries ‘‘peg’ ’ their local currencies to the dollar . Pegging a\ncurrency to the dollar refers to the idea that a government agrees to maintain their\ncurrency at a speciﬁc rate or range to the U .S. dollar. As the value of the dollar\nchanges, this requires the central bank to buy or sell their local currency and\nthe U.S. dollar to maintain the peg. For example, let’s imagine that Country A\npledges to maintain a ﬁxed currency peg of 7.5 versus the U.S. dollar. If the dollar\nweakens, causing downward pressure on the exchange rate, the central bank\nwould have to buy U.S. dollars and sell their local currency to maintain the peg.\nAfter buying dollars, they would typically invest those funds into U.S. Treasuries.\nDollar Index vs. Gold\n2000\n1900\n1800\n1700\n1600\n1500\n1400\n1300\n1200\n1100\n1000\n2/19/10 2/19/11 2/19/12\nGold Dollar2/19/13 2/19/14 2/19/15105\n100\n95\n90\n85\n80\n75\n70\nFIGURE 26.1 Dollar Index vs. Gold\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK208This process is exactly how China and other Asian economies became large\nholders of US Treasuries. Through the years, many countries have switched from\na ﬁxed to ﬂoating rate peg and in some cases a peg that references a basket of\ncurrencies, but in each case, the dollar is still the leading component. However,\nthe movement from ﬁxed U.S. dollar pegs to a basket reduces the amount of\ndollars that a country like China needs to buy, and as their currency regime and\nothers in the region are loosened further, the impact on the dollar will grow.\n■Interest rate differentials between U.S. Tr easuries and foreign bonds strongly followed .T h e\ninterest rate differenti als between U.S. Treasuries and foreign bonds are a very\nimportant relationship that professional FX traders need to follow. It can be a\nstrong indicator of potential currency movements because the U.S. market is one\nof the largest markets in the world, and investors are very sensitive to the yields\nthat the offered by U.S. assets. Large investors are constantly looking for assets\nwith the highest yields. As yields in the U.S. decrease or if yields abroad increase,\nthis would induce investors to sell their U.S. assets and purchase foreign assets.\nSelling U.S. ﬁxed income or equity assets would inﬂuence the currency market\nbecause that would require selling U.S. dollars and buying the foreign currency.\nIf U.S. yields rise or foreign yields decrease, investors in general would be more\ninclined to purchase U.S. assets, therefore boosting the value of the dollar (USD).\n■Keep an eye on the dollar index . Market participants closely follow the U.S. dollar\nindex as a gauge of overall dollar strength or weakness. The USD index is a\nfutures contract traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) that is calculated\nusing the trade-weighted geometric average of six currencies. It is important to\nfollow this index because when market participants are reporting general dollar\nweakness or a decline in the trade-weighted dollar, they are typically referring to\nthis index. Unfortunately, the weighting does not accurately reﬂect U.S. trade\nactivity. Nonetheless, the DXY is closely followed and actively traded. Also,\neven though the dollar may have moved signiﬁcantly against a single currency, it\nmay have not moved as signiﬁcantly on a trade-weighted basis. This is important\nbecause some central bankers may choose to focus on the trade-weighted index\ninstead of the individual currency pair’s performance against the dollar.\n■The dollar is impacted by equities and Treasuries . In earlier chapters, we have\nestablished that there is a strong corre lation between a country’s equity and\nﬁxed-income markets and its currency: If the equity market is rising, generally\nspeaking, foreign investment dollars should be coming in to seize the opportunity.\nIf equity markets are falling, domestic investors will be selling their shares of local\ncompanies and looking for opportunities abroad. With ﬁxed-income markets,\neconomies boasting the most valuable ﬁxed income opportunities with the highest\nyields will be capable of attracting more foreign investment. Daily ﬂuctuations\nand developments in any of these markets reﬂect movement of foreign portfolio\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK209investments, which would require foreign exchange transactions. Cross border\nmerger and acquisition activities can also inﬂuence the price action of currencies.\nLarge M&A deals, particularly those that involve a signiﬁcant cash portion, will\nhave a notable impact on the currency markets. The reason is that the acquirer\nwill need to buy or sell dollars to fund their cross-border acquisition.\nImportant Economic Indicators for the United States\nEconomic data is always important, but U.S. data tends to have the greatest impact\non currencies because more than 80% of currency transactions involve the U.S.\ndollar. Here are some of the most important and market moving pieces of U.S. data:\nEmployment: Nonfarm Payrolls\nThe employment report is the most important and widely watched indicator on the\neconomic calendar. Its importance is mostly due to political inﬂuences rather than\npure economic reasons, as the Fed is under strict pressure to keep unemployment\nunder control. As a result, interest rate policy is directly inﬂuenced by employment\nconditions. The monthly jobs report consists of data compiled from two different\nsurveys: the establishment survey and the household survey. The establishment\nsurvey provides data on nonf arm payroll employment, a verage hourly workweek,\nand the aggregate hours index. The household survey provides information on the\nlabor force, household employment, and the unemployment rate. When this report\nis released on the ﬁrst Friday of every month, forex traders will immediately hone\nin on the nonfarm payrolls number, the unemployment rate, and average hourly\nearnings. However, any revisions or seasonal adjustments can also impact the dollar’s\nreaction to the overall report.\nConsumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index is a key gauge of inﬂation. The index measures the prices\non a ﬁxed basket of consumer goods. Economists tend to focus more on the CPI-U\nor the core inﬂation rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy components.\nThe indicator is widely watched by the F X markets as it drives a lot of activity\nbecause job growth and inﬂation is the key to monetary policy.\nRetail Sales\nThe key to growth is consumer spending and for this reason, the retail sales report\nis also extremely market moving. The Retail Sales Index measures the total goods\nsold by a sampling of retail stores over the course of a month. This index is used as\na gauge of consumer consumption and consumer conﬁdence. The most important\nnumber to watch is retail sales less autos, as auto sales can vary month-to-month.\nWhile retail sales can be quite volatile due to seasonality, it is one of the most\nimportant indicators on the health of the economy along with a key input for GDP.\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK210Nonmanufacturing and Manufacturing ISM\nThe monthly nonmanufacturing and manufacturing reports released by the Institute\nfor Supply Management is also important because it generally provides the most\ncurrent information on activity in the economy. ISM releases a monthly composite\nindex based on surveys of 300 purchasing managers nationwide representing 20\ndifferent industries. An index value above 50 reﬂects expansion, while values below\n50 are indicative of contraction. The ISM nonmanufacturing index is particularly\nimportant because the United States is a services economy, and typically this report\nis released ahead of nonfarm payrolls; and the employment subcomponent can\nprovide early clues on the health of the labor market.\nConsumer Conﬁdence\nThe Consumer Conﬁdence Survey measures how individuals feel about the economy.\nThere are two popular reports—one released by the Conference Board and one\nby the University of Michigan. In the Conference Board survey, questionnaires\nare sent out to a nationwide representative sample of 5,000 households, of which\napproximately 3,500 respond. Households are asked ﬁve questions:\n1. A rating of business conditions in the household’s area\n2. A rating of business conditions in six months\n3. Job availability in the area\n4. Job availability in six months\n5. Family income in six months\nResponses are seasonally adjusted and an index is constructed for each response,\nand then a composite index is fashioned based on the aggregate responses. The\nUniversity of Michigan Survey, on the other hand, only polls 500 people, but since\nit is released before the Conference Board’s report, it can have a larger impact\non currencies. Rising c onsumer conﬁdence is viewed as a precursor to stronger\nconsumer spending and growth.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes in\nselling prices received by domestic producers for their output. PPI tracks changes\nin prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy, includ-\ning agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing, and\nmining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished goods\nPPI and how the index has reacted on a monthly, quarterly, and annualized basis.\nGross Domestic Product\nGross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure of the total production and\nconsumption of goods and services. In the United States, the Bureau of Economic\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK211Analysis (BEA) constructs two complementary measures of GDP, one based on\nincome and one based on expenditures. The advance release of GDP, which occurs\nthe month after each quarter ends, contains some BEA estimates for data not yet\nreleased, inventories and trade balance, and is the most important release. Other\nreleases of GDP, which are the revisions, are typically not very signiﬁcant unless a\nmajor change is made.\nInternational Trade\nThe balance of trade represents the di fference between exports and imports of\nforeign trade in goods and services. Merchandise data are provided for U.S. total\nforeign trade with all countries and details for trade with speciﬁc countries and\nregions of the world, as well as for individual commodities. Traders tend to focus\non seasonally adjusted trade numbers over a three-month period as single month\ntrade periods are regarded as volatile and less reliable.\nEmployment Cost Index (ECI)\nThe employment cost index data is based on a survey of employer payrolls in the\nthird month of the quarter for the pay period ending on the twelfth day of the\nmonth. This survey is a probability sample of approximately 3,600 private industry\nemployers and 700 state and local governments, public schools, and public hospitals.\nThe big advantage of ECI is that it includes nonwage costs, which adds as much\nas 30% to total labor costs. Reaction to the ECI, however, is often muted as it\nis generally very stable. It should be noted however that it is one of the Federal\nReserve’s favorite indicators.\nIndustrial Production\nThe Index of Industrial Production is a set of indexes that measures the monthly\nphysical output of U.S. factories, mines, and utilities. The index is broken down\nby industry type and market type. Foreign exchange markets focus mostly on the\nseasonally adjusted monthly change in aggregate ﬁgure. Increases in the index are\ntypically dollar positive.\nTreasury International Capital Flow Data (TIC Data)\nThe Treasury International Capital ﬂow data measures the amount of capital ﬂow\ninto the United States on a monthly basis. This economic release has become\nincreasingly important over the past few years since the funding of the U.S. deﬁcit\nis becoming more of an issue. Aside from the headline number itself, the market\nalso pays close attention to the ofﬁcial ﬂows, which represents the demand for U.S.\ngovernment debt by foreign central banks.",

It is\nthe interest rate for borrowing that the Fed offers to its member banks. The Fed\ntends to increase this rate to curb inﬂation or decrease this rate to promote growth\nand consumption. Changes to this rate are closely watched by the market and tend\nto imply major changes in policy and will typically have large ramiﬁcations for\nglobal ﬁxed income and equity markets. The market also pays particular attention\nto the statement released by the Federal Reserve as it can offer guidance for future\nmonetary policy actions.\nFiscal policy is in the hands of the U.S. Treasury. Fiscal policy decisions include\ndetermining the appropriate level of taxes and government spending. In fact,\nalthough the markets pay more attention to the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury\nis the actual government body that determines dollar policy. That is, if they feel\nthat the USD rate on the foreign exchange market is under- or overvalued, the\nU.S. Treasury is the government body that gives the NY Federal Reserve Board the\nauthority and instructions to intervene in the foreign exchange market by physically\nselling or buying USD. Therefore, the Treasury’s view on dollar policy and changes\nto that view can be important to the currency market.\nOver the past few decades, the Treasury and Fed ofﬁcials have maintained a\n‘‘strong dollar’’ bias. While a weak dollar helps to promote growth for political\nreasons, the government is unlikely to change their stance in support of a weak\ndollar policy.\nImportant Characteristics of the U.S. Dollar\n■Over 80% of all currency deals involve the dollar . The most liquid currencies in the\nforeign exchange market are the EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, and USDCHF.\nThese currencies represent the most commonly traded currencies in the world,\nand it is no coincidence that all of these currency pairs involve the U.S. dollar. In\nfact, 80% of all currency deals, which include currency conversion, hedging, and\ntrade settlement, involve the U.S. dolla r. This explains why U.S. data, the U.S.\ndollar, and U.S. fundamentals are so important to foreign exchange traders.\n■Prior to the introduction of the euro and the g rowing utilization of t he Chinese renminbi,\nthe U.S. dollar was considered one the world’s p remier ‘‘safe-haven’’ reserve currencies .T h e\nU.S. dollar has long been one of the world’s premier ‘‘safe-haven’’ currencies, with\n76% of global currency reserves held in dollars. To this day, the dollar is still the\npreferred currency of choice, but in recent years its safe haven, reserve currency\nstatus has been challenged by the euro and Chinese renminbi. We are still a very\nlong way from the dollar being usurped by either currency, but in the past decade,\nmany central banks have slowly diversiﬁed their reserves by reducing their dollar\nholdings and increasing their euro and renminbi holdings. This trend will only\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK207accelerate in the years to come, but until European and Chinese bond markets are\nlarge and developed enough to handle the reserve diversiﬁcation ﬂows, the dollar\nand U.S. Treasuries will still be the inv estment of choice for reserve managers.\n■The U.S. dollar moves in the opposite direction of gold prices . One of the unique\ncharacteristics of the U.S. dollar is that there is a strong inverse relationship\nbetween the price of gold and the value of the U.S. dollar as shown in Figure 26.1.\nThese two instruments are near-perfect mirror images of each other, which means\nthat when the value of the dollar declines, the price of gold rises; and when the\ndollar appreciates, the price of gold falls. There is, of course, a good reason—gold\nis priced in U.S. dollars. The correlation is not perfect—in times of geopolitical\nuncertainty, investors generally prefer hard versus ﬁat currencies or gold versus\nthe dollar.\n■Many emerging market countries ‘‘peg’ ’ their local currencies to the dollar . Pegging a\ncurrency to the dollar refers to the idea that a government agrees to maintain their\ncurrency at a speciﬁc rate or range to the U .S. dollar. As the value of the dollar\nchanges, this requires the central bank to buy or sell their local currency and\nthe U.S. dollar to maintain the peg. For example, let’s imagine that Country A\npledges to maintain a ﬁxed currency peg of 7.5 versus the U.S. dollar. If the dollar\nweakens, causing downward pressure on the exchange rate, the central bank\nwould have to buy U.S. dollars and sell their local currency to maintain the peg.\nAfter buying dollars, they would typically invest those funds into U.S. Treasuries.\nDollar Index vs. Gold\n2000\n1900\n1800\n1700\n1600\n1500\n1400\n1300\n1200\n1100\n1000\n2/19/10 2/19/11 2/19/12\nGold Dollar2/19/13 2/19/14 2/19/15105\n100\n95\n90\n85\n80\n75\n70\nFIGURE 26.1 Dollar Index vs. Gold\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK208This process is exactly how China and other Asian economies became large\nholders of US Treasuries. Through the years, many countries have switched from\na ﬁxed to ﬂoating rate peg and in some cases a peg that references a basket of\ncurrencies, but in each case, the dollar is still the leading component. However,\nthe movement from ﬁxed U.S. dollar pegs to a basket reduces the amount of\ndollars that a country like China needs to buy, and as their currency regime and\nothers in the region are loosened further, the impact on the dollar will grow.\n■Interest rate differentials between U.S. Tr easuries and foreign bonds strongly followed .T h e\ninterest rate differenti als between U.S. Treasuries and foreign bonds are a very\nimportant relationship that professional FX traders need to follow. It can be a\nstrong indicator of potential currency movements because the U.S. market is one\nof the largest markets in the world, and investors are very sensitive to the yields\nthat the offered by U.S. assets. Large investors are constantly looking for assets\nwith the highest yields. As yields in the U.S. decrease or if yields abroad increase,\nthis would induce investors to sell their U.S. assets and purchase foreign assets.\nSelling U.S. ﬁxed income or equity assets would inﬂuence the currency market\nbecause that would require selling U.S. dollars and buying the foreign currency.\nIf U.S. yields rise or foreign yields decrease, investors in general would be more\ninclined to purchase U.S. assets, therefore boosting the value of the dollar (USD).\n■Keep an eye on the dollar index . Market participants closely follow the U.S. dollar\nindex as a gauge of overall dollar strength or weakness. The USD index is a\nfutures contract traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) that is calculated\nusing the trade-weighted geometric average of six currencies. It is important to\nfollow this index because when market participants are reporting general dollar\nweakness or a decline in the trade-weighted dollar, they are typically referring to\nthis index. Unfortunately, the weighting does not accurately reﬂect U.S. trade\nactivity. Nonetheless, the DXY is closely followed and actively traded. Also,\neven though the dollar may have moved signiﬁcantly against a single currency, it\nmay have not moved as signiﬁcantly on a trade-weighted basis. This is important\nbecause some central bankers may choose to focus on the trade-weighted index\ninstead of the individual currency pair’s performance against the dollar.\n■The dollar is impacted by equities and Treasuries . In earlier chapters, we have\nestablished that there is a strong corre lation between a country’s equity and\nﬁxed-income markets and its currency: If the equity market is rising, generally\nspeaking, foreign investment dollars should be coming in to seize the opportunity.\nIf equity markets are falling, domestic investors will be selling their shares of local\ncompanies and looking for opportunities abroad. With ﬁxed-income markets,\neconomies boasting the most valuable ﬁxed income opportunities with the highest\nyields will be capable of attracting more foreign investment. Daily ﬂuctuations\nand developments in any of these markets reﬂect movement of foreign portfolio\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK209investments, which would require foreign exchange transactions. Cross border\nmerger and acquisition activities can also inﬂuence the price action of currencies.\nLarge M&A deals, particularly those that involve a signiﬁcant cash portion, will\nhave a notable impact on the currency markets. The reason is that the acquirer\nwill need to buy or sell dollars to fund their cross-border acquisition.\nImportant Economic Indicators for the United States\nEconomic data is always important, but U.S. data tends to have the greatest impact\non currencies because more than 80% of currency transactions involve the U.S.\ndollar. Here are some of the most important and market moving pieces of U.S. data:\nEmployment: Nonfarm Payrolls\nThe employment report is the most important and widely watched indicator on the\neconomic calendar. Its importance is mostly due to political inﬂuences rather than\npure economic reasons, as the Fed is under strict pressure to keep unemployment\nunder control. As a result, interest rate policy is directly inﬂuenced by employment\nconditions. The monthly jobs report consists of data compiled from two different\nsurveys: the establishment survey and the household survey. The establishment\nsurvey provides data on nonf arm payroll employment, a verage hourly workweek,\nand the aggregate hours index. The household survey provides information on the\nlabor force, household employment, and the unemployment rate. When this report\nis released on the ﬁrst Friday of every month, forex traders will immediately hone\nin on the nonfarm payrolls number, the unemployment rate, and average hourly\nearnings. However, any revisions or seasonal adjustments can also impact the dollar’s\nreaction to the overall report.\nConsumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index is a key gauge of inﬂation. The index measures the prices\non a ﬁxed basket of consumer goods. Economists tend to focus more on the CPI-U\nor the core inﬂation rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy components.\nThe indicator is widely watched by the F X markets as it drives a lot of activity\nbecause job growth and inﬂation is the key to monetary policy.\nRetail Sales\nThe key to growth is consumer spending and for this reason, the retail sales report\nis also extremely market moving. The Retail Sales Index measures the total goods\nsold by a sampling of retail stores over the course of a month. This index is used as\na gauge of consumer consumption and consumer conﬁdence. The most important\nnumber to watch is retail sales less autos, as auto sales can vary month-to-month.\nWhile retail sales can be quite volatile due to seasonality, it is one of the most\nimportant indicators on the health of the economy along with a key input for GDP.\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK210Nonmanufacturing and Manufacturing ISM\nThe monthly nonmanufacturing and manufacturing reports released by the Institute\nfor Supply Management is also important because it generally provides the most\ncurrent information on activity in the economy. ISM releases a monthly composite\nindex based on surveys of 300 purchasing managers nationwide representing 20\ndifferent industries. An index value above 50 reﬂects expansion, while values below\n50 are indicative of contraction. The ISM nonmanufacturing index is particularly\nimportant because the United States is a services economy, and typically this report\nis released ahead of nonfarm payrolls; and the employment subcomponent can\nprovide early clues on the health of the labor market.\nConsumer Conﬁdence\nThe Consumer Conﬁdence Survey measures how individuals feel about the economy.\nThere are two popular reports—one released by the Conference Board and one\nby the University of Michigan. In the Conference Board survey, questionnaires\nare sent out to a nationwide representative sample of 5,000 households, of which\napproximately 3,500 respond. Households are asked ﬁve questions:\n1. A rating of business conditions in the household’s area\n2. A rating of business conditions in six months\n3. Job availability in the area\n4. Job availability in six months\n5. Family income in six months\nResponses are seasonally adjusted and an index is constructed for each response,\nand then a composite index is fashioned based on the aggregate responses. The\nUniversity of Michigan Survey, on the other hand, only polls 500 people, but since\nit is released before the Conference Board’s report, it can have a larger impact\non currencies. Rising c onsumer conﬁdence is viewed as a precursor to stronger\nconsumer spending and growth.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes in\nselling prices received by domestic producers for their output. PPI tracks changes\nin prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy, includ-\ning agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing, and\nmining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished goods\nPPI and how the index has reacted on a monthly, quarterly, and annualized basis.\nGross Domestic Product\nGross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure of the total production and\nconsumption of goods and services. In the United States, the Bureau of Economic\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK211Analysis (BEA) constructs two complementary measures of GDP, one based on\nincome and one based on expenditures. The advance release of GDP, which occurs\nthe month after each quarter ends, contains some BEA estimates for data not yet\nreleased, inventories and trade balance, and is the most important release. Other\nreleases of GDP, which are the revisions, are typically not very signiﬁcant unless a\nmajor change is made.\nInternational Trade\nThe balance of trade represents the di fference between exports and imports of\nforeign trade in goods and services. Merchandise data are provided for U.S. total\nforeign trade with all countries and details for trade with speciﬁc countries and\nregions of the world, as well as for individual commodities. Traders tend to focus\non seasonally adjusted trade numbers over a three-month period as single month\ntrade periods are regarded as volatile and less reliable.\nEmployment Cost Index (ECI)\nThe employment cost index data is based on a survey of employer payrolls in the\nthird month of the quarter for the pay period ending on the twelfth day of the\nmonth. This survey is a probability sample of approximately 3,600 private industry\nemployers and 700 state and local governments, public schools, and public hospitals.\nThe big advantage of ECI is that it includes nonwage costs, which adds as much\nas 30% to total labor costs. Reaction to the ECI, however, is often muted as it\nis generally very stable. It should be noted however that it is one of the Federal\nReserve’s favorite indicators.\nIndustrial Production\nThe Index of Industrial Production is a set of indexes that measures the monthly\nphysical output of U.S. factories, mines, and utilities. The index is broken down\nby industry type and market type. Foreign exchange markets focus mostly on the\nseasonally adjusted monthly change in aggregate ﬁgure. Increases in the index are\ntypically dollar positive.\nTreasury International Capital Flow Data (TIC Data)\nThe Treasury International Capital ﬂow data measures the amount of capital ﬂow\ninto the United States on a monthly basis. This economic release has become\nincreasingly important over the past few years since the funding of the U.S. deﬁcit\nis becoming more of an issue. Aside from the headline number itself, the market\nalso pays close attention to the ofﬁcial ﬂows, which represents the demand for U.S.\ngovernment debt by foreign central banks."

        "213CHAPTER 27\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nEuro (EUR)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe European Union (EU) was developed as an institutional framework for the\nconstruction of a united Europe. As of May 2015, the EU consists of 28 member\ncountries with 19 of these nations sharing the euro as a common currency. The\nEurozone consists of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,\nGreece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,\nPortugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. With the exception of Denmark and the\nUnited Kingdom, other EU states are obliged to join the monetary union when they\nmeet the criteria to do so. Aside from a common currency, these countries also\nshare a single monetary policy dictated by the European Central Bank (ECB). These\ncommon currency countries constitute the European Monetary Union (EMU).\nThe EMU is the world’s second largest economic power, with gross domestic\nproduct valued at approximately US$18 trillion in 2014. With a highly developed\nﬁxed income, equity, and futures market, the EMU is the second most attractive\ninvestment market for domestic and international investors. In its early days, the\nEMU found difﬁculty attracting foreign direct investment or large capital ﬂows\nbecause, historically, the U.S. markets are larger with more consistent returns. As\na result, the U.S. absorbs 71% of total foreign savings. However, with the euro\nbecoming an established currency and the European Monetary Union incorporating\nmore members, the euro’s importance as a reserve currency is rising and translating\ninto greater capital ﬂows. The only problem is that European bond markets are\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)214fragmented, and there are not enough quality assets for central banks to invest in.\nUnless there are euro bonds, foreign central banks could be slow to diversify their\nreserve holdings. Nonetheless, they will do so gradually, providing ongoing support\nfor the euro.\nTrade is extremely important to Eurozone nations and most countries conduct\nthe majority of their trade with other states in the region. This is important because\none of the most valuable aspects of the euro is its facilitation of trade activity through\nthe elimination of exchange rate risk. Large Eurozone nations such as Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Spain also conduct signiﬁcant trade activity with countries like the\nUnited States and China. This makes the value of the euro particularly important\nto economic activity. A country like the United States is less sensitive to exchange\nrate ﬂuctuations because most of its demand is internal, but Europe is extremely\nsensitive to its exchange rate because many Eurozone nations rely on external\ndemand. The size and scope of the EMU’s trade with the rest of the world provides\nit with signiﬁcant power in the international trade arena. International clout is also\none of the primary goals in the formation of the European Union, because it allows\nindividual nations to negotiate as a group on an equal playing ﬁeld with the United\nStates and China, their two largest trading partners. The breakdowns of the most\nimportant trading partners for the European Union are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Switzerland\n4. Russia\n5. Turkey\nLeading Import Sources\n1. China\n2. Russia\n3. United States\n4. Norway\n5. Switzerland\nWhile trade is extremely important, the service sector has the largest share of\ntotal output followed by manufacturing. In fact, a large number of the companies\nwhose primary purpose is to produce ﬁnished products still concentrate their EU\nactivity on innovation, research, design, and marketing, while outsourcing most of\ntheir manufacturing activities to Asia.\nThe EU’s growing role in international trade has major implications for the role of\nthe euro as a reserve currency. As more countries conduct trade with the Eurozone,\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)215they will be motivated to accumulate more euros to reduce exchange risk and\ntransaction costs. Traditionally, most international trade transactions involve the\nBritish pound, the Japanese yen, and/or the U.S. dollar. Before the establishment of\nthe euro, it was unreasonable to hold large amounts of every individual EU national\ncurrency. As a result, currency reserves tended toward the dollar. At the end of the\n1990s, approximately 65% of all world reserves were held in U.S. dollars, but after\nthe introduction of the euro, foreign reserve assets slowly shifted towards the euro.\nThis trend will only continue as the world becomes more globalized.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nMakers—The European Central Bank\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is the governing body responsible for determining\nthe monetary policy of the countries participating in the EMU. The Executive Board\nof the EMU consists of the president of the ECB, the vice president of the ECB, and\nfour other members. These individuals, along with the governors of the national\ncentral banks, comprise the Governing Council. The ECB is set up such that the\nExecutive Board implements the policies dictated by the Governing Council. New\nmonetary policies decisions are typically made by majority vote, with the president\nhaving the casting vote in the event of a tie in their monthly meeting. After each\nmeeting the Central Bank president holds a press conference to answer questions.\nThis is also used as an opportunity to clarify their monetary policy stance.\nThe EMU’s primary objective is to maintain price stability and promote growth.\nMonetary and ﬁscal policy changes are made to ensure that this objective is met. With\nthe formation of the EMU, the Maastric ht Treaty was developed by the Union to\napply a number of criteria for each member country. These criteria were developed\nby the Union to help them achieve their objective. Deviations from these criteria\nby any one country will result in heavy ﬁnes. Listed below are the EMU criteria.\nIt is apparent based on these criteria that the ECB has a strict mandate focused on\ninﬂation and deﬁcit. Generally, the ECB strives to maintain annual growth in HCPI\n(Harmonized Consumer Price Index) below 2% and M3 (Money Supply) annual\ngrowth around 4.5%.\nThe EMU Criteria\nIn the 1992 Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) the following\npreconditions were created for any EU member state looking to join the economic\nand monetary union (EMU).\n■A rate of inﬂation no more than 1.5% above the average of the three best\nperforming member states, taking the average of the 12-month year-on-year rate\npreceding the assessment date.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)216■Long-term interest rates not exceeding the average rates of these low-inﬂation\nstates by more than 2% for the preceding 12 months.\n■Exchange rates which ﬂuctuate within the normal margins of the exchange-rate\nmechanism (ERM) for at least two years.\n■A general government debt/GDP ratio of not more than 60%, although a higher\nratio may be permissible if it is ‘‘sufﬁciently diminishing.’’\n■A general government deﬁcit not exceeding 3% of GDP, although a small and\ntemporary excess can be permitted.\nIf a country meets the convergence criteria and joins the EMU, their monetary\npolicy will be determined by the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB and the\nESCB (European System of Central Banks) are independent institutions from both\nnational governments and other EU institutions, granting them complete control\nover monetary policy. This operational independence is accorded to them as per\nArticle 108 of the Maastricht Treaty, which states that any member of the decision-\nmaking bodies cannot seek or take instructions from any Community Institutions,\nany government of a member state, or any other body. In other words, no one\ncountry can pressure the ECB into making a monetary policy change that is in only\ntheir best interest. The primary tools the ECB uses to control monetary policy is the\nfollowing.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe ECB has four main categories of open market operations to steer interest rates,\nmanage liquidity, and signal monetary policy stance. This includes:\n■Main reﬁnancing operations . These are regular liquidity-providing reverse transac-\ntions conducted weekly with a maturity o f two weeks, which provide the bulk of\nreﬁnancing to the ﬁnancial sector.\n■Longer-term reﬁnancing operations . These are liquidity-providing reverse transactions\nwith a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months, which provide\ncounterparties with additional longer-term reﬁnancing.\n■Fine-tuning operations . These are executed on an ad-hoc basis, with the aim of\nboth managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates, in\nparticular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected\nliquidity ﬂuctuations.\n■Structural operations . These involve the issuance of debt certiﬁcates, reverse trans-\nactions, and outright transactions. These operations will be executed whenever\nthe ECB wishes to adjust th e structural position of the Eurosystem vis-` a-vis the\nﬁnancial sector (on a regular or nonregular basis).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)217ECB Minimum Bid Rate (Repo Rate)\nThe ECB minimum bid rate is the key policy target for the ECB and the level of\nborrowing that the ECB offers to the central banks of its member states. This is also\nthe rate that is subject to change at the monthly ECB meetings. Since inﬂation is a\nmajor concern for European policy makers, they are generally more inclined to keep\ninterest rates at lofty levels to prevent inﬂation. Changes in the ECB’s minimum bid\nrate can have large ramiﬁcations for the EUR.\nThe ECB does not have an exchange rate target, but will factor in exchange rates\nin their policy deliberations because they can affect price stability. A high exchange\nrate lowers inﬂationary pressures while a low exchange rate promotes it. The ECB is\nnot prohibited from intervening in the foreign exchange markets if they believe that\ninﬂation is a concern. As a result, comments by members of the Governing Council\nare closely watched by forex traders and can have a signiﬁcant impact on the euro.\nIn addition to their monthly meetings, the Central Bank will also publish a\nmonthly bulletin and release staff forecasts and minutes from past meetings. The\npresident of the Central Bank holds a press conference after the policy meeting and\nthat, along with each of these event risk s, can cause volatility in the currency.\nNow let’s take a look at some of the important characteristics of the euro:\n■EURUSD cross is the most liquid and actively traded currency . The euro was introduced\nas an electronic currency in January 1999. At the time, the euro replaced all\npre-EMU currencies, except for Greece’s currency, which was converted to the\neuro in January 2001. As a result, the EURUSD cross is now the most liquid\ncurrency in the world and its movements are used as the primary gauge of the\nhealth of both the European and U.S. economies. Figure 27.1 highlights the\n10 year performance of EUR-USD. The euro is most frequently known as the\n‘‘anti-dollar’’ since dollar or U.S. fundamentals generally have a greater impact\non the movement of the currency.\nEURJPY and EURCHF are also very liquid currencies that can be used as a\ngauge of the health of the Japanese and Swiss economies. Many new traders will\nstart with the EURUSD because of its orderly movements, tight spread, and\nliquidity.\n■Euro: A currency without a country . One of the greatest problems of the euro is that it\nis currency without a country. Instead, it bears the economic, political, and social\nrisks of 19 different nations. This is its gr eatest strength and its greatest weakness.\nIn the past decade, we have seen how the debt crisis in smaller Eurozone nations\nhave affected the currency as a whole. It undermines conﬁdence and has, on many\noccasions, put the entire monetary union at risk.\n■Spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and 10-year Bunds can indicate euro sentiment .\nTen-year government bonds can serve as an important indicator of where the euro\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)218\nFIGURE 27.1 EURUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)219is headed, especially against the U.S. dollar. The differential between the 10-year\nU.S. government bond and the 10-year German Bund rates can provide a good\nindication for EURUSD’s movement. If Bund rates are higher than U.S. Treasury\nrates and the differential increases, or the spread widens, this is generally positive\nfor the EURUSD. Alternatively, a decrease in the differential or a tightening of\nthe interest rates is generally bearish for EURUSD. As there is no Euro bond,\nthe 10-year German Bund yield is typically used as the benchmark bond for the\nEurozone because Germany is the largest country in the monetary union.\n■Predictions for euro area money ﬂows . Another useful rate to follow is the three-month\ninterest rate, also known as the euro interbank offer rate or the Euribor rate. This\nis the rate offered from one large bank to another on interbank term deposits.\nTraders tend to compare the Euribor futures rate with the Eurodollar futures rate.\nEurodollars are deposits denominated in U.S. dollars at banks and other ﬁnancial\ninstitutions outside the United States. Because investors like high-yielding assets,\nEuropean ﬁxed-income assets become more attractive as the spread between\nEuribor futures and Eurodollar futures widens in favor of Euribors. As the spread\nnarrows, European assets become less attractive, whereby implying a potential\ndecrease in money ﬂows into the Euro.\nMergers and acquisition activity can also affect how the EURUSD moves.\nIn recent years we have seen increased M&A activity between EU and U.S.\nmultinationals. Large deals, especially with a large cash component, can lead to a\nsudden burst in the EURUSD, but the reaction is generally short-lived.\n■Important Indicators for the Euro\nWhen it comes to Eurozone economic reports, the only ones that affect the euro are\nGerman or Eurozone data. The largest countries in the Eurozone in order of GDP\ncontribution are Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. While French and Italian data\nare important, they rarely move the currency. So what forex traders should focus on\nare the broader regional reports and German data. Central bank rate decisions are\nthe most important, but here are some additional economic reports that can have\nmeaningful impact on the currency.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the Manufacturing\nand Service sectors. For the Eurozone, they provide this data for the four largest\neconomies and a composite index for the region. These numbers are extremely\nmarket moving because they provide the most up-to-date information on how each\nof the economies are performing in the current month and not how the economies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)220performed the previous month like many other reports. However, since the reports\nare for the current period, they are usually subject to revisions so the euro will\nmove on the preliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents\nexpansion, and a reading below 50 represents contraction. For the Eurozone, the\nmanufacturing PMI index is the most important along with the composite index,\nwhich aggregates how the manufacturing and service sector are performing. Since\nthe German data are released shortly before the Eurozone report, they can have a\ngreater impact on the currency.\nIFO Survey\nGermany is by far the largest economy in Europe and is responsible for approximately\n20% of total GDP. Any insight into German business conditions is seen as an insight\ninto Europe as a whole. The IFO is a monthly survey conducted by the IFO institute.\nThey survey over 7,000 German businesses, asking for their assessment of the\nGerman business climate and their short-term plans. The initial publication of the\nresults consists of the business climate headline ﬁgure and its two equally weighted\nsubindices: current business conditions and business expectations. The typical range\nis from 80 to 120, with a higher number indicating greater business conﬁdence. The\nreport is most valuable, however, when measured against previous data.\nInﬂation Indicators—HICP\nSince the ECB has an inﬂation mandate, the EU Harmonized Index of Consumer\nPrices (HICP) published by Eurostat is very important. This harmonized index is\ndesigned for international comparison as required by EU law. The index is compiled\nwith information on prices retrieved by each national statistical agency. Individual\ncountries are required to provide Eurostat with the 100 indices used to compute the\nHICP. The national HICPs are totaled by Eurostat as a weighted average of these\nsubindices, and the weights used are country-speciﬁc. The HICP is released at the\nend of the month following the reference period, which is about 10 days after the\npublications of the national CPIs from Spain and France, the ﬁnal EMU-5 countries\nto release their CPIs. Even if part of the information is already known when the\nHICP is released, it is an important release because it serves as the reference inﬂation\nindex for the ECB who aims to keep Eurozone consumer price inﬂation between\n0% and 2%.\nGerman Industrial Production\nIndustrial production data are seasonally adjusted (SA) and include a breakdown into\nfour major subcategories: mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction. The\nmanufacturing aggregate comprises four main product groups: basic and producer\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)221goods, capital goods, consumer durables, and consumer nondurables. The market\ntends to pay attention to the annual rate of change and the seasonally adjusted\nmonth-on-month ﬁgure. Germany’s ﬁgure is most important since it is the largest\ncountry in the Eurozone; however, the market can also react to the French industrial\nproduction report. The initial industrial production release is based on a narrower\ndata sample and hence subject to revision when the full sample has become available.\nThe ministry occasionally provides insight on the expected direction of the revision\nin the initial data release.\nGerman Unemployment\nLabor market numbers are important for every country and in the case of the\nEurozone, German unemployment is the most important. Released by the Labor\nOfﬁce, the data contain information on the number of unemployed, as well as\nthe changes on the previous month, on both seasonally (SA) and nonseasonally\n(NSA) adjusted terms. The NSA unemployment rate is provided, along with data\non vacancies, short-shift working arrangements, and the number of employees\n(temporarily suspended in 1999). Within an hour after the FLO release, the\nBundesbank releases the SA unemployment rate. The day ahead of the release,\nthere is often a leak of the ofﬁcial data from a trade-union source. The leak is\nusually of the NSA level of unemployment in millions. When a precise ﬁgure is\nreported on Reuters, as given by ‘‘sources’’ for the NSA level of unemployment,\nthe leak usually reﬂects t he ofﬁcial ﬁgures. Rumors often circulate up to one week\nbefore the ofﬁcial release, and they are notoriously imprecise. Regardless, a drop\nin unemployment along with an improvement in the jobless rate is positive for the\ncurrency, whereas a rise in jobless claims or increase in the unemployment rate is\nnegative for the currency.\nPreliminary GDP\nPreliminary GDP is issued when Eurostat has collected data from a sufﬁcient number\nof countries to produce an estimate. This usually includes France, Germany, and\nthe Netherlands. However, Italy is not included in the preliminary release and is\nonly added in the ﬁnal number. The yearly aggregates for EU-15 and EMU-11\nare a simple sum of national GDP. For the quarterly accounts, the aggregation is\nmore complex since some countries (Greece, Ireland, and Luxembourg) do not\nyet produce quarterly national accounts data. Moreover, Portugal produces only\npartial quarterly accounts with a signiﬁcant lag. Thus, both the EU-15 and EMU-11\nquarterly paths are the result of estimates from quarterly data based on a group of\ncountries accounting for more than 95% of total EU GDP (see the Foreword for a\ndetailed description of the weights of each country in the EU).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)222M3\nM3 is a broad measure of money supply, which includes everything from notes\nand coins to bank deposits. The ECB closely monitors M3 as they view it as a key\nmeasure of inﬂation. At its session in December 1998, the governing council of the\nECB set its ﬁrst reference value for M3 growth at 4.5%. This value supports inﬂation\nb e l o w2 % ,t r e n dg r o w t ho f2 %t o2 . 5 % ,a n dal o n g - t e r md e c l i n ei nt h ev e l o c i t y\nof money by 0.5% to 1%. The growth rate is monitored on a three-month moving\naverage basis in order to prevent monthly volatility to distort the information given\nby the aggregate. The ECB’s approach to monetary targeting leaves considerable\nroom for maneuver and interpretation. Because the ECB does not impose bands\non M3 growth, as the Bundesbank used to do, there will be no automatic action\nwhen M3 growth diverges from the reference value. Moreover, although the ECB\nconsiders M3 to be the key indicator, it will also take into account the changes in\nother monetary aggregates.\nIndividual Country Budget Deﬁcits\nThe Stability and Growth Pact states that budget deﬁcits for every country in the\nmonetary union must be kept below 3% of GDP. Failure to meet these targets will\nbe punished. However through the years many Eurozone nations have had deﬁcits\nin excess of 3% and penalties have not been enforced.\n223CHAPTER 28\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nBritish Pound (GBP)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe United Kingdom is the world’s ﬁfth largest economy with GDP valued at\napproximately US$3 trillion in 2014 according to the IMF. With one of the most\ndynamic central banks in the world, the UK economy beneﬁted from many years of\nstrong growth, low unemployment, expa nding output, and resilient consumption.\nThe strength of consumer consumption has been largely due to the strong housing\nmarket. The United Kingdom is a service-oriented economy, with manufacturing\nrepresenting an increasingly smaller portion of GDP, now equivalent to only one-\nﬁfth of national output. Their capital market system is one of the most developed\nin the world, with ﬁnance and banking being the strongest contributors to GDP.\nAlthough the majority of the UK’s GDP is from services, it is also one of the\nlargest producers and exporters of natural gas in the European Union. The energy\nproduction industry accounts for 10% of GDP, which is one of the highest shares of\nany industrialized nation. This is particularly important, as increases in energy prices\n(such as oil) will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt the large number of UK oil exporters. (The\nUnited Kingdom became a net oil importer for a brief period due to disruptions in\nthe North Sea in 2003, but it has already resumed its status as a net oil exporter.)\nOverall, the United Kingdom is a net importer of goods with a consistent\ntrade deﬁcit. Its largest trading partner is the EU, with trade between the two\nconstituencies accounting for over 50% of all of the country’s import and export\nactivities. The United States, on an individual basis, still remains the United\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)224Kingdom’s largest trading partner. The breakdowns of the most important trading\npartners for the United Kingdom are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. Germany\n3. Switzerland\n4. Netherlands\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Netherlands\n3. China\n4. United States\n5. France\nSince the launch of the euro in 1999, the single currency’s troubles have become\nincreasingly apparent, and this has made the UK’s decision to maintain its own\ncurrency and monetary authority increasingly intelligent. Yet the possibility of euro\nadoption will remain a question in the minds of pound traders for many years\nto come, although in 2015 into 2016, the more relevant question is whether the\nUnited Kingdom will remain in the EMU. A decision on euro entry has signiﬁcant\nramiﬁcations for the UK economy—the most important of which is that UK interest\nrates would have to be adjusted to reﬂect the equivalent interest rate of the Eurozone.\nOne of the primary arguments against adopting the euro is that the UK government\nhas sound macroeconomic policies that have worked very well for the country for\ndecades. Its successful monetary and ﬁscal policies have led it to outperform most\nmajor economies during economic downturns, including the European Union.\nThe UK Treasury has previously speciﬁed ﬁve economic tests that must be met\nprior to euro entry, which are the following:\nUK’s Five Economic Tests for Euro\n1. Is there sustainable convergence in business cycles and economic structures\nbetween the United Kingdom and other EMU members, so that the UK citizens\ncould live comfortably with euro interest rates on a permanent basis?\n2. Is there enough ﬂexibility to cope with economic change?\n3. Would joining the EMU create an environment that would encourage ﬁrms to\ninvest in the United Kingdom?\n4. Would joining the EMU have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the\nUK’s ﬁnancial services industry?\n5. Would joining the EMU be good for promoting stability and growth in\nemployment?\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)225The United Kingdom is a very political country where government ofﬁcials are\nhighly concerned with voter approval. If voters do not support euro entry, the\nlikelihood of EMU entry would decline. The following are some of the arguments\nfor and against adopting the euro:\nArguments in Favor of Adopting the Euro\n■There would be reduced exchange rate uncertainty for UK businesses and lower\nexchange rate transa ction costs or risks.\n■The prospect of sustained low inﬂation under the governance of the European\nCentral Bank should reduce long-term interest rates and stimulate sustained\neconomic growth.\n■Single currency promotes price transparency.\n■The integration of national ﬁnancial markets of the EU will lead to higher efﬁciency\nin the allocation of capital in Europe.\n■The euro is the second most important reserve currency after the USD.\n■With the United Kingdom joining the euro, the political clout of the EMU would\nincrease dramatically.\nArguments against Adopting the Euro\n■Currency unions have collapsed in the past.\n■Economic or political instabilities of one country would impact the Euro, which\nwould have exchange rate ramiﬁcations for otherwise healthy countries.\n■Strict EMU criteria outlined by the Stability and Growth Pact.\n■Entry would mean a permanent transfer of domestic monetary authority to the\nEuropean Central Bank.\n■Joining a currency union with no monetary ﬂexibility would require the United\nKingdom to have more ﬂexibility in the labor and housing markets.\n■There are fears about which countries might dominate the ECB.\n■Adjusting to new currency will require large transaction costs.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Bank\nof England\nFor the United Kingdom, the Bank of England (BoE) controls monetary policy, and\nthe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is a nine-member committee responsible\nfor setting interest rate policy in the United Kingdom. It consists of a governor,\ntwo deputy governors, two executive directors of the central bank, and four outside\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)226experts. The committee was granted operational independence in 1997, which\nmeans they won’t be inﬂuenced by the governing party. Despite this independence,\nmonetary policies have centered on achieving an inﬂation target dictated by the\nChancellor of the Treasury. Currently, this target is RPIX (Retail Price Index)\ninﬂation of 2.5%. The central bank has the power to change interest rates to levels\nthat will allow them to meet this target. The MPC holds monthly meetings, which\nare closely followed for announcements on changes in monetary policy, including\nchanges in the interest rate (bank repo rate). When no changes are made, no details\nare provided. In this case, the rate decision is generally a nonevent for the currency,\nwith traders shifting their focus to the minutes released two weeks later.\nThe MPC publishes statements after every meeting, along with a quarterly\nInﬂation Report that details the MPC’s two-year forecast for growth and inﬂation\nalong with justiﬁcation for policy movements. In addition, another publication,\ntheQuarterly Bulletin, provides information on past monetary policy movements\nand analysis of the international economic environment and its impacts on the UK\neconomy. All of these reports can provide guidance of future policy changes. The\nmain policy tools used by the MPC and BoE are the following.\nBank Repo Rate\nThis is the key rate used in monetary policy to meet the Treasury’s inﬂation target.\nThis rate is set for the Bank’s own operati ons in the market, such as its short-term\nlending activities. Changes to this rate affect the rates set by the commercial banks\nfor their savers and borrowers. In turn, this rate will affect spending and output in\nthe economy, and eventually costs and prices. An increase in this rate would imply\nan attempt to curb inﬂation and slow growth, while a decrease in this rate would be\naimed at stimulating growth and expansion.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe goal of open market operations is to implement changes in the bank repo rate,\nwhile assuring adequate liquidity in the market and continued stability in the banking\nsystem. This is reﬂective of the three main objectives of the BoE: maintaining the\nintegrity and value of the currency, maintaining the stability of the ﬁnancial system,\nand seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the United Kingdom’s ﬁnancial services.\nTo ensure liquidity, the Bank conducts daily open market operations to buy or sell\nshort-term government ﬁxed-income instruments. If this is not sufﬁcient to meet\nliquidity needs, the Bank would also conduct additional overnight operations.\nImportant Characteristics of the British Pound\n■GBPUSD is very liquid . The GBPUSD is one of the most liquid currencies in the\nworld, with 6% of all currency trading involving the British pound as either\nthe base or counter currency. It is also one of the three most liquid currencies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)227alongside EURUSD and USDJPY. One of the reasons for the currency’s liquidity\nis the country’s highly developed capital markets. Many foreign investors seeking\nopportunities other than the United States have sent their funds to the United\nKingdom for investment. In order to create these transactions, foreigners will\nneed to sell their local currency and buy British pounds.\n■GBP has three names . The UK’s currency has three names: the British pound,\nsterling, and cable. All of these are used interchangeably.\n■GBP is laden with speculators . At the time of publication, the British pound has one\nof the highest interest rates among the developed nations. Although Australia\nand New Zealand have higher interest rates, their ﬁnancial markets are not as\ndeveloped as that of the United Kingdom. As a result, many investors who already\nhave positions or are interested in initiating new carry trades positions frequently\nuse the GBP as the lending currency and will go long the pound against currencies\nsuch as the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. A carry trade involves\nbuying or lending a currency with a higher interest and selling or borrowing a\ncurrency with a lower interest rate. In recent years, carry trades have increased in\npopularity, which helped spur demand for the British pound. However, should the\ninterest rate yield differential bet ween the pound and other currencies narrow,\nan exodus of carry traders will increase volatility in the British pound.\n■Interest rate differentials between Gilt s and foreign bonds ar e closely followed . Interest rate\ndifferentials between UK Gilts—U.S. Tr easuries and UK Gilts and German Bunds\nare widely watched by FX market participants. Gilts versus Treasuries can be a\nbarometer of GBPUSD ﬂows, while Gilts versus Bunds can be used as a barometer\nfor EURGBP ﬂows. More speciﬁcally, these interest rate differentials indicate how\nmuch premium yield UK ﬁxed-income assets are offering over U.S. and European\n(German Bunds are usually used as a barometer for European yield) ﬁxed-income\nassets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders with indications of potential\ncapital ﬂow or currency movements, as global investors are always shifting their\ncapital in search of the assets with the highest yields. The United Kingdom can\nprovide these yields with the safety of having the same credit stability as the United\nStates.\n■Euro sterling futures can give indications for interest rate movements .S i n c et h eU K\ninterest rate or bank repo rate is the primary tool used in monetary policy, it is\nimportant to keep abreast of potential changes to the interest rate. Comments\nfrom government ofﬁcials is one way to gauge biases for potential rate changes,\nbut the Bank of England is one of the only central banks that requires members\nof the Monetary Policy Committee to publish their speciﬁc voting records.\nThis personal accountability indicates that comments by individual committee\nmembers represent their own opinions and not that of the BoE. Therefore,\nit is necessary to look for other indication of potential BoE rate movements.\nThree-month euro sterling futures reﬂect market expectations on euro sterling\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)228\nFIGURE 28.1 GBPUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\ninterest rates three months into the future. These contracts are also useful in\npredicting UK interest rate changes, which will ultimately affect the ﬂuctuations\nof the GBPUSD. Figure 28.1 illustrates 10 year performance of GBP-USD.\n■Comments on euro by UK politicians will impact the euro . Any speeches, remarks\n(especially from the Prime Minister or Treasury Chancellor), or polls in regards\nto the euro will impact currency trade. Indication of adoption of the euro tends\nto put downward pressure on GBP, while further opposition to euro entry will\ntypically boost the GBP. Reason being that in order for the GBP to come in line\nwith the euro, interest rates would have to decline and monetary policy would\nhave to be subjected to a foreign entity. A decrease in the interest rate would\ninduce carry trade investors to close their positions or sell pounds. The GBPUSD\nwould also decline because of the uncertainties involved with Euro adoption. The\nUK economy is performing very well under the direction of its current monetary\nauthority. The EMU is currently encountering many difﬁculties with member\ncountries breaching EMU criteria. With one monetary authority dictating 19\ncountries (plus UK would be 20), the EMU has yet to prove that they have\ndeveloped a monetary policy suitable for all member states.\n■GBP has positive correlation with energy prices . The UK houses some of the largest\nenergy companies in the world, including British Petroleum. Energy production\nrepresents 10% of GDP. As a result, the British pound tends to have a positive\ncorrelation with energy prices. Speciﬁcally, since many members of the EU\nimport oil from the United Kingdom, as oil prices increase, they will, in turn,\nhave to buy more pounds to fund their energy purchases. In addition, rises in the\nprice of oil will also beneﬁt the earnings of the nations’ energy exporters.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)229■GBP crosses . Although the GBP/USD is a more liquid currency than EURGBP,\nEURGBP is typically the leading gauge for GBP strength. The GBPUSD currency\npair tends to be more sensitive to U.S. developments, while EURGBP is a\nmore pure fundamental pound trade since Europe is Britain’s primary trade\nand investment partner. However, both currencies are naturally interdependent,\nwhich means movements in the EURGBP can affect movements in the GBPUSD.\nThe reverse is also true—that is, movements in GBPUSD will also affect trading\nin EURGBP. Therefore, it is important for pound traders to be consciously aware\nof the trading behavior of both currency pairs. The EURGBP rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURUSD divided by the GBPUSD rate. Small differences in\nthese rates are often exploited by market participants and quickly eliminated.\n■Important Economic Indicators\nfor the United Kingdom\nAll of the following indicators are important for the United Kingdom. However,\nsince the United Kingdom is primarily a service-oriented economy, it is particularly\nimportant to pay attention to service sector data.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the manufacturing,\nservice, and construction sectors. These numbers are extremely market moving\nbecause they provide the most up-to-date information on how each of the economies\nis performing in the current month and not how the economies performed\nthe previous month, like many other reports. However since the reports are for the\ncurrent period, they are usually subject to revisions, so the euro will move on the\npreliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents expansion, and a\nreading below 50 represents contraction. For the United Kingdom, the PMI services\nindex is the most important, along with the composite index, which aggregates how\nthe manufacturing and service sector are performing.\nEmployment Situation\nThe employment report is a monthly survey of the labor market conducted by\nthe Ofﬁce of National Statistics. The obj ectives of the survey are to divide the\nworking-age population into three separate classiﬁcations (employed, unemployed,\nand not in the labor force), and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of\nthese categories. Data from the survey provide market participants with information\non major labor market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors,\nhours worked, labor force participation, and unemployment rates. The timeliness\nof the survey makes it a closely watched s tatistic by the currency market as it is a\ngood barometer of the strength of the UK economy and an important input into\nmonetary policy.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)230Retail Sales\nThe key to growth is consumer spending, and for this reason, the retail sales report\nis also extremely market moving. The Retail Sales Index measures the total goods\nsold by a sampling of retail stores over the course of a month. This index is used as\na gauge of consumer consumption and consumer conﬁdence. While retail sales can\nbe quite volatile due to seasonality, it is one of the most important indicators on the\nhealth of the economy, along with a key input for GDP.\nConsumer or Retail Price Index\nCPI or RPI is a measure of the change in prices of a basket of consumer goods. The\nmarkets however focus on the underlying RPI or RPI-X, which excludes mortgage\ninterest payments. The RPI-X is closely watc hed as the treasury sets inﬂation targets\nfor the BoE, currently deﬁned as 2.5% annual growth in RPI-X.\nGDP\nGDP is a quarterly report conducted by the Bureau of Statistics. GDP is a measure\nof the total production and consumption of goods and services in the UK. GDP\nis measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses, government, and\nnet foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert output measured\nat current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used to gauge where in\nthe business cycle the United Kingdom ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is perceived\nas inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or weak\ngrowth.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures the change in output in the United\nKingdom of manufacturing; mining and quarrying; and electricity, gas, and water\nsupply. Output refers to the physical quantity of items produced, unlike sales value,\nwhich combines quantity and price. The index covers the production of goods and\npower for domestic sales in the United Kingdom and for export. Because IP is\nresponsible for close to a quarter of gross domestic product, IP is widely watched as\nit can provide good insight into the current state of the economy.\nUK Housing Starts\nHousing starts measures the number of residential building construction projects\nthat have begun during any particular month. This is important for the United\nKingdom as the housing market is the primary industry that sustains the economy.\n231CHAPTER 29\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nSwiss Franc (CHF)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nSwitzerland is the twentieth largest economy in the world, with a GDP valued at\nover US$685 billion as of 2014. Although the economy is relatively small, it is one of\nthe wealthiest in the world on a GDP per capita basis. The country is prosperous and\ntechnologically advanced with economic and political stability that rivals many larger\neconomies. The country’s prosperity stems primarily from technological expertise\nin manufacturing, tourism, and banking. More speciﬁcally, Switzerland is known for\ntheir chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, machinery, precision instruments,\nwatches, and a ﬁnancial system historically known for protecting the conﬁdentiality\nof its investors. This coupled with the country’s lengthy history of political neutrality\nearned Switzerland the Swiss franc safe haven status and as a direct result of that,\nit is the one world’s most popular destinations for offshore capital. Even when the\ncentral bank introduced a temporary 1.20 EURCHF peg and lowered interest rates\nto negative levels, Switzerland stil l managed to attract safe haven ﬂows.\nIt is estimated that Switzerland holds over US$2 trillion in offshore assets as of\n2014 and attracts over 35% of the world’s private wealth management business.\nA large and highly advanced banking and insurance industry has developed to support\nthis demand, and the sector employs over 50% of the population and comprises over\n70% of total GDP. Since Switzerland’s ﬁnancial industry thrives on its safe haven\nstatus and renowned conﬁdentiality, capital ﬂows tend to drive the economy during\ntimes of global risk aversion, while trade ﬂows drive the economy in a risk-seeking\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)232environment. Trade ﬂows are extremely important, with nearly two thirds of all\ntrade conducted with Europe. With this in mind, Switzerland’s most important\ntrading partners a re the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Germany\n2. India\n3. United States\n4. Hong Kong\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Italy\n3. United States\n4. France\n5. China\nTraditionally, Switzerland has a strong trade and current account surplus that\nlends support to the currency. Most of the surplus can be attributed to the large\namount of foreign direct investment into the country, in seek of safety of capital,\ndespite the low to negative yields offered by Switzerland.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Swiss\nNational Bank\nMonetary policy in Switzerland is determined by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). They\nare a completely independent authority with a three-person committee responsible\nfor determining monetary policy. This committee consists of a chairman, a vice\nchairman, and one other (member) who constitute the Governing Board of the\nSNB. Due to the small size of the committee, all decisions are based on a consensus\nvote. The Board reviews monetary policy at least once a quarter, but decisions on\nmonetary policy can be made and announced at any point in time. Unlike most other\ncentral banks, the SNB does not set one ofﬁcial interest rate target, but instead sets\na target range for their three-month Swiss Libor rate.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nIn December of 1999, the SNB shifted from focusing on monetary targets (M3) to an\ninﬂation target of less than 2% inﬂation per year. This measure is taken based on the\nnational consumer price index. Monetary targets still remain important indicators\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)233and are closely watched by the central bank, because they provide information on\nthe long-term inﬂation. This new inﬂation focus also increases the central bank’s\ntransparency. In their mandate, they have clearly stated, ‘‘Should inﬂation exceed\n2% in the medium term, the National Bank will tend to tighten its monetary stance.’’\nIf there is danger of deﬂation, the National Bank would loosen monetary policy. The\nSNB also closely monitors exchange rates, as excessive strength in the Swiss franc\ncan cause inﬂationary conditions. This is especially true in environments of global\nrisk aversion, as capital ﬂows into Switzerland increases signiﬁcantly during those\ntimes. As a result, the SNB typically favors a weak franc, and is not hesitant to use\nintervention as liquidity tool. SNB ofﬁcials intervene in the franc using a variety of\nmethods including verbal remarks on liquidity, money supply, and the currency.\nTheir Tools\nThe most commonly used tools by the SNB to implement monetary policy include\nthe following.\nTarget Interest Rate Range\nTraditionally, the SNB implements monetary policy by setting a target range for\ntheir three-month interest rate known as the Swiss Franc Libor rate. According\nto the SNB, ‘‘The Libor is a reference inte rest rate in the interbank market for\nunsecured loans.’’ It is a trimmed mean of the rates charged by 12 leading banks and\nis published daily by the British Bankers’ Association. The National Bank publishes\nits target range regularly. As a rule, this range extends over 1 percentage point,\nand the SNB generally aims to keep the Libor in the middle of the range. The SNB\nundertakes quarterly economic and monetary assessments at which it reviews its\nmonetary policy. If circumstances so require, it will also adjust the Libor target\nrange in between these quarterly assessments. It sets out the reasons for its decisions\nin press releases.\nOpen Market Operations\nRepo transactions are the SNB’s major monetary policy instrument. A repo\ntransaction involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider\n(lender), while agreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity\nat a later date. This structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker\nmust pay the cash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short\nmaturities ranging from one day to a few weeks. The SNB uses these repo transactions\nto manipulate undesirable moves in the three-month Libor rate. To prevent increases\nin the three-month Libor rate above the SNB’s target, the bank would supply the\ncommercial banks with additional liquidity through repo transactions at lower repo\nrates, and in essence create additional liquidity. Conversely, the SNB can reduce\nliquidity or induce increases in the three-month Libor rate by increasing repo rates.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)234In addition to the quarterly monetary policy decision, the SNB publishes a\nQuarterly Bulletin with a detailed assessment of the current state of the economy\nand a review of monetary policy. A Monthly Bulletin is also published containing a\nshort review of economic developments. These reports are important to watch, as\nthey may contain information on changes in the SNB’s assessment of economy and\nguidance on monetary policy.\n1.20 EUR/CHF Peg Implementation and Abandonment\nFew would have expected that one of the seminal developments in the forex market\nwas the Swiss National Bank’s decision to implement and later abandon its 1.20\nEURCHF peg. This decision transformed the foreign exchange industry, bankrupted\nmany brokers, and led to tighter regulations across the globe. Faced with a high level\nof uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued currency and deﬂation risks\nin 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At\nthe time, it pledged to sell francs in an unlimited quantity to maintain the peg. The\ngoal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping the gain in the franc. However,\nin January 2015, the prospect of quantitative easing from the European Central\nBank pushed the SNB to abandon the peg. It also accumulated signiﬁcant foreign\nexchange reserves that irritated critics, but more importantly, the franc became less\novervalued through the years, giving the SNB fewer reasons to maintain the peg.\nSNB’s decision was a complete surprise, and caused a 30% drop in EURCHF in\na single day. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\n■Important Characteristics of the Swiss Franc\n■Safe haven status . This is perhaps the most unique characteristic of the Swiss franc.\nSwitzerland’s safe haven status is continually stressed because this and the secrecy\nof the banking system are the key advantages of Switzerland. The Swiss franc\nmoves primarily on external events rather than domestic economic conditions.\nThat is, as mentioned earlier, due to its political neutrality, the franc is considered\nthe world’s premier safe haven currency. Therefore, in times of global instability\nand/or uncertainty, investors tend to be more concerned with capital retention\nthan appreciation. At such times, funds will ﬂow into Switzerland, which would\ncause the Swiss franc to appreciate regardless of whether growth conditions are\nfavorable.\n■Swiss franc is closely correlated with gold . Switzerland is the world’s third largest\nofﬁcial holder of gold. In the past, a Swiss constitutional mandate required the\ncurrency to be backed 40% with gold reserves. The mandate is now removed\nbut the positive correlation between the Swiss franc and gold remains because\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)235the relationship has been engrained into the minds of forex traders; therefore,\nboth gold and the Swiss franc are perceived as safe haven instruments. Before the\nSNB abandoned the EURCHF 1.20, Swiss franc had an 80% positive correlation\nwith gold. These days, the correlation is still there but in a smaller magnitude.\nGenerally speaking, if the price of gold appreciates, the Swiss franc has a high\nlikelihood of rising in value. In addition, since gold is also viewed as the ultimate\nsafe haven form of money, both gold and the Swiss franc beneﬁt during periods\nof global economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n■Carry trades effects . With one of the lowest interest rates in the industrialized world,\nover the past few years, the Swiss franc has become one of the most popular\nfunding currencies for carry trades. As mentioned in this book, the popularity of\ncarry trades has increased signiﬁcantly over the past two decades, as investors are\nactively seeking high yield. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency\nwith a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest\nrate. With CHF having one of the lowest interest rates of all industrialized\ncountries, it is one of the primary currencies sold or borrowed in carry trades.\nThis results in the need to sell CHF against a higher yielding currency. Carry\ntrades are typically done in cross-currencies such as GBPCHF or AUDCHF, but\nthese trades can impact both EURCHF and USDCHF. The unwinding of carry\ntrades involves the need for investors to buy back the Swiss franc.\n■Interest rate differentials between euro Swiss futures and foreign interest rate futures are\nclosely followed . One of the favorite indicators of professional Swiss franc traders\nis the interest rate differential bet ween three-month euro Swiss futures and\neurodollar futures. These differentials can provide guidance on potential money\nﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield U.S. ﬁxed-income assets are\noffering over Swiss ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides\ntraders with indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always\nlooking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry\ntraders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate\ndifferentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Potential changes in banking regulations . Over the past few years members of the\nEuropean Union have been exerting signiﬁcant pressure on Switzerland to relax\nthe conﬁdentiality of their banking system and to increase transparency of their\ncustomers’ accounts. The European Union is pressing this issue because of its\nactive measures to persecute EU tax evaders. This should be a concern for many\nyears to come. However, this is a difﬁcult decision for Switzerland to make because\nthe conﬁdentiality of their customers’ accounts represents the core strength of\ntheir banking system. The EU has threatened to impose severe sanctions on\nSwitzerland if they do not comply with their proposed measures. Both countries\nare currently working to negotiate an equitable resolution. Any news or talk of\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)236changing banking regulations will impact both Switzerland’s economy and the\nSwiss franc.\n■Mergers and acquisition activity . Switzerland’s primary industry is banking and\nﬁnance. In this industry, merger and acquisition activities (M&A) are very\ncommon, especially as consolidation continues in the overall industry. As a result,\nthese M&A activities can have signiﬁcant impact on the Swiss franc. If foreign\nﬁrms purchase Swiss banks or insurance companies, they will need to buy Swiss\nfrancs and in turn, sell their local currency. If Swiss banks purchase foreign ﬁrms,\nthey would need to sell Swiss francs and buy the foreign currency. Either way,\nit is important for Swiss franc traders to frequently watch for notices on M&A\nactivity involving Swiss ﬁrms.\n■Trading behavior, cross currency characteristics . The EURCHF is the most commonly\ntraded currency for traders who want to participate in CHF movements. USDCHF\nis less frequently traded because of its greater illiquidity and volatility. However,\nday traders may tend to favor USDCHF over EURCHF because of its volatile\nmovements. In actuality, the USDCHF is a synthetic currency derived from\nEURUSD and EURCHF because more tra nsactions are done between the euro\nand Swiss franc. Market makers or professional traders tend to use those pairs as\nleading indicators for trading USDCHF or to price the current USDCHF level\nwhen the currency pair is illiquid. Theoretically, the USDCHF rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURCHF rate divided by EURUSD. Only during times of\nunusual circumstances, such as the Iraq War, September 11, or the EURCHF peg,\nwill USDCHF develop a market of its own. Any small differences in these rates\nare quickly exploited by market participants. Figure 29.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of EUR-CHF.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Switzerland\nEconomic data from Switzerland tends to have limited impact on the currency, but\nthese are the most important pieces of Swiss data.\nKoF Leading Indicators\nThe KoF leading indicators report is released by the Swiss Institute for Business\nCycle Research. This index is generally used to gauge the future health of the\nSwiss economy. It contains six components: (1) change in manufacturers’ orders;\n(2) the expected purchase plans of manufacturers over the next three months; (3)\nthe judgment of stocks in wholesale business; (4) consumer perception of their\nﬁnancial conditions; (5) backlog in the construction sector; and (6) orders backlog\nfor manufacturers.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)\nk\nk237\nk\nk\nFIGURE 29.1 EURCHF 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)238Consumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index is calculated monthly, on the basis of retail prices paid in\nSwitzerland. In accordance with prevalent international practice, the commodities\ncovered are distinguished according to the consumption concept, which includes in\nthe calculation of the CPI of those goods and services that are part of the private\nconsumption aggregate according to the National Accounts. The basket of goods does\nnot include transfer expenditure such as direct taxation, social insurance contributions,\nand health insurance premiums. The index is a key measure of inﬂation.\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services in\nthe Switzerland. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Switzerland ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nBalance of Payments\nBalance of payments is the collective term for the accounts of Swiss transactions\nwith the rest of the world. The current account is the balance of trade plus services\nportion. BoP is an important indicator for Swiss traders, as Switzerland has always\nkept a strong current account balance. Any changes to the current account, positive\nor negative, could see substantial ﬂows.\nProduction Index (Industrial Production)\nThe production index is a quarterly measure of the change in the volume of industrial\nproduction (or physical output by producers).\nRetail Sales\nSwitzerland’s retail sales report is released on a monthly basis 40 days after the\nreference month. The report is an important indicator of consumer spending habits\nand is not seasonally adjusted.\n239CHAPTER 30\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nJapanese Yen (JPY)\n■Economic Overview\nJapan is the third largest economy in the world with GDP valued at over US$4.6\ntrillion in 2014 (behind the United States and China). If we count the European\nUnion as a whole, it would be considered the fourth largest economy. Japan is one of\nthe world’s largest exporters and is responsible for over US$690 billion in exports\nper year. Manufacturing and exports of products such as electronics and cars are the\nsignature drivers of the economy, accounting for nearly 17% of GDP. As a result,\nJapanese growth is extremely sensitive to the value of the currency. For many years,\nJapan has maintained a trade surplus, but the earthquake followed by tsunami in\n2011 turned the country into a net oil importer and created a long period of trade\nimbalances, where oil imports exceeded exports in value. This began to change in\nearly 2015, when a weakening yen and falling oil prices helped to turn around trade\nactivity, returning Japan to a surplus nation. Having a trade surplus means that there\nwill be inherent demand for the Japanese yen even when interest rates are low\nand there are structural deﬁciencies. Japan’s most important trade partners are the\nUnited States and China:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. South Korea\n4. Taiwan\n5. Hong Kong\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)240Leading Import Sources:\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. South Korea\n4. Australia\n5. Saudi Arabia\n■Abenomics\nIn the 1980s, Japan’s capital market was one of the most attractive markets for\ninternational investors seeking investment opportunities in Asia. Japan had the most\ndeveloped capital markets in the region, and its banking system was considered to\nbe the one of the strongest in the world. At the time, the country was experiencing\nabove-trend economic growth and near zero inﬂation. This resulted in rapid\ngrowth expectations, boosted asset prices, and rapid credit expansion, leading to the\ndevelopment of an a sset bubble. Between 1990 and 1997, the asset bubble collapsed,\ninducing a US$10 trillion decline in asset prices, with the fall in real estate values\naccounting for nearly 65% of the total decline, nearly two years of national output.\nThis fall in asset prices sparked the banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early\n1990s and developed into a full-blown systemic crisis in 1997 following the failure\nof a number of high-proﬁle ﬁnancial institutions. Many of these banks and ﬁnancial\ninstitutions extended loans to builders and real estate developers at the height of\nthe asset bubble in the 1980s, with land as collateral. A number of these developers\ndefaulted after the asset bubble collapse, leaving the country’s banks saddled with\nbad debt and collateral worth sometimes 60% to 80% less than when the loans\nwere taken out. Due to the large size of these banking institutions and their role in\ncorporate funding, the crisis had profound effects on Japan and the global economy.\nEnormous bad debts, falling stock prices, and a collapsing real estate sector crippled\nJapan’s economy for more than two decades.\nIt was not until the rollout of Abenomics that the economy began to turn around.\nWhen Shinzo Abe became prime minister for the second time in 2012, he rolled out\na three-pronged plan to stimulate growth and pull the economy out of stagnation\nthrough monetary policy, ﬁscal policy, and economic growth strategies. This was\nknown as Abenomics . In the ﬁrst few weeks of the pr ogram, Abe announced a massive\nstimulus package that involved signiﬁcant government spending and a strong dose\nof quantitative easing. The effects were almost immediate, with the Japanese yen\nfalling signiﬁcantly across the board. Not soon after, the unemployment rate started\nto fall and growth slowly returned.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)241■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers\nMonetary policy in Japan is determined by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). In 1998, the\nJapanese government passed laws giving the BoJ operational independence from the\nMinistry of Finance (MoF) and complete control over monetary policy. However,\ndespite the government’s attempts to decen tralize decision making, the MoF still\nremains in charge of foreign exchange policy. The BoJ is responsible for executing\nall ofﬁcial Japanese foreign exchange transactions at the direction of the MoF. The\nBank of Japan’s Policy Board consists of the BoJ governor, two deputy governors,\nand six other members. Monetary policy meetings are held twice a month, with\nbrieﬁngs and press releases provided immediately. The BoJ also publishes a Monthly\nReport issued by the Policy Board, and a Monthly Economic Report . These reports\nare important to watch for changes in BoJ sentiment and signals of new monetary\nor ﬁscal policy measures, as the government is constantly trying to develop fresh\ninitiatives to stimulate growth.\nThe MoF and the BoJ are very important institutions, and they both can\ninﬂuence currency movements. Since the MoF is the director of foreign exchange\ninterventions, it is important to watch and keep abreast of the comments made\nfrom MoF ofﬁcials. Being an export driven economy, the government tends to favor\na weaker currency. So if the Japanese yen appreciates signiﬁcantly or too rapidly\nagainst the dollar, members of the BoJ and MoF will become increasingly vocal about\ntheir concerns or disapproval in regards to its current level or recent movements.\nThese comments can affect how the yen moves, but if government ofﬁcials ﬂood the\nmarket with comments and there is no follow-up action, the market would start\nto become immune to these concerns. However, the MoF and BoJ have a lengthy\nhistory of interventions in the currency markets to manipulate the value of the yen\nvalue in Japan’s best interests, so their comments cannot be completely ignored.\nThe most popular tool that the BoJ uses to control monetary policy is open\nmarket operations.\nOpen Market Operations\nThese activities are focused on controlling th e uncollateralized overnight call rate.\nThe Bank of Japan has maintained a zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) for some time\nnow, which means that the Bank of Japan cannot lower this rate further to stimulate\ngrowth, consumption, or liquidity. Therefore, in order to maintain zero interest\nrates, the BoJ has to manipulate liquidity through open market operations, targeting\nzero interest on the overnight call rate. It manipulates liquidity by the outright\nbuying or selling of bills, repos, or Japanese government bonds. A repo transaction\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)242involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider (lender), while\nagreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date.\nThis structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the\ncash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities,\nranging from one day to a few weeks.\nImportant Characteristics of the JPY\n■Proxy for Asian strength/weakness . Japan tends to be seen as a proxy for broad Asian\nstrength because the country has the largest GDP in Asia outside of China. With\nthe most developed capital markets, Japan was once the primary destination for\nall investors who wanted access into the region. Japan also conducts a signiﬁcant\namount of trade with its Asian partners. As a result, economic problems or\npolitical instability in Japan tend to spill over into the other Asian countries.\nHowever, this spillover is not one-sided. Economic or political problems in\nother Asian economies, particularly China, can also have dramatic impacts on\nthe Japanese economy and in turn movements in the Japanese yen. For example,\nNorth Korean political instability poses a great risk to Japan and the Japanese yen\ndue to the country’s geographic proximity.\n■Bank of Japan intervention practices . The BoJ and MoF are active participants in\nthe foreign exchange markets. That is, t hey have a lengthy history of entering\nthe FX markets if they are d issatisﬁed with the value of the Japanese yen. While\nthey have not intervened since 2011, they won’t be reluctant to do so if the\ncurrency strengthens signiﬁcantly. As Japan is a very political economy, with\nclose ties between government ofﬁcials and principals of large private institutions,\nthe MoF can have a very narrow segment in mind when it decides to intervene\nin the currency. Since the BoJ is such an active participant, it is very in tune\nwith the market movements and its participants. Periodically, the BoJ receives\ninformation on large hedge fund positions from banks and likes to intervene when\nspeculators are on the other side of the market, allowing them to get the most\n‘‘bang for the bucks.’’ The MoF and BoJ always considers three main factors\nbefore intervention:\n1.Amount of appreciation/depreciation in JPY —Intervention has historically\noccurred when the yen moves by 7 or more yen in less than 6 weeks. Using\nthe USDJPY as a barometer, 7 yen would be equivalent to 700 pips, which\nwould represent a move from 120.00 to 127.00.\n2.Current USDJPY rate —Historically, only 11% of all BoJ interventions that\nwere conducted to counter a strong JPY occurred above the 115 level.\n3.Speculative positions— In order to maximize the impact of intervention, the\nBoJ and MoF prefer to intervene when market participants hold massive\npositions in the opposing direction because the ﬂow of stops will exacerbate\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)243the reversal in the currency pair. The CFTC provides a weekly report on\nexisting speculative positions that can be found at www.cftc.gov.\n■JPY movements are sensitive to time . The Japanese yen can be particularly active\ntowards the end of Japan’s ﬁscal year (March 31), as exporters repatriate their\ndollar denominated assets to window dress their balance sheets. This is particularly\nimportant for Japanese banks because they need to rebuild their balance sheets\nto meet FSA guidelines that require the banks to mark to market their security\nholdings. In anticipation of the need for repatriation-related purchases, Japanese\nyen speculators frequently bid the yen higher in attempt to take advantage of this\nincreased inﬂow. As a result, following ﬁscal year end, the Japanese yen tends to\nhave a bias toward depreciation as speculators close their positions.\nAside from the ﬁscal year end, time is also a factor on a day-to-day basis.\nUnlike traders in London or New York who typically have lunch at their trading\ndesk, Japanese traders tend to take hour-long lunches, leaving only a junior trader\nin the ofﬁce. On occasion, this can translate into additional volatility in the yen\nduring this period as the market becomes illiquid. In addition to this period, the\nJPY tends to move fairly orderly during Japanese and London hours, unless there\nare ofﬁcial comments or major surprises in economic data. During U.S. hours,\nhowever, the JPY tends to have higher volatility, as U.S. traders are actively\nengaging in dollar and yen positions.\n■Stocks and bonds have a positive correlation with USDJPY . The Nikkei has a positive\ncorrelation with USDJPY, which means that when the currency pair appreciating,\nequities are generally on the rise as well. For Japan, the currency typically leads\nequities because a weak yen is positive for the economy, but there can be times\nwhen equities lead currencies. The spread between U.S. 10-year Treasury and\nJGB yields is also very important for the currency. Typically, when the yield\nspread is on the rise, we see USDJPY move higher, and when the yield spread\ndeclines, it creates pressure on USDJPY. Figure 30.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of USDJPY.\n■Carry trade effects . The popularity of carry trades has increased in recent years, as\ninvestors are actively seeking high-yielding assets. With the Japanese yen having\nthe lowest interest rate of all industrialized countries, it is the primary currency\nsold or borrowed in carry trades. The most popular carry trade currencies\nincluded GBPJPY, AUDJPY, NZDJPY, and even USDJPY. Carry traders would\ngo short the Japanese yen against the higher yielding currencies. Unwinding of\ncarry trades as result of spread narrowing is typically beneﬁcial for the Japanese\nyen, as the reversal process involves purchasing the yen and buying back other\ncurrencies. Since there is so much demand to sell the yen for carry, in periods of\nrisk aversion, these trades can be unwound quickly creating a signiﬁcant rally in\nthe currency.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)244■Important Economic Indicators for Japan\nSince Japan is a manufacturing-oriented economy, manufacturing data tend to have\nthe most signiﬁcant impact on the yen. However, on a monthly basis, unless there is\na big surprise, Japanese data do not typically move the currency. The most inﬂuential\nevent risk is always the monetary policy announcement and trade balance. Aside\nfrom that, these are the numbers to watch.\nTankan Survey\nIf there is one piece of Japanese data to follow, it should be the quarterly Tankan\nReport. The Tankan is an economic survey of Japanese enterprises published four\ntimes a year. The survey includes more than 9,000 enterprises, which are divided\ninto four major groups: large, small, and medium-sized companies, as well as\nprincipal enterprises. The survey provides us with an overall impression of the\nbusiness climate in Japan and is widely watched and anticipated by foreign exchange\nmarket participants.\nBalance of Payments\nThe monthly balance of payments report provides investors with insight into Japan’s\ninternational economic transactions that include goods, services, investment income,\nand capital ﬂows. The current account side of BoJ can be used a good gauge of\ninternational trade. Figures are released on a monthly and semiannual basis.\nEmployment\nEmployment ﬁgures are reported on a monthly basis by the Management and\nCoordination Agency of Japan. The employment release measures the number of\njobs and unemployment rate for the country as a whole. The data are obtained\nthrough a statistical survey of the current labor force. This release is a closely\nwatched economic indicator because of its timeliness and its importance as a leading\nindicator of economic activity.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures trends in the output of Japanese\nmanufacturing, mining, and utilities companies. Output refers to the total quantity\nof items produced. The index covers the production of goods for domestic sales\nin Japan and for export. It excludes production in the agriculture, construction,\ntransportation, communication, trade, ﬁnance, and service industries; government\noutput; and imports. The IP index is then developed by weighting each component\naccording to its relative importance during this base period. Investors feel IP and\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)\nk\nk245\nk\nk\nFIGURE 30.1 USDJPY 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)246inventory accumulation have strong correlations with total output and can provide\nvaluable insight into the current state of the economy.\nGDP\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a broad measure of the total production and\nconsumption of goods and services measured over quarterly and yearly periods in\nJapan. GDP is measured by adding total expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. Preliminary reports\nare the most signiﬁcant for FX market participants.\n247CHAPTER 31\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nAustralian Dollar\n(AUD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nAustralia is the twelfth largest country in the world, with a gross domestic product\nof approximately US$1.5 trillion. In Asia, it ranks as the third largest economy\nin the region. On a relative basis, the economy is very small, only one-tenth\nthat of the United States and less than one-ﬁfth the size of China. However on a\nper capita basis, Australia ranks right up there with many industrialized Western\nEuropean countries. Australia has a service-oriented economy with close to 70%\nof GDP coming from industries such as ﬁnance, property, and business services.\nHowever, the country has a trade deﬁcit, with manufacturing dominating the\ncountry’s exporting activities. Rural and mineral exports account for over 60% of all\nmanufacturing exports and 12% of GDP. The economy is therefore highly sensitive\nto changes in commodity prices. As a country heavily dependent on exports, the\npace of growth of Australia’s largest trade partners is extremely important because\ndownturns or rapid growth abroad can impact import and export demand. Here’s a\nbreakdown of Australia’s most important trading partners:\nL a r g e s tE x p o r tM a r k e t s\n1. China\n2. Japan\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)2483. South Korea\n4. United States\n5. New Zealand\nLargest Import Sources\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. Japan\n4. Singapore\n5. Germany\nAs you can see, Australia’s number one trading partner is China. In fact, Chinese\ndemand represents a third of the country’s trade activity. In terms of products, the\nChinese are major importers of Australian iron ore, coal, natural gas, and gold.\nAsia Pac is extremely important to Australia, as more than 70% of its exports are\ndestined for countries within the region. This makes Australia’s economy highly\nsensitive to the performance of countries in the Asian Paciﬁc region. Hiccups in\nChina’s economy can have a signiﬁcant impact on Australia, not only in terms of\nexporting activities but also on housing market activity. At the same time, growth in\nChina is positive for Australia’s economy. During the global ﬁnancial crisis, exports\nto China helped shelter Australia from a major downturn. The relationship between\nChina and Australia is known as Sino-Australian relations. China has recently taken\nsteps to produce its own resources, and if this trend continues, it could dramatically\nchange the landscape of Australia’s economy.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is the central bank of Australia. The monetary\npolicy committee within the central bank consists of the governor (chairman), the\ndeputy governor (vice chairman), secretary to the treasurer, and six independent\nmembers appointed by the government. Changes to monetary policy are made on\nconsensus within the committee.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nThe RBA’s charter states t hat the mandate of the Reserve Bank Board is to focus\nmonetary and banking policy on ensuring:\n1. The stability of the currency of Australia;\n2. The maintenance of full employment in Australia; and\n3. The economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)249In order to achieve these objectives, the government has set an informal consumer\nprice inﬂation target of 2% to 3% per year. The RBA believes that the key to long-\nterm sustainable growth in the economy is to control inﬂation, which would preserve\nthe value of money. In addition, an inﬂation target provides a discipline for monetary\npolicy making and guidelines for private-sector inﬂation expectations. This also\nincreases the transparency of the banks’ activities. Should inﬂation or inﬂation\nexpectations exceed the 2% to 3% target, traders should know that it would raise\nred ﬂags at the RBA and prompt the central bank to favor a tighter monetary policy\nor, in the other words, further rate hikes.\nMonetary policy decisions involve setting the interest rate on overnight loans\nin the money market. Other interest rates in the economy are inﬂuenced by this\ninterest rate to varying degrees, so that the behavior of borrowers and lenders in\nthe ﬁnancial markets is affected by monetary policy (though not only by monetary\npolicy). Through these channels, monetary policy affects the economy in pursuit of\nthe goals just outlined.\nCash Rate\nThe cash rate is the RBA’s target rate for open market operations and is the rate\ncharged on overnight loans between ﬁnancial intermediaries. This means the cash\nrate should have a close relationship with the prevailing money market interest rates.\nChanges in monetary policy directly affect the interest rate structure of the ﬁnancial\nsystem. They also affect sentiment in a currency. Figure 31.1 graphs the AUDUSD\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.01. 2\n1. 1\n1. 0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n6/4/10 6/4/11 6/4/12AUDUSD vs. AU-US 10 Year Spread\n6/4/13 6/4/14 6/4/15\nAU-US Spread AUDUSD\nFIGURE 31.1 AUDUSD vs. 10-Year Yield Spread\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)250against the interest rate differential between Australia and the United States between\n2010 and 2015. There is clearly a positive c orrelation between the 10-year yield\nspread and the currency. Between June 2014 and June 2015, for example, the yield\nspread dropped from 1.5% to 0.5%, and thi s coincided with a drop in the AUDUSD\nfrom 95 to 76 cents.\nMaintaining the Cash Rate: Open Market Operations\nThe focus of daily open market operations is to keep the cash rate close to the target,\nby managing money market liquidity provided to commercial banks. If the Reserve\nBank wishes to decrease the cash rate, it would increase supply of short-dated\nrepurchase agreements at a lower interest rate than the prevailing cash rate, which\nwould in essence decrease the cash rate. If the Reserve Bank wishes to increase\nthe cash rate, it would decrease supply of short-dated repurchase agreements,\nwhich would increase the cash rate. A repurchase agreement involves a cash taker\n(commercial bank) selling securities to a cash provider (RBA), while agreeing to\nrepurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date. This structure\nis similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the cash provider\ninterest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities, ranging from\none day to a few weeks.\nAustralia has had a ﬂoating exchange rate since 1983, and the Reserve Bank\nof Australia may undertake foreign exchange market operations when the market\nthreatens to become excessively volatile or when the exchange rate is clearly\ninconsistent with underlying economic fundamentals. The RBA monitors a trade-\nweighted index (TWI), as well as the cross-rate with the U.S. dollar. Intervention\noperations are invariably aimed at stabilizing market conditions rather than meeting\nexchange rate targets.\nMonetary Policy Meetings\nThe RBA meets every month (except for January), on the ﬁrst Tuesday of each\nmonth, to discuss potential changes in monetary policy. Following each meeting, the\nRBA issues a press release outlining justiﬁcations for its monetary policy changes.\nIf it leaves rates unchanged, no statement is published. The RBA also publishes a\nmonthly Reserve Bank Bulletin . The May and November issues of the Reserve Bank\nBulletin include the semiannual statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy. The\nFebruary, May, August, and November issues contain a Quarterly Report on the\nEconomy and Financial Markets. It is important to read these bulletins for signals on\npotential monetary policy changes.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)251Important Characteristics of the Australian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . Historically, the Australian dollar has had a very strongly\ncorrelation (approximately 80%) with commodity prices and, more speciﬁcally,\ngold and iron ore prices. The correlation stems from the fact that Australia is\nthe world’s second largest gold producer and the world’s largest producer of\niron ore. Therefore, the price of iron ore and gold is extremely important to\nAustralia’s economy. However, unless there is a sharp movement in gold or\niron ore prices, it generally takes time for the AUDUSD to adjust to changes in\nthe price of commodities. Generally speaking, if commodity prices are strong,\ninﬂationary fears start to appear, and the RBA would be inclined to raise rates to\ncurb inﬂation. However, this is a sensitive topic, as gold prices tend to increase\nin times of global economic or political uncertainty. If the RBA increases rates\nduring those conditions, it leaves Australia more vulnerable to spillover effects.\n■Carry trade effects . Australia has one of highest interest rates among the developed\ncountries. With a fairly liquid currency, the Australian dollar is one of the most\npopular currencies to use for carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or\nlending a currency with a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency\nwith a low interest rate. The popularity of the carry trade has contributed to the\n57% rise of the Australian dollar aga inst the U.S. dolla r between 2001 and 2005.\nWhile the carry trade suffered great ly in 2008, it came back strongly between\n2009 and 2011. During this time, many foreign investors were looking for high\nyield when equity investments offered minimal returns. However, carry trades\nonly last as long as the actual yield advantage remains. If global central banks\nincrease their interest rates and the positive interest rate differential between\nAustralia and other countries narro w, the AUDUSD could s uffer from an exodus\nof carry traders.\n■Drought effects . Since the majority of Australia’s exports are commodities, the\ncountry’s GDP is highly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage\nthe country’s farming activities. For example, 2002 was a particularly difﬁcult\nyear for Australia, because the country was experiencing a severe drought. The\ndrought took an extreme toll on Australia’s farming activities, with dry conditions\nhampering the economy throughout the twenty-ﬁrst century. This is important\nbecause agriculture accounts for 3% of the country’s GDP. The RBA estimates\nthat the ‘‘decline in farm production could directly reduce GDP growth by\naround 1 percentage point.’’ Aside from exporting activities, a drought also has\nindirect effects on other aspects of Australia’s economy. Industries that supply and\nservice agriculture, such as the wholesale and transport sectors, as well as retail\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)252operations in rural farming areas, may also be negatively affected by a drought.\nHowever, it is also important to note that the Australian economy has a history\nof recovering strongly after a drought. The 1982–1983 drought ﬁrst subtracted\nthen subsequently added around 1% to 1 1∕2% to GDP growth. The 1991–1995\ndrought reduced GDP by around 1∕2to3∕4percentage points in 1991–1992 and\n1994–1995, but the recovery boosted GDP by 3∕4percentage points.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of Australia\nand the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries should\nalso be closely watched by Australian dollar traders. These differentials can be\ngood indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much premium\nyield Australian dollar short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Australia\nGDP\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services\nin Australia. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Australia ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth generally coincides with a\nweak growth period.\nCPI\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a basket\nof goods and services, which account for a high proportion of expenditure by the\nCPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation, and\nhealth. This is an important indicator to watch, as it is a key input for monetary\npolicy decisions.\nBalance of Goods and Services\nThis number is a monthly measure of Australia’s international trade in goods and\nservices on a balance of payments basis. General merchandise imports and exports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)\nk\nk253\nk\nk\nFIGURE 31.2 AUDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)254are derived mainly from international trade statistics, which are based on Australian\nCustoms Service records. The current account is the balance of trade plus services.\nPrivate Consumption\nThis is a national accounts measure that reﬂects current expenditure by households\nand producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes purchases of\ndurable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure by persons\non the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by unincorporated\nenterprises. This number is important to watch, as private consumption or consumer\nconsumption is the foundation for resilience in the Australian economy.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average\nchanges in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI\ntracks changes in prices for nearly every goods-producing industry in the domestic\neconomy, including agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries,\nmanufacturing, and mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally\nadjusted ﬁnished goods PPI and how the index has reacted on an m/m, q/q, h/h\nand y/y basis. Australia’s PPI data are released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 31.2 illustrates the 10 year performance of AUDUSD.\n255CHAPTER 32\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nNew Zealand Dollar\n(NZD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nNew Zealand is a very small economy with GDP valued at approximately\nUS$183 billion in 2013. In fact, there are less people living in New Zealand\nthan in New York City. It was once one of the most regulated countries within\nthe OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), but over\nthe past two decades the country has been moving toward a more open, modern,\nand stable economy. With the passing of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994, the\ncountry is shifting from an agricultural farming community to one that seeks to\nbecome a leading knowledge-based economy with high skills, high employment,\nand high value-added production. This act sets legal standards that hold the govern-\nment formally responsible to the public for its ﬁscal performance. It also sets the\nframework for the country’s macroeconomic policies. The following are the ﬁve\nprinciples outlined under the Fiscal Responsibility Act:\n1. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; by achieving surpluses on the\noperating budget every year until such a level is reached.\n2. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; and the government must ensure\nthat expenditure is lower than revenue.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)2563. Sufﬁcient levels of Crown net worth must be achieved and maintained to guard\nagainst adverse future events.\n4. Reasonable taxation policies must be followed.\n5. Fiscal risks facing the government must be prudently managed.\nNew Zealand also has highly developed manufacturing and services sectors,\nwith the agricultural industry driving the bulk of the country’s exports. The\neconomy is strongly trade-oriented, with exports of goods and services representing\napproximately one third of GDP. Due to the small size of the economy and its\nsigniﬁcant trade activities, New Zealand is highly sensitive to global performance,\nespecially of its key Asian trading partners, Australia, China, United States, and Japan.\nTogether, Australia, China, and Japan represent 42% of New Zealand’s trading\nactivity. It is also extremely sensitive to exchange rate ﬂuctuations, particularly\nagainst the Australian dollar. The fo llowing lists are a breakdown of the New\nZealand’s most important trading partners:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Australia\n2. China\n3. European Union\n4. United States\n5. Japan\nLeading Import Sources\n1. European Union\n2. China\n3. Australia\n4. United States\n5. Japan\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Reserve\nBank of New Zealand\nMonetary policy in New Zealand is determined by the Reserve Bank (RBNZ).\nThe Monetary Policy Committee is an internal committee of bank executives who\nreview monetary policy on a weekly basis. Meetings to decide on changes to\nmonetary policy occur eight ti mes a year, or approximate ly every six weeks. Unlike\nmost other central banks, the decision for rate changes rests ultimately on the bank’s\ngovernor. The current policy target agreements set by the minister and the governor\nfocus on maintaining policy stability and avoiding unnecessary instability in output,\ninterest rates, and the exchange rate. Price stability refers to maintaining the annual\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)257CPI inﬂation at 1.5%. If the RBNZ does not meet this target, the government has\nthe ability to dismiss the governor of the RBNZ. This is rarely done, but this serves\nas a strong incentive for the RBNZ to meets its inﬂation target. The most common\ntools used by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy changes are the following.\nOfﬁcial Cash Rate (OCR)\nThe Ofﬁcial Cash Rate is the rate set by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy.\nThe Bank lends overnight cash at 25 basis points above the OCR rate and receives\ndeposits or pays interest at 25 basis points below this rate. By controlling the cost\nof liquidity for commercial banks, the RBNZ can inﬂuence the interest rates offered\nto individuals and corporations. This effectively creates a 50 basis point corridor\nthat bounds the interbank overnight rate. The idea is then that banks offering funds\nabove the upper bound will attract few takers, because funds can be borrowed for\na lower cost from the RBNZ. Also, banks offering rates below the lower bound\nwill also attract few takers, because they are offering lower yields than the RBNZ.\nThe ofﬁcial cash rate is reviewed and manipulated with the goal of maintaining\neconomic stability.\nObjectives for Fiscal Policy\nOpen market operations on the other hand are used to meet the cash target. The\ncash target is the targeted amount of reserves held by registered banks. The RBNZ\nprepares forecasts of daily ﬂuctuations on the cash target and will then use these\nforecasts to determine the amount of funds to inject or withdraw in order to meet\nthe cash target. The following government objectives provide a guideline for ﬁscal\nand monetary policy measures:\n■Expenses : Expenses will average around 35% of GDP over the horizon used to\ncalculate contributions toward future New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) costs.\nDuring the buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs, expenses plus contributions\nwill be around 35% of GDP. In the longer term, expenses less withdrawals to\nmeet NZS costs will be around 35% of GDP.\n■Revenue : Raise sufﬁcient revenue to meet the operating balance objective. A\nrobust, broad-based tax system that raises revenue in a fair and efﬁcient way.\n■Operating balance : Operating surplus on average over the economic cycle sufﬁcient\nto meet the requirements for contributions toward future NZS costs and ensure\nconsistency with the debt objective.\n■Debt: Gross debt below 30% of GDP on average over the economic cycle. Net\ndebt, which excludes the assets to meet future NZS costs, below 20% of GDP on\naverage over the economic cycle.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)258■Net worth : Increase net worth consistent with the operating balance objective.\nThis will be achieved through a buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs.\nSource: New Zealand Treasury\n■Important Characteristics of the New Zealand\nDollar\nStrong Correlation with AUD—Competition with Australia\nAustralia is New Zealand’s largest trading partner. This coupled with their geographic\nproximity and New Zealand’s high dependence on trade, creates strong ties between\nthe economies of the two countries. When the Australian economy is healthy and\nAustralian corporations increase their importing activities, New Zealand will be one\nof the ﬁrst to beneﬁt. When it is weak, New Zealand suffers but in recent years\nits sensitivity has diminished because of the country’s growing trade with China\nand other nations. Nonetheless, 22% of trade is still conducted with Australia,\nand this explains why there is a positive correlation between the two currencies.\nFigure 32.1 shows how closely AUDUS D and NZDUSD have moved between 2005\nand 2015.\nCommodity-Linked Currency\nNew Zealand is an export driven economy with commodities representing over\n40% of the country’s exports, and as a result the New Zealand dollar has a strong\ncorrelation with commodity prices, particularly dairy. Fonterra is one of the world’s\n1. 2\n1. 1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.4AUDUSD vs. NZDUSD\n6/30/05 6/30/06 6/30/07 6/30/08 6/30/09 6/30/10 6/30/11 6/30/12 6/30/13 6/30/140.5\nAUDUSD NZDUSD\nFIGURE 32.1 AUDUSD versus NZDUSD\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)259leading dairy producer and also largest company in New Zealand. Twice a month\nthe Global Dairy Trade will conduct an auction and if prices rise, it will be positive\nfor the New Zealand dollar. If prices fall, it will be negative for the currency\nbecause it can mean reduced payout and proﬁt for dairy producers. The correlation\nbetween Australian and New Zealand dollars also contributes to the NZD’s status as a\n‘‘commodity linked’’ currency. Therefore, the New Zealand dollar’s correlation with\ncommodity prices is not only limited to its own trade activities. Therefore, as com-\nmodity prices increase, the Australian economy beneﬁts, translating into increased\nactivity in all aspects of the country’s operations, including trade with New Zealand.\nCarry Trades\nOf the industrialized countries, New Zealand tends to maintain the highest interest\nrate as it needs to offer investors a higher yield to compensate for the risk of\ninvesting in a small economy. This yield advantage along with its secure credit rating\nhas made the New Zealand dollar one of the most popular currencies to purchase\nfor carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. The\npopularity of the carry trade has contributed to the rise of the New Zealand dollar in\nan environment where many global investors are looking for opportunities to earn\nhigh yield. However, this also makes the New Zealand dollar particularly sensitive\nto changes in interest rates. That is, when the United States begins increasing their\ninterest rates, while New Zealand stays on hold or reduces their interest rates, the\ncarry advantage of the New Zealand dollar would narrow. In such situations, the\nNew Zealand dollar could come under pressure as speculators reverse their carry\ntrade positions.\nInterest Rate Differentials\nInterest rate differentials between the cash rates of New Zealand and the short\nterm interest rate yields of other industrialized countries are closely watched by\nprofessional NZD traders. These differentials can be good indicators of potential\nmoney ﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield NZD short-term ﬁxed-\nincome assets are offering over foreign short-term ﬁxed income assets, or vice versa.\nThis differential provides traders with indications of potential currency movements,\nas investors are always looking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly\nimportant to carry traders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive\ninterest rate differentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\nPopulation Migration\nAs mentioned earlier, New Zealand has a very small population, less than half of\nNew York City. Therefore, changes in migration can have signiﬁcant effects on the\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)260economy. Between 2013 an d 2014, the population of New Zealand increased by\n78,800 people, which was the largest net migration in at least 90 years. Between\n2011 and 2012, for example, the population only grew by 26,400 people. Although\nthese absolute numbers appear small, it is fairly signiﬁcant for New Zealand because\nof the size of the population. In fact, this strong population migration into New\nZealand has contributed signiﬁcantly to the performance of the economy, because\nas the population increases, the demand for household goods increases, leading to\nan increase in overall consumer consumption.\nDrought Effects\nSince the bulk of New Zealand’s exports are commodities, the country’s GDP is\nhighly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage the country’s farming\nactivities. In 2013, droughts cost the country over $1.3 billion. In addition, droughts\nare also very frequent in Australia, New Zealand’s largest trading partner, and when\nthey occur it can have a negative impact on the New Zealand economy.\n■Important Economic Indicators for New Zealand\nNew Zealand does not release economic indicators often; however, when they do,\nthe following items are the most important:\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a quarterly measure of the total production and consumption of goods and\nservices in New Zealand. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households,\nbusinesses, government, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used\nto convert output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. This data are\nused to gauge where in the business cycle New Zealand ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often\nis perceived inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nConsumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a\n‘‘basket’’ of goods and services that account for a high proportion of expenditure by\nthe CPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation,\nand health. This is an important indicator to watch, as monetary policy changes are\nhighly inﬂuenced by this index as it is a measure of inﬂation.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)\nk\nk261\nk\nk\nFIGURE 32.2 NZDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)262Balance of Goods and Services\nNew Zealand’s Balance of Payments statements are records of the value of New\nZealand’s transactions in goods, services, income, and transfers with the rest of the\nworld, and the changes in New Zealand’s ﬁnancial claims on (assets), and liabilities\nto, the rest of the world. New Zealand’s International Investment Position statement\nshows, at a particular point in time, the stock of a country’s international ﬁnancial\nassets and international ﬁnancial liabilities.\nRetail Sales Ex Inﬂation\nCredit card spending numbers are released for New Zealand on a monthly basis but\nthe retail sales data is quarterly on an ex inﬂation basis. This measure tracks the\nresale of new and used goods to the public for personal or household consumption.\nIt is also an important input into GDP.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a m/m, q/q, h/h, and y/y basis. New\nZealand’s PPI data is released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 32.2 illustrates the 10-year performance of NZDUSD.\n263CHAPTER 33\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nCanadian Dollar\n(CAD)\n■Broad Economic Performance\nCanada is the world’s eleventh largest country with GDP valued at US$1.8 trillion as\nof 2014. As a resource-based economy, the country’s early economic development\nhinged on the development, exploitation, and exports of natural resources. It is\nnow the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold. However, in actuality,\nnearly two-thirds of the country’s GDP comes from the service sector, which also\nemploys three out of four Canadians. The strength in the service sector is partly\nattributed to the trend by businesses to subcontract a large portion of their services.\nThis may include a manufacturing company subcontracting delivery services to a\ntransportation company. Despite this, manufacturing and resources are still very\nimportant for the Canadian economy, as it represents over 25% of the country’s\nexports and is a primary source of income for a number of provinces.\nThe Canadian economy started to advance with the depreciation of its currency\nagainst the U.S. dollar and the Free Trade Agreement that came into effect in January\n1989. This agreement eliminated almost all trade tariffs between the United States\nand Canada. As a result, Canada now exports over 85% of its goods to the United\nStates. Further negotiations to incorporate Mexico created the North American Free\nTrade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect on January 1994. This more advanced\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)264treaty eliminated most tariffs on trading b etween all three countries. Canada’s close\ntrade relationship with the United States makes it particularly sensitive to the health\nof the U.S. economy. If the U.S. economy sputters, demand for Canadian exports\nwould suffer. The same is true for the opposite scenario; if U.S. economic growth\nis robust, Canadian exports will beneﬁt. In the past decade, trade with China has\nalso increased signiﬁcantly, rising in the ranks from the ﬁfth to the second most\nimportant trade partner for Canada. The following is a breakdown of Canada’s key\nexport and import markets:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. United Kingdom\n4. Japan\n5. Mexico\nLeading Import Sources\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Japan\n4. Mexico\n5. United Kingdom\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Governing Council of the Bank of Canada is the board that is responsible for\nsetting Canadian monetary policy. This council consists of seven members: the\ngovernor and six deputy governors. The Bank of Canada meets approximately eight\ntimes per year to discuss changes in monetary policy. They also release a monthly\nmonetary policy update every quarter, but the rate decision itself is the big market\nmover for the currency.\nCentral Bank Goals\nThe Bank of Canada’s primary focus is on maintaining the ‘‘integrity and value of\nthe currency,’’ and this involves ensuring pri ce stability. Price stability is maintained\nby adhering to an inﬂation target currently set by the Department of Finance at\n1% to 3%. The Bank believes that high inﬂation can damage the functioning of the\neconomy. In their opinion, low inﬂation on the other hand equates to price stability,\nwhich can help to foster sustainable long-term economic growth. The BoC controls\ninﬂation through short-term interest rates. If inﬂation is above the target, the Bank\nwill apply tighter monetary conditions. If it is below the target, the Bank will loosen\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)265monetary policy. Overall, the central bank has done a pretty good job of keeping\nthe inﬂation target within the band since 1998.\nThe Bank measures monetary conditions using its Monetary Conditions Index,\nwhich is a weighted sum of changes in the 90-day commercial paper rate and G-10\ntrade-weighted exchange rates. The weight of the interest rate versus the exchange\nrate is 3 to 1, which is the affect of a chan ge in interest rates on the exchange rate\nbased on historical studies. This means that a 1% increase in short-term interest\nrates is the same as a 3% appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate. To\nchange monetary policy, the BoC manipulates the Bank Rate, which can in turn\naffect the exchange rate. If the currency appreciates to undesirable levels, the BoC\ncan decrease interest rates to offset the rise. If it depreciates, the BoC can raise rates.\nHowever, interest rate changes are not used for the purposes of manipulating the\nexchange rate. Instead, they are used to control inﬂation but an excessively strong\ncurrency and lower inﬂationary pressures can accelerate the changes. The following\nare the most commonly used tools by the BoC to implement monetary policy.\nBank Rate\nThe Bank Rate is the main rate used to control inﬂation. This is the rate of interest\nthat the Bank of Canada charges to commercial banks. Changes to this rate will affect\nother interest rates, including mortgage rates and prime rates charged by commercial\nbanks. Therefore, changes to this rate will ﬁlter into the overall economy.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) is the framework for the Bank of Canada’s\nimplementation of monetary policy. It is through this framework that Canada’s\ncommercial banks borrow and lend overnight money to each other in order to fund\ntheir daily transactions. The LVTS is an electronic platform through which these\nﬁnancial institutions conduct large transactions. The interest rate charged on these\novernight loans is called the overnight rate or bank rate. The BoC can manipulate the\novernight rate by offering to lend at rates lower or higher than the current market\nrate if the overnight lending rate is trading above or below the target banks.\nOn a regular basis, the bank releases a number of publications that are important to\nfollow. This includes a biannual Monetary Policy Report that contains an assessment of\nthe current economic environment and implications for inﬂation and a quarterly Bank\nof Canada Review that includes economic commentary, featured articles, speeches by\nmembers of the Governing Council, and important announcements.\nImportant Characteristics of the Canadian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . As the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold,\nCanada’s economy is highly dependent on commodities. This creates a strong\npositive correlation between the Canadian dollar and oil prices. Generally\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)266speaking, when oil prices rise, it beneﬁts domestic producers and increases their\nincome from exports. However at the same time, strong commodity prices can\nhurt growth abroad; so while rising oil prices are initially positive for Canada,\nthe negative impact on global growth could lead to a decline in demand over the\nmedium term. On the ﬂip side, falling oil prices are negative for the Canadian\ndollar; but if prices remain low and global growth beneﬁts, it can eventually\nneutralize the negative impact.\n■Strong correlation with the United States . Since the 1980s, Canada has been running\nmerchandise trade surpluses with the United States and now approximately 77%\nof Canadian exports are bound for the Untied States. This heavy reliance on U.S.,\ndemand makes Canada extremely sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy. As the\nU.S. economy accelerates, trade increases with Canadian companies, lifting overall\neconomic activity. However, as the U.S. economy slows, the Canadian economy\nwill be hurt signiﬁcantly as U.S. companies reduce their importing activities.\n■Mergers and acquisitions . Due to the proximity of the United States and Canada,\ncross-border mergers and acquisitions are very common, as companies worldwide\nstrive for globalization. These mergers and acquisitions lead to money ﬂowing\nbetween the two countries, which ulti mately impacts the currencies. In 2001,\nthe signiﬁcant U.S. acquisition of Canadian energy companies infused US$25\nbillion into Canada. This led to a strong rally in USDCAD, as the U.S. companies\nneeded to sell USD and buy CAD to pay for their acquisitions. Any similar type\nof M&A ﬂow in the future will also have a signiﬁcant but short-term impact on\nthe Canadian dollar.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of\nCanada and the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries\nare closely watched by professional Canadian dollar traders. These differentials\ncan be good indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much\npremium yield Canadian short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, and vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Carry trades . A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. When\nCanada has a higher interest rate than th e United States, the short USDCAD carry\ntrade becomes more attractive; but if th e United States emba rks on a tightening\ncampaign or Canada lowers rates, the positive interest rate differential between\nthe Canadian dollar and other currencies would narrow. In such situations, the\nCanadian dollar could come under pressure if the speculators begin to exit out of\ntheir carry trades.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)267■Important Economic Indicators for Canada\nCanadian economic reports can have a signiﬁcant impact on the currency. Here are\na handful of the most important releases.\nCanadian Employment\nEvery month, Canada releases its labor market report and this report provides more\ndetails than that of the United States. Job growth is expressed as net job growth and\nthen split into full- and part-time hirers. Generally speaking, the market prefers that\nthe bulk of job growth is full time, because it represents real long-term employment\nand not short-term hires that can be laid off at any time. The unemployment rate is\nalso released, and the number of unemployed persons is expressed as a percentage\nof the labor force.\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\nThe monthly consumer price report measures the average rate of increase in prices.\nWhen economists speak of inﬂation as an economic problem, they generally mean\na persistent increase in the general price level over a period of time, resulting in a\ndecline in a currency’s purchasing power. Inﬂation is often measured as a percentage\nincrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Canada’s inﬂation policy, as set out\nby the federal government and the Bank of Canada, aims to keep inﬂation within\na target range of 1% to 3%. If the rate of inﬂation is 10% a year, $100 worth of\npurchases last year will, on average, cost $110 this year. At the same inﬂation rate,\nthose purchases will cost $121 next year, and so on.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nThe gross domestic product measures the total value of all goods and services\nproduced within Canada during a given year. It is a measure of the income generated\nby production within Canada. GDP is also referred to as economic output. To\navoid counting the same output more than once, GDP includes only ﬁnal goods\nand services—not those that are used to make another product. For example, GDP\nwould not include the wheat used to make bread, but would include the bread itself.\nTrade Balance\nThe balance of trade is a statement of a country’s trade in goods (merchandise) and\nservices. It covers trade in products such as manufactured goods, raw materials, and\nagricultural goods, as well as travel and transportation. The balance of trade is the\ndifference between the value of the goods and services that a country exports and\nthe value of the goods and services that it imports. If a country’s exports exceed its\nimports, it has a trade surplus and the trade balance is said to be positive. If imports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)268\nFIGURE 33.1 USDCAD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nexceed exports, the country has a trade deﬁcit, and its trade balance is said to be\nnegative.\nRetail Sales\nRetail sales is a monthly national accounts measure that calculates current expenditure\nby households and producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes\npurchases of durable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure\nby persons on the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by\nunincorporated enterprises. Stronger consumer spending is positive for Canada’s\neconomy and, in turn, the Canadian dollar, whereas weaker consumer spending is\nnegative for Canada’s economy and currency.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.\nFigure 33.1 illustrates the 10-year

        "213CHAPTER 27\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nEuro (EUR)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe European Union (EU) was developed as an institutional framework for the\nconstruction of a united Europe. As of May 2015, the EU consists of 28 member\ncountries with 19 of these nations sharing the euro as a common currency. The\nEurozone consists of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,\nGreece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,\nPortugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. With the exception of Denmark and the\nUnited Kingdom, other EU states are obliged to join the monetary union when they\nmeet the criteria to do so. Aside from a common currency, these countries also\nshare a single monetary policy dictated by the European Central Bank (ECB). These\ncommon currency countries constitute the European Monetary Union (EMU).\nThe EMU is the world’s second largest economic power, with gross domestic\nproduct valued at approximately US$18 trillion in 2014. With a highly developed\nﬁxed income, equity, and futures market, the EMU is the second most attractive\ninvestment market for domestic and international investors. In its early days, the\nEMU found difﬁculty attracting foreign direct investment or large capital ﬂows\nbecause, historically, the U.S. markets are larger with more consistent returns. As\na result, the U.S. absorbs 71% of total foreign savings. However, with the euro\nbecoming an established currency and the European Monetary Union incorporating\nmore members, the euro’s importance as a reserve currency is rising and translating\ninto greater capital ﬂows. The only problem is that European bond markets are\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)214fragmented, and there are not enough quality assets for central banks to invest in.\nUnless there are euro bonds, foreign central banks could be slow to diversify their\nreserve holdings. Nonetheless, they will do so gradually, providing ongoing support\nfor the euro.\nTrade is extremely important to Eurozone nations and most countries conduct\nthe majority of their trade with other states in the region. This is important because\none of the most valuable aspects of the euro is its facilitation of trade activity through\nthe elimination of exchange rate risk. Large Eurozone nations such as Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Spain also conduct signiﬁcant trade activity with countries like the\nUnited States and China. This makes the value of the euro particularly important\nto economic activity. A country like the United States is less sensitive to exchange\nrate ﬂuctuations because most of its demand is internal, but Europe is extremely\nsensitive to its exchange rate because many Eurozone nations rely on external\ndemand. The size and scope of the EMU’s trade with the rest of the world provides\nit with signiﬁcant power in the international trade arena. International clout is also\none of the primary goals in the formation of the European Union, because it allows\nindividual nations to negotiate as a group on an equal playing ﬁeld with the United\nStates and China, their two largest trading partners. The breakdowns of the most\nimportant trading partners for the European Union are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Switzerland\n4. Russia\n5. Turkey\nLeading Import Sources\n1. China\n2. Russia\n3. United States\n4. Norway\n5. Switzerland\nWhile trade is extremely important, the service sector has the largest share of\ntotal output followed by manufacturing. In fact, a large number of the companies\nwhose primary purpose is to produce ﬁnished products still concentrate their EU\nactivity on innovation, research, design, and marketing, while outsourcing most of\ntheir manufacturing activities to Asia.\nThe EU’s growing role in international trade has major implications for the role of\nthe euro as a reserve currency. As more countries conduct trade with the Eurozone,\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)215they will be motivated to accumulate more euros to reduce exchange risk and\ntransaction costs. Traditionally, most international trade transactions involve the\nBritish pound, the Japanese yen, and/or the U.S. dollar. Before the establishment of\nthe euro, it was unreasonable to hold large amounts of every individual EU national\ncurrency. As a result, currency reserves tended toward the dollar. At the end of the\n1990s, approximately 65% of all world reserves were held in U.S. dollars, but after\nthe introduction of the euro, foreign reserve assets slowly shifted towards the euro.\nThis trend will only continue as the world becomes more globalized.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nMakers—The European Central Bank\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is the governing body responsible for determining\nthe monetary policy of the countries participating in the EMU. The Executive Board\nof the EMU consists of the president of the ECB, the vice president of the ECB, and\nfour other members. These individuals, along with the governors of the national\ncentral banks, comprise the Governing Council. The ECB is set up such that the\nExecutive Board implements the policies dictated by the Governing Council. New\nmonetary policies decisions are typically made by majority vote, with the president\nhaving the casting vote in the event of a tie in their monthly meeting. After each\nmeeting the Central Bank president holds a press conference to answer questions.\nThis is also used as an opportunity to clarify their monetary policy stance.\nThe EMU’s primary objective is to maintain price stability and promote growth.\nMonetary and ﬁscal policy changes are made to ensure that this objective is met. With\nthe formation of the EMU, the Maastric ht Treaty was developed by the Union to\napply a number of criteria for each member country. These criteria were developed\nby the Union to help them achieve their objective. Deviations from these criteria\nby any one country will result in heavy ﬁnes. Listed below are the EMU criteria.\nIt is apparent based on these criteria that the ECB has a strict mandate focused on\ninﬂation and deﬁcit. Generally, the ECB strives to maintain annual growth in HCPI\n(Harmonized Consumer Price Index) below 2% and M3 (Money Supply) annual\ngrowth around 4.5%.\nThe EMU Criteria\nIn the 1992 Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) the following\npreconditions were created for any EU member state looking to join the economic\nand monetary union (EMU).\n■A rate of inﬂation no more than 1.5% above the average of the three best\nperforming member states, taking the average of the 12-month year-on-year rate\npreceding the assessment date.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)216■Long-term interest rates not exceeding the average rates of these low-inﬂation\nstates by more than 2% for the preceding 12 months.\n■Exchange rates which ﬂuctuate within the normal margins of the exchange-rate\nmechanism (ERM) for at least two years.\n■A general government debt/GDP ratio of not more than 60%, although a higher\nratio may be permissible if it is ‘‘sufﬁciently diminishing.’’\n■A general government deﬁcit not exceeding 3% of GDP, although a small and\ntemporary excess can be permitted.\nIf a country meets the convergence criteria and joins the EMU, their monetary\npolicy will be determined by the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB and the\nESCB (European System of Central Banks) are independent institutions from both\nnational governments and other EU institutions, granting them complete control\nover monetary policy. This operational independence is accorded to them as per\nArticle 108 of the Maastricht Treaty, which states that any member of the decision-\nmaking bodies cannot seek or take instructions from any Community Institutions,\nany government of a member state, or any other body. In other words, no one\ncountry can pressure the ECB into making a monetary policy change that is in only\ntheir best interest. The primary tools the ECB uses to control monetary policy is the\nfollowing.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe ECB has four main categories of open market operations to steer interest rates,\nmanage liquidity, and signal monetary policy stance. This includes:\n■Main reﬁnancing operations . These are regular liquidity-providing reverse transac-\ntions conducted weekly with a maturity o f two weeks, which provide the bulk of\nreﬁnancing to the ﬁnancial sector.\n■Longer-term reﬁnancing operations . These are liquidity-providing reverse transactions\nwith a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months, which provide\ncounterparties with additional longer-term reﬁnancing.\n■Fine-tuning operations . These are executed on an ad-hoc basis, with the aim of\nboth managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates, in\nparticular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected\nliquidity ﬂuctuations.\n■Structural operations . These involve the issuance of debt certiﬁcates, reverse trans-\nactions, and outright transactions. These operations will be executed whenever\nthe ECB wishes to adjust th e structural position of the Eurosystem vis-` a-vis the\nﬁnancial sector (on a regular or nonregular basis).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)217ECB Minimum Bid Rate (Repo Rate)\nThe ECB minimum bid rate is the key policy target for the ECB and the level of\nborrowing that the ECB offers to the central banks of its member states. This is also\nthe rate that is subject to change at the monthly ECB meetings. Since inﬂation is a\nmajor concern for European policy makers, they are generally more inclined to keep\ninterest rates at lofty levels to prevent inﬂation. Changes in the ECB’s minimum bid\nrate can have large ramiﬁcations for the EUR.\nThe ECB does not have an exchange rate target, but will factor in exchange rates\nin their policy deliberations because they can affect price stability. A high exchange\nrate lowers inﬂationary pressures while a low exchange rate promotes it. The ECB is\nnot prohibited from intervening in the foreign exchange markets if they believe that\ninﬂation is a concern. As a result, comments by members of the Governing Council\nare closely watched by forex traders and can have a signiﬁcant impact on the euro.\nIn addition to their monthly meetings, the Central Bank will also publish a\nmonthly bulletin and release staff forecasts and minutes from past meetings. The\npresident of the Central Bank holds a press conference after the policy meeting and\nthat, along with each of these event risk s, can cause volatility in the currency.\nNow let’s take a look at some of the important characteristics of the euro:\n■EURUSD cross is the most liquid and actively traded currency . The euro was introduced\nas an electronic currency in January 1999. At the time, the euro replaced all\npre-EMU currencies, except for Greece’s currency, which was converted to the\neuro in January 2001. As a result, the EURUSD cross is now the most liquid\ncurrency in the world and its movements are used as the primary gauge of the\nhealth of both the European and U.S. economies. Figure 27.1 highlights the\n10 year performance of EUR-USD. The euro is most frequently known as the\n‘‘anti-dollar’’ since dollar or U.S. fundamentals generally have a greater impact\non the movement of the currency.\nEURJPY and EURCHF are also very liquid currencies that can be used as a\ngauge of the health of the Japanese and Swiss economies. Many new traders will\nstart with the EURUSD because of its orderly movements, tight spread, and\nliquidity.\n■Euro: A currency without a country . One of the greatest problems of the euro is that it\nis currency without a country. Instead, it bears the economic, political, and social\nrisks of 19 different nations. This is its gr eatest strength and its greatest weakness.\nIn the past decade, we have seen how the debt crisis in smaller Eurozone nations\nhave affected the currency as a whole. It undermines conﬁdence and has, on many\noccasions, put the entire monetary union at risk.\n■Spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and 10-year Bunds can indicate euro sentiment .\nTen-year government bonds can serve as an important indicator of where the euro\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)218\nFIGURE 27.1 EURUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)219is headed, especially against the U.S. dollar. The differential between the 10-year\nU.S. government bond and the 10-year German Bund rates can provide a good\nindication for EURUSD’s movement. If Bund rates are higher than U.S. Treasury\nrates and the differential increases, or the spread widens, this is generally positive\nfor the EURUSD. Alternatively, a decrease in the differential or a tightening of\nthe interest rates is generally bearish for EURUSD. As there is no Euro bond,\nthe 10-year German Bund yield is typically used as the benchmark bond for the\nEurozone because Germany is the largest country in the monetary union.\n■Predictions for euro area money ﬂows . Another useful rate to follow is the three-month\ninterest rate, also known as the euro interbank offer rate or the Euribor rate. This\nis the rate offered from one large bank to another on interbank term deposits.\nTraders tend to compare the Euribor futures rate with the Eurodollar futures rate.\nEurodollars are deposits denominated in U.S. dollars at banks and other ﬁnancial\ninstitutions outside the United States. Because investors like high-yielding assets,\nEuropean ﬁxed-income assets become more attractive as the spread between\nEuribor futures and Eurodollar futures widens in favor of Euribors. As the spread\nnarrows, European assets become less attractive, whereby implying a potential\ndecrease in money ﬂows into the Euro.\nMergers and acquisition activity can also affect how the EURUSD moves.\nIn recent years we have seen increased M&A activity between EU and U.S.\nmultinationals. Large deals, especially with a large cash component, can lead to a\nsudden burst in the EURUSD, but the reaction is generally short-lived.\n■Important Indicators for the Euro\nWhen it comes to Eurozone economic reports, the only ones that affect the euro are\nGerman or Eurozone data. The largest countries in the Eurozone in order of GDP\ncontribution are Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. While French and Italian data\nare important, they rarely move the currency. So what forex traders should focus on\nare the broader regional reports and German data. Central bank rate decisions are\nthe most important, but here are some additional economic reports that can have\nmeaningful impact on the currency.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the Manufacturing\nand Service sectors. For the Eurozone, they provide this data for the four largest\neconomies and a composite index for the region. These numbers are extremely\nmarket moving because they provide the most up-to-date information on how each\nof the economies are performing in the current month and not how the economies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)220performed the previous month like many other reports. However, since the reports\nare for the current period, they are usually subject to revisions so the euro will\nmove on the preliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents\nexpansion, and a reading below 50 represents contraction. For the Eurozone, the\nmanufacturing PMI index is the most important along with the composite index,\nwhich aggregates how the manufacturing and service sector are performing. Since\nthe German data are released shortly before the Eurozone report, they can have a\ngreater impact on the currency.\nIFO Survey\nGermany is by far the largest economy in Europe and is responsible for approximately\n20% of total GDP. Any insight into German business conditions is seen as an insight\ninto Europe as a whole. The IFO is a monthly survey conducted by the IFO institute.\nThey survey over 7,000 German businesses, asking for their assessment of the\nGerman business climate and their short-term plans. The initial publication of the\nresults consists of the business climate headline ﬁgure and its two equally weighted\nsubindices: current business conditions and business expectations. The typical range\nis from 80 to 120, with a higher number indicating greater business conﬁdence. The\nreport is most valuable, however, when measured against previous data.\nInﬂation Indicators—HICP\nSince the ECB has an inﬂation mandate, the EU Harmonized Index of Consumer\nPrices (HICP) published by Eurostat is very important. This harmonized index is\ndesigned for international comparison as required by EU law. The index is compiled\nwith information on prices retrieved by each national statistical agency. Individual\ncountries are required to provide Eurostat with the 100 indices used to compute the\nHICP. The national HICPs are totaled by Eurostat as a weighted average of these\nsubindices, and the weights used are country-speciﬁc. The HICP is released at the\nend of the month following the reference period, which is about 10 days after the\npublications of the national CPIs from Spain and France, the ﬁnal EMU-5 countries\nto release their CPIs. Even if part of the information is already known when the\nHICP is released, it is an important release because it serves as the reference inﬂation\nindex for the ECB who aims to keep Eurozone consumer price inﬂation between\n0% and 2%.\nGerman Industrial Production\nIndustrial production data are seasonally adjusted (SA) and include a breakdown into\nfour major subcategories: mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction. The\nmanufacturing aggregate comprises four main product groups: basic and producer\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)221goods, capital goods, consumer durables, and consumer nondurables. The market\ntends to pay attention to the annual rate of change and the seasonally adjusted\nmonth-on-month ﬁgure. Germany’s ﬁgure is most important since it is the largest\ncountry in the Eurozone; however, the market can also react to the French industrial\nproduction report. The initial industrial production release is based on a narrower\ndata sample and hence subject to revision when the full sample has become available.\nThe ministry occasionally provides insight on the expected direction of the revision\nin the initial data release.\nGerman Unemployment\nLabor market numbers are important for every country and in the case of the\nEurozone, German unemployment is the most important. Released by the Labor\nOfﬁce, the data contain information on the number of unemployed, as well as\nthe changes on the previous month, on both seasonally (SA) and nonseasonally\n(NSA) adjusted terms. The NSA unemployment rate is provided, along with data\non vacancies, short-shift working arrangements, and the number of employees\n(temporarily suspended in 1999). Within an hour after the FLO release, the\nBundesbank releases the SA unemployment rate. The day ahead of the release,\nthere is often a leak of the ofﬁcial data from a trade-union source. The leak is\nusually of the NSA level of unemployment in millions. When a precise ﬁgure is\nreported on Reuters, as given by ‘‘sources’’ for the NSA level of unemployment,\nthe leak usually reﬂects t he ofﬁcial ﬁgures. Rumors often circulate up to one week\nbefore the ofﬁcial release, and they are notoriously imprecise. Regardless, a drop\nin unemployment along with an improvement in the jobless rate is positive for the\ncurrency, whereas a rise in jobless claims or increase in the unemployment rate is\nnegative for the currency.\nPreliminary GDP\nPreliminary GDP is issued when Eurostat has collected data from a sufﬁcient number\nof countries to produce an estimate. This usually includes France, Germany, and\nthe Netherlands. However, Italy is not included in the preliminary release and is\nonly added in the ﬁnal number. The yearly aggregates for EU-15 and EMU-11\nare a simple sum of national GDP. For the quarterly accounts, the aggregation is\nmore complex since some countries (Greece, Ireland, and Luxembourg) do not\nyet produce quarterly national accounts data. Moreover, Portugal produces only\npartial quarterly accounts with a signiﬁcant lag. Thus, both the EU-15 and EMU-11\nquarterly paths are the result of estimates from quarterly data based on a group of\ncountries accounting for more than 95% of total EU GDP (see the Foreword for a\ndetailed description of the weights of each country in the EU).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)222M3\nM3 is a broad measure of money supply, which includes everything from notes\nand coins to bank deposits. The ECB closely monitors M3 as they view it as a key\nmeasure of inﬂation. At its session in December 1998, the governing council of the\nECB set its ﬁrst reference value for M3 growth at 4.5%. This value supports inﬂation\nb e l o w2 % ,t r e n dg r o w t ho f2 %t o2 . 5 % ,a n dal o n g - t e r md e c l i n ei nt h ev e l o c i t y\nof money by 0.5% to 1%. The growth rate is monitored on a three-month moving\naverage basis in order to prevent monthly volatility to distort the information given\nby the aggregate. The ECB’s approach to monetary targeting leaves considerable\nroom for maneuver and interpretation. Because the ECB does not impose bands\non M3 growth, as the Bundesbank used to do, there will be no automatic action\nwhen M3 growth diverges from the reference value. Moreover, although the ECB\nconsiders M3 to be the key indicator, it will also take into account the changes in\nother monetary aggregates.\nIndividual Country Budget Deﬁcits\nThe Stability and Growth Pact states that budget deﬁcits for every country in the\nmonetary union must be kept below 3% of GDP. Failure to meet these targets will\nbe punished. However through the years many Eurozone nations have had deﬁcits\nin excess of 3% and penalties have not been enforced.\n223CHAPTER 28\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nBritish Pound (GBP)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe United Kingdom is the world’s ﬁfth largest economy with GDP valued at\napproximately US$3 trillion in 2014 according to the IMF. With one of the most\ndynamic central banks in the world, the UK economy beneﬁted from many years of\nstrong growth, low unemployment, expa nding output, and resilient consumption.\nThe strength of consumer consumption has been largely due to the strong housing\nmarket. The United Kingdom is a service-oriented economy, with manufacturing\nrepresenting an increasingly smaller portion of GDP, now equivalent to only one-\nﬁfth of national output. Their capital market system is one of the most developed\nin the world, with ﬁnance and banking being the strongest contributors to GDP.\nAlthough the majority of the UK’s GDP is from services, it is also one of the\nlargest producers and exporters of natural gas in the European Union. The energy\nproduction industry accounts for 10% of GDP, which is one of the highest shares of\nany industrialized nation. This is particularly important, as increases in energy prices\n(such as oil) will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt the large number of UK oil exporters. (The\nUnited Kingdom became a net oil importer for a brief period due to disruptions in\nthe North Sea in 2003, but it has already resumed its status as a net oil exporter.)\nOverall, the United Kingdom is a net importer of goods with a consistent\ntrade deﬁcit. Its largest trading partner is the EU, with trade between the two\nconstituencies accounting for over 50% of all of the country’s import and export\nactivities. The United States, on an individual basis, still remains the United\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)224Kingdom’s largest trading partner. The breakdowns of the most important trading\npartners for the United Kingdom are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. Germany\n3. Switzerland\n4. Netherlands\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Netherlands\n3. China\n4. United States\n5. France\nSince the launch of the euro in 1999, the single currency’s troubles have become\nincreasingly apparent, and this has made the UK’s decision to maintain its own\ncurrency and monetary authority increasingly intelligent. Yet the possibility of euro\nadoption will remain a question in the minds of pound traders for many years\nto come, although in 2015 into 2016, the more relevant question is whether the\nUnited Kingdom will remain in the EMU. A decision on euro entry has signiﬁcant\nramiﬁcations for the UK economy—the most important of which is that UK interest\nrates would have to be adjusted to reﬂect the equivalent interest rate of the Eurozone.\nOne of the primary arguments against adopting the euro is that the UK government\nhas sound macroeconomic policies that have worked very well for the country for\ndecades. Its successful monetary and ﬁscal policies have led it to outperform most\nmajor economies during economic downturns, including the European Union.\nThe UK Treasury has previously speciﬁed ﬁve economic tests that must be met\nprior to euro entry, which are the following:\nUK’s Five Economic Tests for Euro\n1. Is there sustainable convergence in business cycles and economic structures\nbetween the United Kingdom and other EMU members, so that the UK citizens\ncould live comfortably with euro interest rates on a permanent basis?\n2. Is there enough ﬂexibility to cope with economic change?\n3. Would joining the EMU create an environment that would encourage ﬁrms to\ninvest in the United Kingdom?\n4. Would joining the EMU have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the\nUK’s ﬁnancial services industry?\n5. Would joining the EMU be good for promoting stability and growth in\nemployment?\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)225The United Kingdom is a very political country where government ofﬁcials are\nhighly concerned with voter approval. If voters do not support euro entry, the\nlikelihood of EMU entry would decline. The following are some of the arguments\nfor and against adopting the euro:\nArguments in Favor of Adopting the Euro\n■There would be reduced exchange rate uncertainty for UK businesses and lower\nexchange rate transa ction costs or risks.\n■The prospect of sustained low inﬂation under the governance of the European\nCentral Bank should reduce long-term interest rates and stimulate sustained\neconomic growth.\n■Single currency promotes price transparency.\n■The integration of national ﬁnancial markets of the EU will lead to higher efﬁciency\nin the allocation of capital in Europe.\n■The euro is the second most important reserve currency after the USD.\n■With the United Kingdom joining the euro, the political clout of the EMU would\nincrease dramatically.\nArguments against Adopting the Euro\n■Currency unions have collapsed in the past.\n■Economic or political instabilities of one country would impact the Euro, which\nwould have exchange rate ramiﬁcations for otherwise healthy countries.\n■Strict EMU criteria outlined by the Stability and Growth Pact.\n■Entry would mean a permanent transfer of domestic monetary authority to the\nEuropean Central Bank.\n■Joining a currency union with no monetary ﬂexibility would require the United\nKingdom to have more ﬂexibility in the labor and housing markets.\n■There are fears about which countries might dominate the ECB.\n■Adjusting to new currency will require large transaction costs.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Bank\nof England\nFor the United Kingdom, the Bank of England (BoE) controls monetary policy, and\nthe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is a nine-member committee responsible\nfor setting interest rate policy in the United Kingdom. It consists of a governor,\ntwo deputy governors, two executive directors of the central bank, and four outside\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)226experts. The committee was granted operational independence in 1997, which\nmeans they won’t be inﬂuenced by the governing party. Despite this independence,\nmonetary policies have centered on achieving an inﬂation target dictated by the\nChancellor of the Treasury. Currently, this target is RPIX (Retail Price Index)\ninﬂation of 2.5%. The central bank has the power to change interest rates to levels\nthat will allow them to meet this target. The MPC holds monthly meetings, which\nare closely followed for announcements on changes in monetary policy, including\nchanges in the interest rate (bank repo rate). When no changes are made, no details\nare provided. In this case, the rate decision is generally a nonevent for the currency,\nwith traders shifting their focus to the minutes released two weeks later.\nThe MPC publishes statements after every meeting, along with a quarterly\nInﬂation Report that details the MPC’s two-year forecast for growth and inﬂation\nalong with justiﬁcation for policy movements. In addition, another publication,\ntheQuarterly Bulletin, provides information on past monetary policy movements\nand analysis of the international economic environment and its impacts on the UK\neconomy. All of these reports can provide guidance of future policy changes. The\nmain policy tools used by the MPC and BoE are the following.\nBank Repo Rate\nThis is the key rate used in monetary policy to meet the Treasury’s inﬂation target.\nThis rate is set for the Bank’s own operati ons in the market, such as its short-term\nlending activities. Changes to this rate affect the rates set by the commercial banks\nfor their savers and borrowers. In turn, this rate will affect spending and output in\nthe economy, and eventually costs and prices. An increase in this rate would imply\nan attempt to curb inﬂation and slow growth, while a decrease in this rate would be\naimed at stimulating growth and expansion.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe goal of open market operations is to implement changes in the bank repo rate,\nwhile assuring adequate liquidity in the market and continued stability in the banking\nsystem. This is reﬂective of the three main objectives of the BoE: maintaining the\nintegrity and value of the currency, maintaining the stability of the ﬁnancial system,\nand seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the United Kingdom’s ﬁnancial services.\nTo ensure liquidity, the Bank conducts daily open market operations to buy or sell\nshort-term government ﬁxed-income instruments. If this is not sufﬁcient to meet\nliquidity needs, the Bank would also conduct additional overnight operations.\nImportant Characteristics of the British Pound\n■GBPUSD is very liquid . The GBPUSD is one of the most liquid currencies in the\nworld, with 6% of all currency trading involving the British pound as either\nthe base or counter currency. It is also one of the three most liquid currencies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)227alongside EURUSD and USDJPY. One of the reasons for the currency’s liquidity\nis the country’s highly developed capital markets. Many foreign investors seeking\nopportunities other than the United States have sent their funds to the United\nKingdom for investment. In order to create these transactions, foreigners will\nneed to sell their local currency and buy British pounds.\n■GBP has three names . The UK’s currency has three names: the British pound,\nsterling, and cable. All of these are used interchangeably.\n■GBP is laden with speculators . At the time of publication, the British pound has one\nof the highest interest rates among the developed nations. Although Australia\nand New Zealand have higher interest rates, their ﬁnancial markets are not as\ndeveloped as that of the United Kingdom. As a result, many investors who already\nhave positions or are interested in initiating new carry trades positions frequently\nuse the GBP as the lending currency and will go long the pound against currencies\nsuch as the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. A carry trade involves\nbuying or lending a currency with a higher interest and selling or borrowing a\ncurrency with a lower interest rate. In recent years, carry trades have increased in\npopularity, which helped spur demand for the British pound. However, should the\ninterest rate yield differential bet ween the pound and other currencies narrow,\nan exodus of carry traders will increase volatility in the British pound.\n■Interest rate differentials between Gilt s and foreign bonds ar e closely followed . Interest rate\ndifferentials between UK Gilts—U.S. Tr easuries and UK Gilts and German Bunds\nare widely watched by FX market participants. Gilts versus Treasuries can be a\nbarometer of GBPUSD ﬂows, while Gilts versus Bunds can be used as a barometer\nfor EURGBP ﬂows. More speciﬁcally, these interest rate differentials indicate how\nmuch premium yield UK ﬁxed-income assets are offering over U.S. and European\n(German Bunds are usually used as a barometer for European yield) ﬁxed-income\nassets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders with indications of potential\ncapital ﬂow or currency movements, as global investors are always shifting their\ncapital in search of the assets with the highest yields. The United Kingdom can\nprovide these yields with the safety of having the same credit stability as the United\nStates.\n■Euro sterling futures can give indications for interest rate movements .S i n c et h eU K\ninterest rate or bank repo rate is the primary tool used in monetary policy, it is\nimportant to keep abreast of potential changes to the interest rate. Comments\nfrom government ofﬁcials is one way to gauge biases for potential rate changes,\nbut the Bank of England is one of the only central banks that requires members\nof the Monetary Policy Committee to publish their speciﬁc voting records.\nThis personal accountability indicates that comments by individual committee\nmembers represent their own opinions and not that of the BoE. Therefore,\nit is necessary to look for other indication of potential BoE rate movements.\nThree-month euro sterling futures reﬂect market expectations on euro sterling\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)228\nFIGURE 28.1 GBPUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\ninterest rates three months into the future. These contracts are also useful in\npredicting UK interest rate changes, which will ultimately affect the ﬂuctuations\nof the GBPUSD. Figure 28.1 illustrates 10 year performance of GBP-USD.\n■Comments on euro by UK politicians will impact the euro . Any speeches, remarks\n(especially from the Prime Minister or Treasury Chancellor), or polls in regards\nto the euro will impact currency trade. Indication of adoption of the euro tends\nto put downward pressure on GBP, while further opposition to euro entry will\ntypically boost the GBP. Reason being that in order for the GBP to come in line\nwith the euro, interest rates would have to decline and monetary policy would\nhave to be subjected to a foreign entity. A decrease in the interest rate would\ninduce carry trade investors to close their positions or sell pounds. The GBPUSD\nwould also decline because of the uncertainties involved with Euro adoption. The\nUK economy is performing very well under the direction of its current monetary\nauthority. The EMU is currently encountering many difﬁculties with member\ncountries breaching EMU criteria. With one monetary authority dictating 19\ncountries (plus UK would be 20), the EMU has yet to prove that they have\ndeveloped a monetary policy suitable for all member states.\n■GBP has positive correlation with energy prices . The UK houses some of the largest\nenergy companies in the world, including British Petroleum. Energy production\nrepresents 10% of GDP. As a result, the British pound tends to have a positive\ncorrelation with energy prices. Speciﬁcally, since many members of the EU\nimport oil from the United Kingdom, as oil prices increase, they will, in turn,\nhave to buy more pounds to fund their energy purchases. In addition, rises in the\nprice of oil will also beneﬁt the earnings of the nations’ energy exporters.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)229■GBP crosses . Although the GBP/USD is a more liquid currency than EURGBP,\nEURGBP is typically the leading gauge for GBP strength. The GBPUSD currency\npair tends to be more sensitive to U.S. developments, while EURGBP is a\nmore pure fundamental pound trade since Europe is Britain’s primary trade\nand investment partner. However, both currencies are naturally interdependent,\nwhich means movements in the EURGBP can affect movements in the GBPUSD.\nThe reverse is also true—that is, movements in GBPUSD will also affect trading\nin EURGBP. Therefore, it is important for pound traders to be consciously aware\nof the trading behavior of both currency pairs. The EURGBP rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURUSD divided by the GBPUSD rate. Small differences in\nthese rates are often exploited by market participants and quickly eliminated.\n■Important Economic Indicators\nfor the United Kingdom\nAll of the following indicators are important for the United Kingdom. However,\nsince the United Kingdom is primarily a service-oriented economy, it is particularly\nimportant to pay attention to service sector data.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the manufacturing,\nservice, and construction sectors. These numbers are extremely market moving\nbecause they provide the most up-to-date information on how each of the economies\nis performing in the current month and not how the economies performed\nthe previous month, like many other reports. However since the reports are for the\ncurrent period, they are usually subject to revisions, so the euro will move on the\npreliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents expansion, and a\nreading below 50 represents contraction. For the United Kingdom, the PMI services\nindex is the most important, along with the composite index, which aggregates how\nthe manufacturing and service sector are performing.\nEmployment Situation\nThe employment report is a monthly survey of the labor market conducted by\nthe Ofﬁce of National Statistics. The obj ectives of the survey are to divide the\nworking-age population into three separate classiﬁcations (employed, unemployed,\nand not in the labor force), and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of\nthese categories. Data from the survey provide market participants with information\non major labor market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors,\nhours worked, labor force participation, and unemployment rates. The timeliness\nof the survey makes it a closely watched s tatistic by the currency market as it is a\ngood barometer of the strength of the UK economy and an important input into\nmonetary policy.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)230Retail Sales\nThe key to growth is consumer spending, and for this reason, the retail sales report\nis also extremely market moving. The Retail Sales Index measures the total goods\nsold by a sampling of retail stores over the course of a month. This index is used as\na gauge of consumer consumption and consumer conﬁdence. While retail sales can\nbe quite volatile due to seasonality, it is one of the most important indicators on the\nhealth of the economy, along with a key input for GDP.\nConsumer or Retail Price Index\nCPI or RPI is a measure of the change in prices of a basket of consumer goods. The\nmarkets however focus on the underlying RPI or RPI-X, which excludes mortgage\ninterest payments. The RPI-X is closely watc hed as the treasury sets inﬂation targets\nfor the BoE, currently deﬁned as 2.5% annual growth in RPI-X.\nGDP\nGDP is a quarterly report conducted by the Bureau of Statistics. GDP is a measure\nof the total production and consumption of goods and services in the UK. GDP\nis measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses, government, and\nnet foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert output measured\nat current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used to gauge where in\nthe business cycle the United Kingdom ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is perceived\nas inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or weak\ngrowth.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures the change in output in the United\nKingdom of manufacturing; mining and quarrying; and electricity, gas, and water\nsupply. Output refers to the physical quantity of items produced, unlike sales value,\nwhich combines quantity and price. The index covers the production of goods and\npower for domestic sales in the United Kingdom and for export. Because IP is\nresponsible for close to a quarter of gross domestic product, IP is widely watched as\nit can provide good insight into the current state of the economy.\nUK Housing Starts\nHousing starts measures the number of residential building construction projects\nthat have begun during any particular month. This is important for the United\nKingdom as the housing market is the primary industry that sustains the economy.\n231CHAPTER 29\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nSwiss Franc (CHF)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nSwitzerland is the twentieth largest economy in the world, with a GDP valued at\nover US$685 billion as of 2014. Although the economy is relatively small, it is one of\nthe wealthiest in the world on a GDP per capita basis. The country is prosperous and\ntechnologically advanced with economic and political stability that rivals many larger\neconomies. The country’s prosperity stems primarily from technological expertise\nin manufacturing, tourism, and banking. More speciﬁcally, Switzerland is known for\ntheir chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, machinery, precision instruments,\nwatches, and a ﬁnancial system historically known for protecting the conﬁdentiality\nof its investors. This coupled with the country’s lengthy history of political neutrality\nearned Switzerland the Swiss franc safe haven status and as a direct result of that,\nit is the one world’s most popular destinations for offshore capital. Even when the\ncentral bank introduced a temporary 1.20 EURCHF peg and lowered interest rates\nto negative levels, Switzerland stil l managed to attract safe haven ﬂows.\nIt is estimated that Switzerland holds over US$2 trillion in offshore assets as of\n2014 and attracts over 35% of the world’s private wealth management business.\nA large and highly advanced banking and insurance industry has developed to support\nthis demand, and the sector employs over 50% of the population and comprises over\n70% of total GDP. Since Switzerland’s ﬁnancial industry thrives on its safe haven\nstatus and renowned conﬁdentiality, capital ﬂows tend to drive the economy during\ntimes of global risk aversion, while trade ﬂows drive the economy in a risk-seeking\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)232environment. Trade ﬂows are extremely important, with nearly two thirds of all\ntrade conducted with Europe. With this in mind, Switzerland’s most important\ntrading partners a re the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Germany\n2. India\n3. United States\n4. Hong Kong\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Italy\n3. United States\n4. France\n5. China\nTraditionally, Switzerland has a strong trade and current account surplus that\nlends support to the currency. Most of the surplus can be attributed to the large\namount of foreign direct investment into the country, in seek of safety of capital,\ndespite the low to negative yields offered by Switzerland.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Swiss\nNational Bank\nMonetary policy in Switzerland is determined by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). They\nare a completely independent authority with a three-person committee responsible\nfor determining monetary policy. This committee consists of a chairman, a vice\nchairman, and one other (member) who constitute the Governing Board of the\nSNB. Due to the small size of the committee, all decisions are based on a consensus\nvote. The Board reviews monetary policy at least once a quarter, but decisions on\nmonetary policy can be made and announced at any point in time. Unlike most other\ncentral banks, the SNB does not set one ofﬁcial interest rate target, but instead sets\na target range for their three-month Swiss Libor rate.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nIn December of 1999, the SNB shifted from focusing on monetary targets (M3) to an\ninﬂation target of less than 2% inﬂation per year. This measure is taken based on the\nnational consumer price index. Monetary targets still remain important indicators\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)233and are closely watched by the central bank, because they provide information on\nthe long-term inﬂation. This new inﬂation focus also increases the central bank’s\ntransparency. In their mandate, they have clearly stated, ‘‘Should inﬂation exceed\n2% in the medium term, the National Bank will tend to tighten its monetary stance.’’\nIf there is danger of deﬂation, the National Bank would loosen monetary policy. The\nSNB also closely monitors exchange rates, as excessive strength in the Swiss franc\ncan cause inﬂationary conditions. This is especially true in environments of global\nrisk aversion, as capital ﬂows into Switzerland increases signiﬁcantly during those\ntimes. As a result, the SNB typically favors a weak franc, and is not hesitant to use\nintervention as liquidity tool. SNB ofﬁcials intervene in the franc using a variety of\nmethods including verbal remarks on liquidity, money supply, and the currency.\nTheir Tools\nThe most commonly used tools by the SNB to implement monetary policy include\nthe following.\nTarget Interest Rate Range\nTraditionally, the SNB implements monetary policy by setting a target range for\ntheir three-month interest rate known as the Swiss Franc Libor rate. According\nto the SNB, ‘‘The Libor is a reference inte rest rate in the interbank market for\nunsecured loans.’’ It is a trimmed mean of the rates charged by 12 leading banks and\nis published daily by the British Bankers’ Association. The National Bank publishes\nits target range regularly. As a rule, this range extends over 1 percentage point,\nand the SNB generally aims to keep the Libor in the middle of the range. The SNB\nundertakes quarterly economic and monetary assessments at which it reviews its\nmonetary policy. If circumstances so require, it will also adjust the Libor target\nrange in between these quarterly assessments. It sets out the reasons for its decisions\nin press releases.\nOpen Market Operations\nRepo transactions are the SNB’s major monetary policy instrument. A repo\ntransaction involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider\n(lender), while agreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity\nat a later date. This structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker\nmust pay the cash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short\nmaturities ranging from one day to a few weeks. The SNB uses these repo transactions\nto manipulate undesirable moves in the three-month Libor rate. To prevent increases\nin the three-month Libor rate above the SNB’s target, the bank would supply the\ncommercial banks with additional liquidity through repo transactions at lower repo\nrates, and in essence create additional liquidity. Conversely, the SNB can reduce\nliquidity or induce increases in the three-month Libor rate by increasing repo rates.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)234In addition to the quarterly monetary policy decision, the SNB publishes a\nQuarterly Bulletin with a detailed assessment of the current state of the economy\nand a review of monetary policy. A Monthly Bulletin is also published containing a\nshort review of economic developments. These reports are important to watch, as\nthey may contain information on changes in the SNB’s assessment of economy and\nguidance on monetary policy.\n1.20 EUR/CHF Peg Implementation and Abandonment\nFew would have expected that one of the seminal developments in the forex market\nwas the Swiss National Bank’s decision to implement and later abandon its 1.20\nEURCHF peg. This decision transformed the foreign exchange industry, bankrupted\nmany brokers, and led to tighter regulations across the globe. Faced with a high level\nof uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued currency and deﬂation risks\nin 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At\nthe time, it pledged to sell francs in an unlimited quantity to maintain the peg. The\ngoal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping the gain in the franc. However,\nin January 2015, the prospect of quantitative easing from the European Central\nBank pushed the SNB to abandon the peg. It also accumulated signiﬁcant foreign\nexchange reserves that irritated critics, but more importantly, the franc became less\novervalued through the years, giving the SNB fewer reasons to maintain the peg.\nSNB’s decision was a complete surprise, and caused a 30% drop in EURCHF in\na single day. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\n■Important Characteristics of the Swiss Franc\n■Safe haven status . This is perhaps the most unique characteristic of the Swiss franc.\nSwitzerland’s safe haven status is continually stressed because this and the secrecy\nof the banking system are the key advantages of Switzerland. The Swiss franc\nmoves primarily on external events rather than domestic economic conditions.\nThat is, as mentioned earlier, due to its political neutrality, the franc is considered\nthe world’s premier safe haven currency. Therefore, in times of global instability\nand/or uncertainty, investors tend to be more concerned with capital retention\nthan appreciation. At such times, funds will ﬂow into Switzerland, which would\ncause the Swiss franc to appreciate regardless of whether growth conditions are\nfavorable.\n■Swiss franc is closely correlated with gold . Switzerland is the world’s third largest\nofﬁcial holder of gold. In the past, a Swiss constitutional mandate required the\ncurrency to be backed 40% with gold reserves. The mandate is now removed\nbut the positive correlation between the Swiss franc and gold remains because\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)235the relationship has been engrained into the minds of forex traders; therefore,\nboth gold and the Swiss franc are perceived as safe haven instruments. Before the\nSNB abandoned the EURCHF 1.20, Swiss franc had an 80% positive correlation\nwith gold. These days, the correlation is still there but in a smaller magnitude.\nGenerally speaking, if the price of gold appreciates, the Swiss franc has a high\nlikelihood of rising in value. In addition, since gold is also viewed as the ultimate\nsafe haven form of money, both gold and the Swiss franc beneﬁt during periods\nof global economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n■Carry trades effects . With one of the lowest interest rates in the industrialized world,\nover the past few years, the Swiss franc has become one of the most popular\nfunding currencies for carry trades. As mentioned in this book, the popularity of\ncarry trades has increased signiﬁcantly over the past two decades, as investors are\nactively seeking high yield. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency\nwith a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest\nrate. With CHF having one of the lowest interest rates of all industrialized\ncountries, it is one of the primary currencies sold or borrowed in carry trades.\nThis results in the need to sell CHF against a higher yielding currency. Carry\ntrades are typically done in cross-currencies such as GBPCHF or AUDCHF, but\nthese trades can impact both EURCHF and USDCHF. The unwinding of carry\ntrades involves the need for investors to buy back the Swiss franc.\n■Interest rate differentials between euro Swiss futures and foreign interest rate futures are\nclosely followed . One of the favorite indicators of professional Swiss franc traders\nis the interest rate differential bet ween three-month euro Swiss futures and\neurodollar futures. These differentials can provide guidance on potential money\nﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield U.S. ﬁxed-income assets are\noffering over Swiss ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides\ntraders with indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always\nlooking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry\ntraders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate\ndifferentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Potential changes in banking regulations . Over the past few years members of the\nEuropean Union have been exerting signiﬁcant pressure on Switzerland to relax\nthe conﬁdentiality of their banking system and to increase transparency of their\ncustomers’ accounts. The European Union is pressing this issue because of its\nactive measures to persecute EU tax evaders. This should be a concern for many\nyears to come. However, this is a difﬁcult decision for Switzerland to make because\nthe conﬁdentiality of their customers’ accounts represents the core strength of\ntheir banking system. The EU has threatened to impose severe sanctions on\nSwitzerland if they do not comply with their proposed measures. Both countries\nare currently working to negotiate an equitable resolution. Any news or talk of\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)236changing banking regulations will impact both Switzerland’s economy and the\nSwiss franc.\n■Mergers and acquisition activity . Switzerland’s primary industry is banking and\nﬁnance. In this industry, merger and acquisition activities (M&A) are very\ncommon, especially as consolidation continues in the overall industry. As a result,\nthese M&A activities can have signiﬁcant impact on the Swiss franc. If foreign\nﬁrms purchase Swiss banks or insurance companies, they will need to buy Swiss\nfrancs and in turn, sell their local currency. If Swiss banks purchase foreign ﬁrms,\nthey would need to sell Swiss francs and buy the foreign currency. Either way,\nit is important for Swiss franc traders to frequently watch for notices on M&A\nactivity involving Swiss ﬁrms.\n■Trading behavior, cross currency characteristics . The EURCHF is the most commonly\ntraded currency for traders who want to participate in CHF movements. USDCHF\nis less frequently traded because of its greater illiquidity and volatility. However,\nday traders may tend to favor USDCHF over EURCHF because of its volatile\nmovements. In actuality, the USDCHF is a synthetic currency derived from\nEURUSD and EURCHF because more tra nsactions are done between the euro\nand Swiss franc. Market makers or professional traders tend to use those pairs as\nleading indicators for trading USDCHF or to price the current USDCHF level\nwhen the currency pair is illiquid. Theoretically, the USDCHF rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURCHF rate divided by EURUSD. Only during times of\nunusual circumstances, such as the Iraq War, September 11, or the EURCHF peg,\nwill USDCHF develop a market of its own. Any small differences in these rates\nare quickly exploited by market participants. Figure 29.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of EUR-CHF.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Switzerland\nEconomic data from Switzerland tends to have limited impact on the currency, but\nthese are the most important pieces of Swiss data.\nKoF Leading Indicators\nThe KoF leading indicators report is released by the Swiss Institute for Business\nCycle Research. This index is generally used to gauge the future health of the\nSwiss economy. It contains six components: (1) change in manufacturers’ orders;\n(2) the expected purchase plans of manufacturers over the next three months; (3)\nthe judgment of stocks in wholesale business; (4) consumer perception of their\nﬁnancial conditions; (5) backlog in the construction sector; and (6) orders backlog\nfor manufacturers.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)\nk\nk237\nk\nk\nFIGURE 29.1 EURCHF 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)238Consumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index is calculated monthly, on the basis of retail prices paid in\nSwitzerland. In accordance with prevalent international practice, the commodities\ncovered are distinguished according to the consumption concept, which includes in\nthe calculation of the CPI of those goods and services that are part of the private\nconsumption aggregate according to the National Accounts. The basket of goods does\nnot include transfer expenditure such as direct taxation, social insurance contributions,\nand health insurance premiums. The index is a key measure of inﬂation.\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services in\nthe Switzerland. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Switzerland ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nBalance of Payments\nBalance of payments is the collective term for the accounts of Swiss transactions\nwith the rest of the world. The current account is the balance of trade plus services\nportion. BoP is an important indicator for Swiss traders, as Switzerland has always\nkept a strong current account balance. Any changes to the current account, positive\nor negative, could see substantial ﬂows.\nProduction Index (Industrial Production)\nThe production index is a quarterly measure of the change in the volume of industrial\nproduction (or physical output by producers).\nRetail Sales\nSwitzerland’s retail sales report is released on a monthly basis 40 days after the\nreference month. The report is an important indicator of consumer spending habits\nand is not seasonally adjusted.\n239CHAPTER 30\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nJapanese Yen (JPY)\n■Economic Overview\nJapan is the third largest economy in the world with GDP valued at over US$4.6\ntrillion in 2014 (behind the United States and China). If we count the European\nUnion as a whole, it would be considered the fourth largest economy. Japan is one of\nthe world’s largest exporters and is responsible for over US$690 billion in exports\nper year. Manufacturing and exports of products such as electronics and cars are the\nsignature drivers of the economy, accounting for nearly 17% of GDP. As a result,\nJapanese growth is extremely sensitive to the value of the currency. For many years,\nJapan has maintained a trade surplus, but the earthquake followed by tsunami in\n2011 turned the country into a net oil importer and created a long period of trade\nimbalances, where oil imports exceeded exports in value. This began to change in\nearly 2015, when a weakening yen and falling oil prices helped to turn around trade\nactivity, returning Japan to a surplus nation. Having a trade surplus means that there\nwill be inherent demand for the Japanese yen even when interest rates are low\nand there are structural deﬁciencies. Japan’s most important trade partners are the\nUnited States and China:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. South Korea\n4. Taiwan\n5.

Saudi Arabia\n■Abenomics\nIn the 1980s, Japan’s capital market was one of the most attractive markets for\ninternational investors seeking investment opportunities in Asia. Japan had the most\ndeveloped capital markets in the region, and its banking system was considered to\nbe the one of the strongest in the world. At the time, the country was experiencing\nabove-trend economic growth and near zero inﬂation. This resulted in rapid\ngrowth expectations, boosted asset prices, and rapid credit expansion, leading to the\ndevelopment of an a sset bubble. Between 1990 and 1997, the asset bubble collapsed,\ninducing a US$10 trillion decline in asset prices, with the fall in real estate values\naccounting for nearly 65% of the total decline, nearly two years of national output.\nThis fall in asset prices sparked the banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early\n1990s and developed into a full-blown systemic crisis in 1997 following the failure\nof a number of high-proﬁle ﬁnancial institutions. Many of these banks and ﬁnancial\ninstitutions extended loans to builders and real estate developers at the height of\nthe asset bubble in the 1980s, with land as collateral. A number of these developers\ndefaulted after the asset bubble collapse, leaving the country’s banks saddled with\nbad debt and collateral worth sometimes 60% to 80% less than when the loans\nwere taken out. Due to the large size of these banking institutions and their role in\ncorporate funding, the crisis had profound effects on Japan and the global economy.\nEnormous bad debts, falling stock prices, and a collapsing real estate sector crippled\nJapan’s economy for more than two decades.\nIt was not until the rollout of Abenomics that the economy began to turn around.\nWhen Shinzo Abe became prime minister for the second time in 2012, he rolled out\na three-pronged plan to stimulate growth and pull the economy out of stagnation\nthrough monetary policy, ﬁscal policy, and economic growth strategies. This was\nknown as Abenomics . In the ﬁrst few weeks of the pr ogram, Abe announced a massive\nstimulus package that involved signiﬁcant government spending and a strong dose\nof quantitative easing. The effects were almost immediate, with the Japanese yen\nfalling signiﬁcantly across the board. Not soon after, the unemployment rate started\nto fall and growth slowly returned.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)241■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers\nMonetary policy in Japan is determined by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). In 1998, the\nJapanese government passed laws giving the BoJ operational independence from the\nMinistry of Finance (MoF) and complete control over monetary policy. However,\ndespite the government’s attempts to decen tralize decision making, the MoF still\nremains in charge of foreign exchange policy. The BoJ is responsible for executing\nall ofﬁcial Japanese foreign exchange transactions at the direction of the MoF. The\nBank of Japan’s Policy Board consists of the BoJ governor, two deputy governors,\nand six other members. Monetary policy meetings are held twice a month, with\nbrieﬁngs and press releases provided immediately. The BoJ also publishes a Monthly\nReport issued by the Policy Board, and a Monthly Economic Report . These reports\nare important to watch for changes in BoJ sentiment and signals of new monetary\nor ﬁscal policy measures, as the government is constantly trying to develop fresh\ninitiatives to stimulate growth.\nThe MoF and the BoJ are very important institutions, and they both can\ninﬂuence currency movements. Since the MoF is the director of foreign exchange\ninterventions, it is important to watch and keep abreast of the comments made\nfrom MoF ofﬁcials. Being an export driven economy, the government tends to favor\na weaker currency. So if the Japanese yen appreciates signiﬁcantly or too rapidly\nagainst the dollar, members of the BoJ and MoF will become increasingly vocal about\ntheir concerns or disapproval in regards to its current level or recent movements.\nThese comments can affect how the yen moves, but if government ofﬁcials ﬂood the\nmarket with comments and there is no follow-up action, the market would start\nto become immune to these concerns. However, the MoF and BoJ have a lengthy\nhistory of interventions in the currency markets to manipulate the value of the yen\nvalue in Japan’s best interests, so their comments cannot be completely ignored.\nThe most popular tool that the BoJ uses to control monetary policy is open\nmarket operations.\nOpen Market Operations\nThese activities are focused on controlling th e uncollateralized overnight call rate.\nThe Bank of Japan has maintained a zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) for some time\nnow, which means that the Bank of Japan cannot lower this rate further to stimulate\ngrowth, consumption, or liquidity. Therefore, in order to maintain zero interest\nrates, the BoJ has to manipulate liquidity through open market operations, targeting\nzero interest on the overnight call rate. It manipulates liquidity by the outright\nbuying or selling of bills, repos, or Japanese government bonds. A repo transaction\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)242involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider (lender), while\nagreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date.\nThis structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the\ncash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities,\nranging from one day to a few weeks.\nImportant Characteristics of the JPY\n■Proxy for Asian strength/weakness . Japan tends to be seen as a proxy for broad Asian\nstrength because the country has the largest GDP in Asia outside of China. With\nthe most developed capital markets, Japan was once the primary destination for\nall investors who wanted access into the region. Japan also conducts a signiﬁcant\namount of trade with its Asian partners. As a result, economic problems or\npolitical instability in Japan tend to spill over into the other Asian countries.\nHowever, this spillover is not one-sided. Economic or political problems in\nother Asian economies, particularly China, can also have dramatic impacts on\nthe Japanese economy and in turn movements in the Japanese yen. For example,\nNorth Korean political instability poses a great risk to Japan and the Japanese yen\ndue to the country’s geographic proximity.\n■Bank of Japan intervention practices . The BoJ and MoF are active participants in\nthe foreign exchange markets. That is, t hey have a lengthy history of entering\nthe FX markets if they are d issatisﬁed with the value of the Japanese yen. While\nthey have not intervened since 2011, they won’t be reluctant to do so if the\ncurrency strengthens signiﬁcantly. As Japan is a very political economy, with\nclose ties between government ofﬁcials and principals of large private institutions,\nthe MoF can have a very narrow segment in mind when it decides to intervene\nin the currency. Since the BoJ is such an active participant, it is very in tune\nwith the market movements and its participants. Periodically, the BoJ receives\ninformation on large hedge fund positions from banks and likes to intervene when\nspeculators are on the other side of the market, allowing them to get the most\n‘‘bang for the bucks.’’ The MoF and BoJ always considers three main factors\nbefore intervention:\n1.Amount of appreciation/depreciation in JPY —Intervention has historically\noccurred when the yen moves by 7 or more yen in less than 6 weeks. Using\nthe USDJPY as a barometer, 7 yen would be equivalent to 700 pips, which\nwould represent a move from 120.00 to 127.00.\n2.Current USDJPY rate —Historically, only 11% of all BoJ interventions that\nwere conducted to counter a strong JPY occurred above the 115 level.\n3.Speculative positions— In order to maximize the impact of intervention, the\nBoJ and MoF prefer to intervene when market participants hold massive\npositions in the opposing direction because the ﬂow of stops will exacerbate\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)243the reversal in the currency pair. The CFTC provides a weekly report on\nexisting speculative positions that can be found at www.cftc.gov.\n■JPY movements are sensitive to time . The Japanese yen can be particularly active\ntowards the end of Japan’s ﬁscal year (March 31), as exporters repatriate their\ndollar denominated assets to window dress their balance sheets. This is particularly\nimportant for Japanese banks because they need to rebuild their balance sheets\nto meet FSA guidelines that require the banks to mark to market their security\nholdings. In anticipation of the need for repatriation-related purchases, Japanese\nyen speculators frequently bid the yen higher in attempt to take advantage of this\nincreased inﬂow. As a result, following ﬁscal year end, the Japanese yen tends to\nhave a bias toward depreciation as speculators close their positions.\nAside from the ﬁscal year end, time is also a factor on a day-to-day basis.\nUnlike traders in London or New York who typically have lunch at their trading\ndesk, Japanese traders tend to take hour-long lunches, leaving only a junior trader\nin the ofﬁce. On occasion, this can translate into additional volatility in the yen\nduring this period as the market becomes illiquid. In addition to this period, the\nJPY tends to move fairly orderly during Japanese and London hours, unless there\nare ofﬁcial comments or major surprises in economic data. During U.S. hours,\nhowever, the JPY tends to have higher volatility, as U.S. traders are actively\nengaging in dollar and yen positions.\n■Stocks and bonds have a positive correlation with USDJPY . The Nikkei has a positive\ncorrelation with USDJPY, which means that when the currency pair appreciating,\nequities are generally on the rise as well. For Japan, the currency typically leads\nequities because a weak yen is positive for the economy, but there can be times\nwhen equities lead currencies. The spread between U.S. 10-year Treasury and\nJGB yields is also very important for the currency. Typically, when the yield\nspread is on the rise, we see USDJPY move higher, and when the yield spread\ndeclines, it creates pressure on USDJPY. Figure 30.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of USDJPY.\n■Carry trade effects . The popularity of carry trades has increased in recent years, as\ninvestors are actively seeking high-yielding assets. With the Japanese yen having\nthe lowest interest rate of all industrialized countries, it is the primary currency\nsold or borrowed in carry trades. The most popular carry trade currencies\nincluded GBPJPY, AUDJPY, NZDJPY, and even USDJPY. Carry traders would\ngo short the Japanese yen against the higher yielding currencies. Unwinding of\ncarry trades as result of spread narrowing is typically beneﬁcial for the Japanese\nyen, as the reversal process involves purchasing the yen and buying back other\ncurrencies. Since there is so much demand to sell the yen for carry, in periods of\nrisk aversion, these trades can be unwound quickly creating a signiﬁcant rally in\nthe currency.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)244■Important Economic Indicators for Japan\nSince Japan is a manufacturing-oriented economy, manufacturing data tend to have\nthe most signiﬁcant impact on the yen. However, on a monthly basis, unless there is\na big surprise, Japanese data do not typically move the currency. The most inﬂuential\nevent risk is always the monetary policy announcement and trade balance. Aside\nfrom that, these are the numbers to watch.\nTankan Survey\nIf there is one piece of Japanese data to follow, it should be the quarterly Tankan\nReport. The Tankan is an economic survey of Japanese enterprises published four\ntimes a year. The survey includes more than 9,000 enterprises, which are divided\ninto four major groups: large, small, and medium-sized companies, as well as\nprincipal enterprises. The survey provides us with an overall impression of the\nbusiness climate in Japan and is widely watched and anticipated by foreign exchange\nmarket participants.\nBalance of Payments\nThe monthly balance of payments report provides investors with insight into Japan’s\ninternational economic transactions that include goods, services, investment income,\nand capital ﬂows. The current account side of BoJ can be used a good gauge of\ninternational trade. Figures are released on a monthly and semiannual basis.\nEmployment\nEmployment ﬁgures are reported on a monthly basis by the Management and\nCoordination Agency of Japan. The employment release measures the number of\njobs and unemployment rate for the country as a whole. The data are obtained\nthrough a statistical survey of the current labor force. This release is a closely\nwatched economic indicator because of its timeliness and its importance as a leading\nindicator of economic activity.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures trends in the output of Japanese\nmanufacturing, mining, and utilities companies. Output refers to the total quantity\nof items produced. The index covers the production of goods for domestic sales\nin Japan and for export. It excludes production in the agriculture, construction,\ntransportation, communication, trade, ﬁnance, and service industries; government\noutput; and imports. The IP index is then developed by weighting each component\naccording to its relative importance during this base period. Investors feel IP and\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)\nk\nk245\nk\nk\nFIGURE 30.1 USDJPY 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)246inventory accumulation have strong correlations with total output and can provide\nvaluable insight into the current state of the economy.\nGDP\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a broad measure of the total production and\nconsumption of goods and services measured over quarterly and yearly periods in\nJapan. GDP is measured by adding total expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. Preliminary reports\nare the most signiﬁcant for FX market participants.\n247CHAPTER 31\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nAustralian Dollar\n(AUD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nAustralia is the twelfth largest country in the world, with a gross domestic product\nof approximately US$1.5 trillion. In Asia, it ranks as the third largest economy\nin the region. On a relative basis, the economy is very small, only one-tenth\nthat of the United States and less than one-ﬁfth the size of China. However on a\nper capita basis, Australia ranks right up there with many industrialized Western\nEuropean countries. Australia has a service-oriented economy with close to 70%\nof GDP coming from industries such as ﬁnance, property, and business services.\nHowever, the country has a trade deﬁcit, with manufacturing dominating the\ncountry’s exporting activities. Rural and mineral exports account for over 60% of all\nmanufacturing exports and 12% of GDP. The economy is therefore highly sensitive\nto changes in commodity prices. As a country heavily dependent on exports, the\npace of growth of Australia’s largest trade partners is extremely important because\ndownturns or rapid growth abroad can impact import and export demand. Here’s a\nbreakdown of Australia’s most important trading partners:\nL a r g e s tE x p o r tM a r k e t s\n1. China\n2. Japan\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)2483. South Korea\n4. United States\n5. New Zealand\nLargest Import Sources\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. Japan\n4. Singapore\n5. Germany\nAs you can see, Australia’s number one trading partner is China. In fact, Chinese\ndemand represents a third of the country’s trade activity. In terms of products, the\nChinese are major importers of Australian iron ore, coal, natural gas, and gold.\nAsia Pac is extremely important to Australia, as more than 70% of its exports are\ndestined for countries within the region. This makes Australia’s economy highly\nsensitive to the performance of countries in the Asian Paciﬁc region. Hiccups in\nChina’s economy can have a signiﬁcant impact on Australia, not only in terms of\nexporting activities but also on housing market activity. At the same time, growth in\nChina is positive for Australia’s economy. During the global ﬁnancial crisis, exports\nto China helped shelter Australia from a major downturn. The relationship between\nChina and Australia is known as Sino-Australian relations. China has recently taken\nsteps to produce its own resources, and if this trend continues, it could dramatically\nchange the landscape of Australia’s economy.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is the central bank of Australia. The monetary\npolicy committee within the central bank consists of the governor (chairman), the\ndeputy governor (vice chairman), secretary to the treasurer, and six independent\nmembers appointed by the government. Changes to monetary policy are made on\nconsensus within the committee.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nThe RBA’s charter states t hat the mandate of the Reserve Bank Board is to focus\nmonetary and banking policy on ensuring:\n1. The stability of the currency of Australia;\n2. The maintenance of full employment in Australia; and\n3. The economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)249In order to achieve these objectives, the government has set an informal consumer\nprice inﬂation target of 2% to 3% per year. The RBA believes that the key to long-\nterm sustainable growth in the economy is to control inﬂation, which would preserve\nthe value of money. In addition, an inﬂation target provides a discipline for monetary\npolicy making and guidelines for private-sector inﬂation expectations. This also\nincreases the transparency of the banks’ activities. Should inﬂation or inﬂation\nexpectations exceed the 2% to 3% target, traders should know that it would raise\nred ﬂags at the RBA and prompt the central bank to favor a tighter monetary policy\nor, in the other words, further rate hikes.\nMonetary policy decisions involve setting the interest rate on overnight loans\nin the money market. Other interest rates in the economy are inﬂuenced by this\ninterest rate to varying degrees, so that the behavior of borrowers and lenders in\nthe ﬁnancial markets is affected by monetary policy (though not only by monetary\npolicy). Through these channels, monetary policy affects the economy in pursuit of\nthe goals just outlined.\nCash Rate\nThe cash rate is the RBA’s target rate for open market operations and is the rate\ncharged on overnight loans between ﬁnancial intermediaries. This means the cash\nrate should have a close relationship with the prevailing money market interest rates.\nChanges in monetary policy directly affect the interest rate structure of the ﬁnancial\nsystem. They also affect sentiment in a currency. Figure 31.1 graphs the AUDUSD\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.01. 2\n1. 1\n1. 0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n6/4/10 6/4/11 6/4/12AUDUSD vs. AU-US 10 Year Spread\n6/4/13 6/4/14 6/4/15\nAU-US Spread AUDUSD\nFIGURE 31.1 AUDUSD vs. 10-Year Yield Spread\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)250against the interest rate differential between Australia and the United States between\n2010 and 2015. There is clearly a positive c orrelation between the 10-year yield\nspread and the currency. Between June 2014 and June 2015, for example, the yield\nspread dropped from 1.5% to 0.5%, and thi s coincided with a drop in the AUDUSD\nfrom 95 to 76 cents.\nMaintaining the Cash Rate: Open Market Operations\nThe focus of daily open market operations is to keep the cash rate close to the target,\nby managing money market liquidity provided to commercial banks. If the Reserve\nBank wishes to decrease the cash rate, it would increase supply of short-dated\nrepurchase agreements at a lower interest rate than the prevailing cash rate, which\nwould in essence decrease the cash rate. If the Reserve Bank wishes to increase\nthe cash rate, it would decrease supply of short-dated repurchase agreements,\nwhich would increase the cash rate. A repurchase agreement involves a cash taker\n(commercial bank) selling securities to a cash provider (RBA), while agreeing to\nrepurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date. This structure\nis similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the cash provider\ninterest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities, ranging from\none day to a few weeks.\nAustralia has had a ﬂoating exchange rate since 1983, and the Reserve Bank\nof Australia may undertake foreign exchange market operations when the market\nthreatens to become excessively volatile or when the exchange rate is clearly\ninconsistent with underlying economic fundamentals. The RBA monitors a trade-\nweighted index (TWI), as well as the cross-rate with the U.S. dollar. Intervention\noperations are invariably aimed at stabilizing market conditions rather than meeting\nexchange rate targets.\nMonetary Policy Meetings\nThe RBA meets every month (except for January), on the ﬁrst Tuesday of each\nmonth, to discuss potential changes in monetary policy. Following each meeting, the\nRBA issues a press release outlining justiﬁcations for its monetary policy changes.\nIf it leaves rates unchanged, no statement is published. The RBA also publishes a\nmonthly Reserve Bank Bulletin . The May and November issues of the Reserve Bank\nBulletin include the semiannual statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy. The\nFebruary, May, August, and November issues contain a Quarterly Report on the\nEconomy and Financial Markets. It is important to read these bulletins for signals on\npotential monetary policy changes.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)251Important Characteristics of the Australian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . Historically, the Australian dollar has had a very strongly\ncorrelation (approximately 80%) with commodity prices and, more speciﬁcally,\ngold and iron ore prices. The correlation stems from the fact that Australia is\nthe world’s second largest gold producer and the world’s largest producer of\niron ore. Therefore, the price of iron ore and gold is extremely important to\nAustralia’s economy. However, unless there is a sharp movement in gold or\niron ore prices, it generally takes time for the AUDUSD to adjust to changes in\nthe price of commodities. Generally speaking, if commodity prices are strong,\ninﬂationary fears start to appear, and the RBA would be inclined to raise rates to\ncurb inﬂation. However, this is a sensitive topic, as gold prices tend to increase\nin times of global economic or political uncertainty. If the RBA increases rates\nduring those conditions, it leaves Australia more vulnerable to spillover effects.\n■Carry trade effects . Australia has one of highest interest rates among the developed\ncountries. With a fairly liquid currency, the Australian dollar is one of the most\npopular currencies to use for carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or\nlending a currency with a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency\nwith a low interest rate. The popularity of the carry trade has contributed to the\n57% rise of the Australian dollar aga inst the U.S. dolla r between 2001 and 2005.\nWhile the carry trade suffered great ly in 2008, it came back strongly between\n2009 and 2011. During this time, many foreign investors were looking for high\nyield when equity investments offered minimal returns. However, carry trades\nonly last as long as the actual yield advantage remains. If global central banks\nincrease their interest rates and the positive interest rate differential between\nAustralia and other countries narro w, the AUDUSD could s uffer from an exodus\nof carry traders.\n■Drought effects . Since the majority of Australia’s exports are commodities, the\ncountry’s GDP is highly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage\nthe country’s farming activities. For example, 2002 was a particularly difﬁcult\nyear for Australia, because the country was experiencing a severe drought. The\ndrought took an extreme toll on Australia’s farming activities, with dry conditions\nhampering the economy throughout the twenty-ﬁrst century. This is important\nbecause agriculture accounts for 3% of the country’s GDP. The RBA estimates\nthat the ‘‘decline in farm production could directly reduce GDP growth by\naround 1 percentage point.’’ Aside from exporting activities, a drought also has\nindirect effects on other aspects of Australia’s economy. Industries that supply and\nservice agriculture, such as the wholesale and transport sectors, as well as retail\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)252operations in rural farming areas, may also be negatively affected by a drought.\nHowever, it is also important to note that the Australian economy has a history\nof recovering strongly after a drought. The 1982–1983 drought ﬁrst subtracted\nthen subsequently added around 1% to 1 1∕2% to GDP growth. The 1991–1995\ndrought reduced GDP by around 1∕2to3∕4percentage points in 1991–1992 and\n1994–1995, but the recovery boosted GDP by 3∕4percentage points.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of Australia\nand the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries should\nalso be closely watched by Australian dollar traders. These differentials can be\ngood indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much premium\nyield Australian dollar short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Australia\nGDP\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services\nin Australia. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Australia ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth generally coincides with a\nweak growth period.\nCPI\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a basket\nof goods and services, which account for a high proportion of expenditure by the\nCPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation, and\nhealth. This is an important indicator to watch, as it is a key input for monetary\npolicy decisions.\nBalance of Goods and Services\nThis number is a monthly measure of Australia’s international trade in goods and\nservices on a balance of payments basis. General merchandise imports and exports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)\nk\nk253\nk\nk\nFIGURE 31.2 AUDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)254are derived mainly from international trade statistics, which are based on Australian\nCustoms Service records. The current account is the balance of trade plus services.\nPrivate Consumption\nThis is a national accounts measure that reﬂects current expenditure by households\nand producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes purchases of\ndurable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure by persons\non the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by unincorporated\nenterprises. This number is important to watch, as private consumption or consumer\nconsumption is the foundation for resilience in the Australian economy.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average\nchanges in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI\ntracks changes in prices for nearly every goods-producing industry in the domestic\neconomy, including agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries,\nmanufacturing, and mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally\nadjusted ﬁnished goods PPI and how the index has reacted on an m/m, q/q, h/h\nand y/y basis. Australia’s PPI data are released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 31.2 illustrates the 10 year performance of AUDUSD.\n255CHAPTER 32\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nNew Zealand Dollar\n(NZD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nNew Zealand is a very small economy with GDP valued at approximately\nUS$183 billion in 2013. In fact, there are less people living in New Zealand\nthan in New York City. It was once one of the most regulated countries within\nthe OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), but over\nthe past two decades the country has been moving toward a more open, modern,\nand stable economy. With the passing of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994, the\ncountry is shifting from an agricultural farming community to one that seeks to\nbecome a leading knowledge-based economy with high skills, high employment,\nand high value-added production. This act sets legal standards that hold the govern-\nment formally responsible to the public for its ﬁscal performance. It also sets the\nframework for the country’s macroeconomic policies. The following are the ﬁve\nprinciples outlined under the Fiscal Responsibility Act:\n1. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; by achieving surpluses on the\noperating budget every year until such a level is reached.\n2. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; and the government must ensure\nthat expenditure is lower than revenue.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)2563. Sufﬁcient levels of Crown net worth must be achieved and maintained to guard\nagainst adverse future events.\n4. Reasonable taxation policies must be followed.\n5. Fiscal risks facing the government must be prudently managed.\nNew Zealand also has highly developed manufacturing and services sectors,\nwith the agricultural industry driving the bulk of the country’s exports. The\neconomy is strongly trade-oriented, with exports of goods and services representing\napproximately one third of GDP. Due to the small size of the economy and its\nsigniﬁcant trade activities, New Zealand is highly sensitive to global performance,\nespecially of its key Asian trading partners, Australia, China, United States, and Japan.\nTogether, Australia, China, and Japan represent 42% of New Zealand’s trading\nactivity. It is also extremely sensitive to exchange rate ﬂuctuations, particularly\nagainst the Australian dollar. The fo llowing lists are a breakdown of the New\nZealand’s most important trading partners:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Australia\n2. China\n3. European Union\n4. United States\n5. Japan\nLeading Import Sources\n1. European Union\n2. China\n3. Australia\n4. United States\n5. Japan\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Reserve\nBank of New Zealand\nMonetary policy in New Zealand is determined by the Reserve Bank (RBNZ).\nThe Monetary Policy Committee is an internal committee of bank executives who\nreview monetary policy on a weekly basis. Meetings to decide on changes to\nmonetary policy occur eight ti mes a year, or approximate ly every six weeks. Unlike\nmost other central banks, the decision for rate changes rests ultimately on the bank’s\ngovernor. The current policy target agreements set by the minister and the governor\nfocus on maintaining policy stability and avoiding unnecessary instability in output,\ninterest rates, and the exchange rate. Price stability refers to maintaining the annual\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)257CPI inﬂation at 1.5%. If the RBNZ does not meet this target, the government has\nthe ability to dismiss the governor of the RBNZ. This is rarely done, but this serves\nas a strong incentive for the RBNZ to meets its inﬂation target. The most common\ntools used by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy changes are the following.\nOfﬁcial Cash Rate (OCR)\nThe Ofﬁcial Cash Rate is the rate set by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy.\nThe Bank lends overnight cash at 25 basis points above the OCR rate and receives\ndeposits or pays interest at 25 basis points below this rate. By controlling the cost\nof liquidity for commercial banks, the RBNZ can inﬂuence the interest rates offered\nto individuals and corporations. This effectively creates a 50 basis point corridor\nthat bounds the interbank overnight rate. The idea is then that banks offering funds\nabove the upper bound will attract few takers, because funds can be borrowed for\na lower cost from the RBNZ. Also, banks offering rates below the lower bound\nwill also attract few takers, because they are offering lower yields than the RBNZ.\nThe ofﬁcial cash rate is reviewed and manipulated with the goal of maintaining\neconomic stability.\nObjectives for Fiscal Policy\nOpen market operations on the other hand are used to meet the cash target. The\ncash target is the targeted amount of reserves held by registered banks. The RBNZ\nprepares forecasts of daily ﬂuctuations on the cash target and will then use these\nforecasts to determine the amount of funds to inject or withdraw in order to meet\nthe cash target. The following government objectives provide a guideline for ﬁscal\nand monetary policy measures:\n■Expenses : Expenses will average around 35% of GDP over the horizon used to\ncalculate contributions toward future New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) costs.\nDuring the buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs, expenses plus contributions\nwill be around 35% of GDP. In the longer term, expenses less withdrawals to\nmeet NZS costs will be around 35% of GDP.\n■Revenue : Raise sufﬁcient revenue to meet the operating balance objective. A\nrobust, broad-based tax system that raises revenue in a fair and efﬁcient way.\n■Operating balance : Operating surplus on average over the economic cycle sufﬁcient\nto meet the requirements for contributions toward future NZS costs and ensure\nconsistency with the debt objective.\n■Debt: Gross debt below 30% of GDP on average over the economic cycle. Net\ndebt, which excludes the assets to meet future NZS costs, below 20% of GDP on\naverage over the economic cycle.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)258■Net worth : Increase net worth consistent with the operating balance objective.\nThis will be achieved through a buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs.\nSource: New Zealand Treasury\n■Important Characteristics of the New Zealand\nDollar\nStrong Correlation with AUD—Competition with Australia\nAustralia is New Zealand’s largest trading partner. This coupled with their geographic\nproximity and New Zealand’s high dependence on trade, creates strong ties between\nthe economies of the two countries. When the Australian economy is healthy and\nAustralian corporations increase their importing activities, New Zealand will be one\nof the ﬁrst to beneﬁt. When it is weak, New Zealand suffers but in recent years\nits sensitivity has diminished because of the country’s growing trade with China\nand other nations. Nonetheless, 22% of trade is still conducted with Australia,\nand this explains why there is a positive correlation between the two currencies.\nFigure 32.1 shows how closely AUDUS D and NZDUSD have moved between 2005\nand 2015.\nCommodity-Linked Currency\nNew Zealand is an export driven economy with commodities representing over\n40% of the country’s exports, and as a result the New Zealand dollar has a strong\ncorrelation with commodity prices, particularly dairy. Fonterra is one of the world’s\n1. 2\n1. 1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.4AUDUSD vs. NZDUSD\n6/30/05 6/30/06 6/30/07 6/30/08 6/30/09 6/30/10 6/30/11 6/30/12 6/30/13 6/30/140.5\nAUDUSD NZDUSD\nFIGURE 32.1 AUDUSD versus NZDUSD\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)259leading dairy producer and also largest company in New Zealand. Twice a month\nthe Global Dairy Trade will conduct an auction and if prices rise, it will be positive\nfor the New Zealand dollar. If prices fall, it will be negative for the currency\nbecause it can mean reduced payout and proﬁt for dairy producers. The correlation\nbetween Australian and New Zealand dollars also contributes to the NZD’s status as a\n‘‘commodity linked’’ currency. Therefore, the New Zealand dollar’s correlation with\ncommodity prices is not only limited to its own trade activities. Therefore, as com-\nmodity prices increase, the Australian economy beneﬁts, translating into increased\nactivity in all aspects of the country’s operations, including trade with New Zealand.\nCarry Trades\nOf the industrialized countries, New Zealand tends to maintain the highest interest\nrate as it needs to offer investors a higher yield to compensate for the risk of\ninvesting in a small economy. This yield advantage along with its secure credit rating\nhas made the New Zealand dollar one of the most popular currencies to purchase\nfor carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. The\npopularity of the carry trade has contributed to the rise of the New Zealand dollar in\nan environment where many global investors are looking for opportunities to earn\nhigh yield. However, this also makes the New Zealand dollar particularly sensitive\nto changes in interest rates. That is, when the United States begins increasing their\ninterest rates, while New Zealand stays on hold or reduces their interest rates, the\ncarry advantage of the New Zealand dollar would narrow. In such situations, the\nNew Zealand dollar could come under pressure as speculators reverse their carry\ntrade positions.\nInterest Rate Differentials\nInterest rate differentials between the cash rates of New Zealand and the short\nterm interest rate yields of other industrialized countries are closely watched by\nprofessional NZD traders. These differentials can be good indicators of potential\nmoney ﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield NZD short-term ﬁxed-\nincome assets are offering over foreign short-term ﬁxed income assets, or vice versa.\nThis differential provides traders with indications of potential currency movements,\nas investors are always looking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly\nimportant to carry traders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive\ninterest rate differentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\nPopulation Migration\nAs mentioned earlier, New Zealand has a very small population, less than half of\nNew York City. Therefore, changes in migration can have signiﬁcant effects on the\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)260economy. Between 2013 an d 2014, the population of New Zealand increased by\n78,800 people, which was the largest net migration in at least 90 years. Between\n2011 and 2012, for example, the population only grew by 26,400 people. Although\nthese absolute numbers appear small, it is fairly signiﬁcant for New Zealand because\nof the size of the population. In fact, this strong population migration into New\nZealand has contributed signiﬁcantly to the performance of the economy, because\nas the population increases, the demand for household goods increases, leading to\nan increase in overall consumer consumption.\nDrought Effects\nSince the bulk of New Zealand’s exports are commodities, the country’s GDP is\nhighly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage the country’s farming\nactivities. In 2013, droughts cost the country over $1.3 billion. In addition, droughts\nare also very frequent in Australia, New Zealand’s largest trading partner, and when\nthey occur it can have a negative impact on the New Zealand economy.\n■Important Economic Indicators for New Zealand\nNew Zealand does not release economic indicators often; however, when they do,\nthe following items are the most important:\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a quarterly measure of the total production and consumption of goods and\nservices in New Zealand. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households,\nbusinesses, government, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used\nto convert output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. This data are\nused to gauge where in the business cycle New Zealand ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often\nis perceived inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nConsumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a\n‘‘basket’’ of goods and services that account for a high proportion of expenditure by\nthe CPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation,\nand health. This is an important indicator to watch, as monetary policy changes are\nhighly inﬂuenced by this index as it is a measure of inﬂation.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)\nk\nk261\nk\nk\nFIGURE 32.2 NZDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)262Balance of Goods and Services\nNew Zealand’s Balance of Payments statements are records of the value of New\nZealand’s transactions in goods, services, income, and transfers with the rest of the\nworld, and the changes in New Zealand’s ﬁnancial claims on (assets), and liabilities\nto, the rest of the world. New Zealand’s International Investment Position statement\nshows, at a particular point in time, the stock of a country’s international ﬁnancial\nassets and international ﬁnancial liabilities.\nRetail Sales Ex Inﬂation\nCredit card spending numbers are released for New Zealand on a monthly basis but\nthe retail sales data is quarterly on an ex inﬂation basis. This measure tracks the\nresale of new and used goods to the public for personal or household consumption.\nIt is also an important input into GDP.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a m/m, q/q, h/h, and y/y basis. New\nZealand’s PPI data is released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 32.2 illustrates the 10-year performance of NZDUSD.\n263CHAPTER 33\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nCanadian Dollar\n(CAD)\n■Broad Economic Performance\nCanada is the world’s eleventh largest country with GDP valued at US$1.8 trillion as\nof 2014. As a resource-based economy, the country’s early economic development\nhinged on the development, exploitation, and exports of natural resources. It is\nnow the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold. However, in actuality,\nnearly two-thirds of the country’s GDP comes from the service sector, which also\nemploys three out of four Canadians. The strength in the service sector is partly\nattributed to the trend by businesses to subcontract a large portion of their services.\nThis may include a manufacturing company subcontracting delivery services to a\ntransportation company. Despite this, manufacturing and resources are still very\nimportant for the Canadian economy, as it represents over 25% of the country’s\nexports and is a primary source of income for a number of provinces.\nThe Canadian economy started to advance with the depreciation of its currency\nagainst the U.S. dollar and the Free Trade Agreement that came into effect in January\n1989. This agreement eliminated almost all trade tariffs between the United States\nand Canada. As a result, Canada now exports over 85% of its goods to the United\nStates. Further negotiations to incorporate Mexico created the North American Free\nTrade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect on January 1994. This more advanced\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)264treaty eliminated most tariffs on trading b etween all three countries. Canada’s close\ntrade relationship with the United States makes it particularly sensitive to the health\nof the U.S. economy. If the U.S. economy sputters, demand for Canadian exports\nwould suffer. The same is true for the opposite scenario; if U.S. economic growth\nis robust, Canadian exports will beneﬁt. In the past decade, trade with China has\nalso increased signiﬁcantly, rising in the ranks from the ﬁfth to the second most\nimportant trade partner for Canada. The following is a breakdown of Canada’s key\nexport and import markets:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. United Kingdom\n4. Japan\n5. Mexico\nLeading Import Sources\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Japan\n4. Mexico\n5. United Kingdom\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Governing Council of the Bank of Canada is the board that is responsible for\nsetting Canadian monetary policy. This council consists of seven members: the\ngovernor and six deputy governors. The Bank of Canada meets approximately eight\ntimes per year to discuss changes in monetary policy. They also release a monthly\nmonetary policy update every quarter, but the rate decision itself is the big market\nmover for the currency.\nCentral Bank Goals\nThe Bank of Canada’s primary focus is on maintaining the ‘‘integrity and value of\nthe currency,’’ and this involves ensuring pri ce stability. Price stability is maintained\nby adhering to an inﬂation target currently set by the Department of Finance at\n1% to 3%. The Bank believes that high inﬂation can damage the functioning of the\neconomy. In their opinion, low inﬂation on the other hand equates to price stability,\nwhich can help to foster sustainable long-term economic growth. The BoC controls\ninﬂation through short-term interest rates. If inﬂation is above the target, the Bank\nwill apply tighter monetary conditions. If it is below the target, the Bank will loosen\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)265monetary policy. Overall, the central bank has done a pretty good job of keeping\nthe inﬂation target within the band since 1998.\nThe Bank measures monetary conditions using its Monetary Conditions Index,\nwhich is a weighted sum of changes in the 90-day commercial paper rate and G-10\ntrade-weighted exchange rates. The weight of the interest rate versus the exchange\nrate is 3 to 1, which is the affect of a chan ge in interest rates on the exchange rate\nbased on historical studies. This means that a 1% increase in short-term interest\nrates is the same as a 3% appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate. To\nchange monetary policy, the BoC manipulates the Bank Rate, which can in turn\naffect the exchange rate. If the currency appreciates to undesirable levels, the BoC\ncan decrease interest rates to offset the rise. If it depreciates, the BoC can raise rates.\nHowever, interest rate changes are not used for the purposes of manipulating the\nexchange rate. Instead, they are used to control inﬂation but an excessively strong\ncurrency and lower inﬂationary pressures can accelerate the changes. The following\nare the most commonly used tools by the BoC to implement monetary policy.\nBank Rate\nThe Bank Rate is the main rate used to control inﬂation. This is the rate of interest\nthat the Bank of Canada charges to commercial banks. Changes to this rate will affect\nother interest rates, including mortgage rates and prime rates charged by commercial\nbanks. Therefore, changes to this rate will ﬁlter into the overall economy.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) is the framework for the Bank of Canada’s\nimplementation of monetary policy. It is through this framework that Canada’s\ncommercial banks borrow and lend overnight money to each other in order to fund\ntheir daily transactions. The LVTS is an electronic platform through which these\nﬁnancial institutions conduct large transactions. The interest rate charged on these\novernight loans is called the overnight rate or bank rate. The BoC can manipulate the\novernight rate by offering to lend at rates lower or higher than the current market\nrate if the overnight lending rate is trading above or below the target banks.\nOn a regular basis, the bank releases a number of publications that are important to\nfollow. This includes a biannual Monetary Policy Report that contains an assessment of\nthe current economic environment and implications for inﬂation and a quarterly Bank\nof Canada Review that includes economic commentary, featured articles, speeches by\nmembers of the Governing Council, and important announcements.\nImportant Characteristics of the Canadian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . As the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold,\nCanada’s economy is highly dependent on commodities. This creates a strong\npositive correlation between the Canadian dollar and oil prices. Generally\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)266speaking, when oil prices rise, it beneﬁts domestic producers and increases their\nincome from exports. However at the same time, strong commodity prices can\nhurt growth abroad; so while rising oil prices are initially positive for Canada,\nthe negative impact on global growth could lead to a decline in demand over the\nmedium term. On the ﬂip side, falling oil prices are negative for the Canadian\ndollar; but if prices remain low and global growth beneﬁts, it can eventually\nneutralize the negative impact.\n■Strong correlation with the United States . Since the 1980s, Canada has been running\nmerchandise trade surpluses with the United States and now approximately 77%\nof Canadian exports are bound for the Untied States. This heavy reliance on U.S.,\ndemand makes Canada extremely sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy. As the\nU.S. economy accelerates, trade increases with Canadian companies, lifting overall\neconomic activity. However, as the U.S. economy slows, the Canadian economy\nwill be hurt signiﬁcantly as U.S. companies reduce their importing activities.\n■Mergers and acquisitions . Due to the proximity of the United States and Canada,\ncross-border mergers and acquisitions are very common, as companies worldwide\nstrive for globalization. These mergers and acquisitions lead to money ﬂowing\nbetween the two countries, which ulti mately impacts the currencies. In 2001,\nthe signiﬁcant U.S. acquisition of Canadian energy companies infused US$25\nbillion into Canada. This led to a strong rally in USDCAD, as the U.S. companies\nneeded to sell USD and buy CAD to pay for their acquisitions. Any similar type\nof M&A ﬂow in the future will also have a signiﬁcant but short-term impact on\nthe Canadian dollar.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of\nCanada and the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries\nare closely watched by professional Canadian dollar traders. These differentials\ncan be good indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much\npremium yield Canadian short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, and vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Carry trades . A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. When\nCanada has a higher interest rate than th e United States, the short USDCAD carry\ntrade becomes more attractive; but if th e United States emba rks on a tightening\ncampaign or Canada lowers rates, the positive interest rate differential between\nthe Canadian dollar and other currencies would narrow. In such situations, the\nCanadian dollar could come under pressure if the speculators begin to exit out of\ntheir carry trades.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)267■Important Economic Indicators for Canada\nCanadian economic reports can have a signiﬁcant impact on the currency. Here are\na handful of the most important releases.\nCanadian Employment\nEvery month, Canada releases its labor market report and this report provides more\ndetails than that of the United States. Job growth is expressed as net job growth and\nthen split into full- and part-time hirers. Generally speaking, the market prefers that\nthe bulk of job growth is full time, because it represents real long-term employment\nand not short-term hires that can be laid off at any time. The unemployment rate is\nalso released, and the number of unemployed persons is expressed as a percentage\nof the labor force.\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\nThe monthly consumer price report measures the average rate of increase in prices.\nWhen economists speak of inﬂation as an economic problem, they generally mean\na persistent increase in the general price level over a period of time, resulting in a\ndecline in a currency’s purchasing power. Inﬂation is often measured as a percentage\nincrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Canada’s inﬂation policy, as set out\nby the federal government and the Bank of Canada, aims to keep inﬂation within\na target range of 1% to 3%. If the rate of inﬂation is 10% a year, $100 worth of\npurchases last year will, on average, cost $110 this year. At the same inﬂation rate,\nthose purchases will cost $121 next year, and so on.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nThe gross domestic product measures the total value of all goods and services\nproduced within Canada during a given year. It is a measure of the income generated\nby production within Canada. GDP is also referred to as economic output. To\navoid counting the same output more than once, GDP includes only ﬁnal goods\nand services—not those that are used to make another product. For example, GDP\nwould not include the wheat used to make bread, but would include the bread itself.\nTrade Balance\nThe balance of trade is a statement of a country’s trade in goods (merchandise) and\nservices. It covers trade in products such as manufactured goods, raw materials, and\nagricultural goods, as well as travel and transportation. The balance of trade is the\ndifference between the value of the goods and services that a country exports and\nthe value of the goods and services that it imports. If a country’s exports exceed its\nimports, it has a trade surplus and the trade balance is said to be positive. If imports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)268\nFIGURE 33.1 USDCAD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nexceed exports, the country has a trade deﬁcit, and its trade balance is said to be\nnegative.\nRetail Sales\nRetail sales is a monthly national accounts measure that calculates current expenditure\nby households and producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes\npurchases of durable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure\nby persons on the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by\nunincorporated enterprises. Stronger consumer spending is positive for Canada’s\neconomy and, in turn, the Canadian dollar, whereas weaker consumer spending is\nnegative for Canada’s economy and currency.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.\nFigure 33.1 illustrates the 10-year

        "213CHAPTER 27\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nEuro (EUR)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe European Union (EU) was developed as an institutional framework for the\nconstruction of a united Europe. As of May 2015, the EU consists of 28 member\ncountries with 19 of these nations sharing the euro as a common currency. The\nEurozone consists of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,\nGreece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,\nPortugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. With the exception of Denmark and the\nUnited Kingdom, other EU states are obliged to join the monetary union when they\nmeet the criteria to do so. Aside from a common currency, these countries also\nshare a single monetary policy dictated by the European Central Bank (ECB). These\ncommon currency countries constitute the European Monetary Union (EMU).\nThe EMU is the world’s second largest economic power, with gross domestic\nproduct valued at approximately US$18 trillion in 2014. With a highly developed\nﬁxed income, equity, and futures market, the EMU is the second most attractive\ninvestment market for domestic and international investors. In its early days, the\nEMU found difﬁculty attracting foreign direct investment or large capital ﬂows\nbecause, historically, the U.S. markets are larger with more consistent returns. As\na result, the U.S. absorbs 71% of total foreign savings. However, with the euro\nbecoming an established currency and the European Monetary Union incorporating\nmore members, the euro’s importance as a reserve currency is rising and translating\ninto greater capital ﬂows. The only problem is that European bond markets are\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)214fragmented, and there are not enough quality assets for central banks to invest in.\nUnless there are euro bonds, foreign central banks could be slow to diversify their\nreserve holdings. Nonetheless, they will do so gradually, providing ongoing support\nfor the euro.\nTrade is extremely important to Eurozone nations and most countries conduct\nthe majority of their trade with other states in the region. This is important because\none of the most valuable aspects of the euro is its facilitation of trade activity through\nthe elimination of exchange rate risk. Large Eurozone nations such as Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Spain also conduct signiﬁcant trade activity with countries like the\nUnited States and China. This makes the value of the euro particularly important\nto economic activity. A country like the United States is less sensitive to exchange\nrate ﬂuctuations because most of its demand is internal, but Europe is extremely\nsensitive to its exchange rate because many Eurozone nations rely on external\ndemand. The size and scope of the EMU’s trade with the rest of the world provides\nit with signiﬁcant power in the international trade arena. International clout is also\none of the primary goals in the formation of the European Union, because it allows\nindividual nations to negotiate as a group on an equal playing ﬁeld with the United\nStates and China, their two largest trading partners. The breakdowns of the most\nimportant trading partners for the European Union are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Switzerland\n4. Russia\n5. Turkey\nLeading Import Sources\n1. China\n2. Russia\n3. United States\n4. Norway\n5. Switzerland\nWhile trade is extremely important, the service sector has the largest share of\ntotal output followed by manufacturing. In fact, a large number of the companies\nwhose primary purpose is to produce ﬁnished products still concentrate their EU\nactivity on innovation, research, design, and marketing, while outsourcing most of\ntheir manufacturing activities to Asia.\nThe EU’s growing role in international trade has major implications for the role of\nthe euro as a reserve currency. As more countries conduct trade with the Eurozone,\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)215they will be motivated to accumulate more euros to reduce exchange risk and\ntransaction costs. Traditionally, most international trade transactions involve the\nBritish pound, the Japanese yen, and/or the U.S. dollar. Before the establishment of\nthe euro, it was unreasonable to hold large amounts of every individual EU national\ncurrency. As a result, currency reserves tended toward the dollar. At the end of the\n1990s, approximately 65% of all world reserves were held in U.S. dollars, but after\nthe introduction of the euro, foreign reserve assets slowly shifted towards the euro.\nThis trend will only continue as the world becomes more globalized.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nMakers—The European Central Bank\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is the governing body responsible for determining\nthe monetary policy of the countries participating in the EMU. The Executive Board\nof the EMU consists of the president of the ECB, the vice president of the ECB, and\nfour other members. These individuals, along with the governors of the national\ncentral banks, comprise the Governing Council. The ECB is set up such that the\nExecutive Board implements the policies dictated by the Governing Council. New\nmonetary policies decisions are typically made by majority vote, with the president\nhaving the casting vote in the event of a tie in their monthly meeting. After each\nmeeting the Central Bank president holds a press conference to answer questions.\nThis is also used as an opportunity to clarify their monetary policy stance.\nThe EMU’s primary objective is to maintain price stability and promote growth.\nMonetary and ﬁscal policy changes are made to ensure that this objective is met. With\nthe formation of the EMU, the Maastric ht Treaty was developed by the Union to\napply a number of criteria for each member country. These criteria were developed\nby the Union to help them achieve their objective. Deviations from these criteria\nby any one country will result in heavy ﬁnes. Listed below are the EMU criteria.\nIt is apparent based on these criteria that the ECB has a strict mandate focused on\ninﬂation and deﬁcit. Generally, the ECB strives to maintain annual growth in HCPI\n(Harmonized Consumer Price Index) below 2% and M3 (Money Supply) annual\ngrowth around 4.5%.\nThe EMU Criteria\nIn the 1992 Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) the following\npreconditions were created for any EU member state looking to join the economic\nand monetary union (EMU).\n■A rate of inﬂation no more than 1.5% above the average of the three best\nperforming member states, taking the average of the 12-month year-on-year rate\npreceding the assessment date.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)216■Long-term interest rates not exceeding the average rates of these low-inﬂation\nstates by more than 2% for the preceding 12 months.\n■Exchange rates which ﬂuctuate within the normal margins of the exchange-rate\nmechanism (ERM) for at least two years.\n■A general government debt/GDP ratio of not more than 60%, although a higher\nratio may be permissible if it is ‘‘sufﬁciently diminishing.’’\n■A general government deﬁcit not exceeding 3% of GDP, although a small and\ntemporary excess can be permitted.\nIf a country meets the convergence criteria and joins the EMU, their monetary\npolicy will be determined by the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB and the\nESCB (European System of Central Banks) are independent institutions from both\nnational governments and other EU institutions, granting them complete control\nover monetary policy. This operational independence is accorded to them as per\nArticle 108 of the Maastricht Treaty, which states that any member of the decision-\nmaking bodies cannot seek or take instructions from any Community Institutions,\nany government of a member state, or any other body. In other words, no one\ncountry can pressure the ECB into making a monetary policy change that is in only\ntheir best interest. The primary tools the ECB uses to control monetary policy is the\nfollowing.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe ECB has four main categories of open market operations to steer interest rates,\nmanage liquidity, and signal monetary policy stance. This includes:\n■Main reﬁnancing operations . These are regular liquidity-providing reverse transac-\ntions conducted weekly with a maturity o f two weeks, which provide the bulk of\nreﬁnancing to the ﬁnancial sector.\n■Longer-term reﬁnancing operations . These are liquidity-providing reverse transactions\nwith a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months, which provide\ncounterparties with additional longer-term reﬁnancing.\n■Fine-tuning operations . These are executed on an ad-hoc basis, with the aim of\nboth managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates, in\nparticular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected\nliquidity ﬂuctuations.\n■Structural operations . These involve the issuance of debt certiﬁcates, reverse trans-\nactions, and outright transactions. These operations will be executed whenever\nthe ECB wishes to adjust th e structural position of the Eurosystem vis-` a-vis the\nﬁnancial sector (on a regular or nonregular basis).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)217ECB Minimum Bid Rate (Repo Rate)\nThe ECB minimum bid rate is the key policy target for the ECB and the level of\nborrowing that the ECB offers to the central banks of its member states. This is also\nthe rate that is subject to change at the monthly ECB meetings. Since inﬂation is a\nmajor concern for European policy makers, they are generally more inclined to keep\ninterest rates at lofty levels to prevent inﬂation. Changes in the ECB’s minimum bid\nrate can have large ramiﬁcations for the EUR.\nThe ECB does not have an exchange rate target, but will factor in exchange rates\nin their policy deliberations because they can affect price stability. A high exchange\nrate lowers inﬂationary pressures while a low exchange rate promotes it. The ECB is\nnot prohibited from intervening in the foreign exchange markets if they believe that\ninﬂation is a concern. As a result, comments by members of the Governing Council\nare closely watched by forex traders and can have a signiﬁcant impact on the euro.\nIn addition to their monthly meetings, the Central Bank will also publish a\nmonthly bulletin and release staff forecasts and minutes from past meetings. The\npresident of the Central Bank holds a press conference after the policy meeting and\nthat, along with each of these event risk s, can cause volatility in the currency.\nNow let’s take a look at some of the important characteristics of the euro:\n■EURUSD cross is the most liquid and actively traded currency . The euro was introduced\nas an electronic currency in January 1999. At the time, the euro replaced all\npre-EMU currencies, except for Greece’s currency, which was converted to the\neuro in January 2001. As a result, the EURUSD cross is now the most liquid\ncurrency in the world and its movements are used as the primary gauge of the\nhealth of both the European and U.S. economies. Figure 27.1 highlights the\n10 year performance of EUR-USD. The euro is most frequently known as the\n‘‘anti-dollar’’ since dollar or U.S. fundamentals generally have a greater impact\non the movement of the currency.\nEURJPY and EURCHF are also very liquid currencies that can be used as a\ngauge of the health of the Japanese and Swiss economies. Many new traders will\nstart with the EURUSD because of its orderly movements, tight spread, and\nliquidity.\n■Euro: A currency without a country . One of the greatest problems of the euro is that it\nis currency without a country. Instead, it bears the economic, political, and social\nrisks of 19 different nations. This is its gr eatest strength and its greatest weakness.\nIn the past decade, we have seen how the debt crisis in smaller Eurozone nations\nhave affected the currency as a whole. It undermines conﬁdence and has, on many\noccasions, put the entire monetary union at risk.\n■Spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and 10-year Bunds can indicate euro sentiment .\nTen-year government bonds can serve as an important indicator of where the euro\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)218\nFIGURE 27.1 EURUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)219is headed, especially against the U.S. dollar. The differential between the 10-year\nU.S. government bond and the 10-year German Bund rates can provide a good\nindication for EURUSD’s movement. If Bund rates are higher than U.S. Treasury\nrates and the differential increases, or the spread widens, this is generally positive\nfor the EURUSD. Alternatively, a decrease in the differential or a tightening of\nthe interest rates is generally bearish for EURUSD. As there is no Euro bond,\nthe 10-year German Bund yield is typically used as the benchmark bond for the\nEurozone because Germany is the largest country in the monetary union.\n■Predictions for euro area money ﬂows . Another useful rate to follow is the three-month\ninterest rate, also known as the euro interbank offer rate or the Euribor rate. This\nis the rate offered from one large bank to another on interbank term deposits.\nTraders tend to compare the Euribor futures rate with the Eurodollar futures rate.\nEurodollars are deposits denominated in U.S. dollars at banks and other ﬁnancial\ninstitutions outside the United States. Because investors like high-yielding assets,\nEuropean ﬁxed-income assets become more attractive as the spread between\nEuribor futures and Eurodollar futures widens in favor of Euribors. As the spread\nnarrows, European assets become less attractive, whereby implying a potential\ndecrease in money ﬂows into the Euro.\nMergers and acquisition activity can also affect how the EURUSD moves.\nIn recent years we have seen increased M&A activity between EU and U.S.\nmultinationals. Large deals, especially with a large cash component, can lead to a\nsudden burst in the EURUSD, but the reaction is generally short-lived.\n■Important Indicators for the Euro\nWhen it comes to Eurozone economic reports, the only ones that affect the euro are\nGerman or Eurozone data. The largest countries in the Eurozone in order of GDP\ncontribution are Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. While French and Italian data\nare important, they rarely move the currency. So what forex traders should focus on\nare the broader regional reports and German data. Central bank rate decisions are\nthe most important, but here are some additional economic reports that can have\nmeaningful impact on the currency.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the Manufacturing\nand Service sectors. For the Eurozone, they provide this data for the four largest\neconomies and a composite index for the region. These numbers are extremely\nmarket moving because they provide the most up-to-date information on how each\nof the economies are performing in the current month and not how the economies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)220performed the previous month like many other reports. However, since the reports\nare for the current period, they are usually subject to revisions so the euro will\nmove on the preliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents\nexpansion, and a reading below 50 represents contraction. For the Eurozone, the\nmanufacturing PMI index is the most important along with the composite index,\nwhich aggregates how the manufacturing and service sector are performing. Since\nthe German data are released shortly before the Eurozone report, they can have a\ngreater impact on the currency.\nIFO Survey\nGermany is by far the largest economy in Europe and is responsible for approximately\n20% of total GDP. Any insight into German business conditions is seen as an insight\ninto Europe as a whole. The IFO is a monthly survey conducted by the IFO institute.\nThey survey over 7,000 German businesses, asking for their assessment of the\nGerman business climate and their short-term plans. The initial publication of the\nresults consists of the business climate headline ﬁgure and its two equally weighted\nsubindices: current business conditions and business expectations. The typical range\nis from 80 to 120, with a higher number indicating greater business conﬁdence. The\nreport is most valuable, however, when measured against previous data.\nInﬂation Indicators—HICP\nSince the ECB has an inﬂation mandate, the EU Harmonized Index of Consumer\nPrices (HICP) published by Eurostat is very important. This harmonized index is\ndesigned for international comparison as required by EU law. The index is compiled\nwith information on prices retrieved by each national statistical agency. Individual\ncountries are required to provide Eurostat with the 100 indices used to compute the\nHICP. The national HICPs are totaled by Eurostat as a weighted average of these\nsubindices, and the weights used are country-speciﬁc. The HICP is released at the\nend of the month following the reference period, which is about 10 days after the\npublications of the national CPIs from Spain and France, the ﬁnal EMU-5 countries\nto release their CPIs. Even if part of the information is already known when the\nHICP is released, it is an important release because it serves as the reference inﬂation\nindex for the ECB who aims to keep Eurozone consumer price inﬂation between\n0% and 2%.\nGerman Industrial Production\nIndustrial production data are seasonally adjusted (SA) and include a breakdown into\nfour major subcategories: mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction. The\nmanufacturing aggregate comprises four main product groups: basic and producer\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)221goods, capital goods, consumer durables, and consumer nondurables. The market\ntends to pay attention to the annual rate of change and the seasonally adjusted\nmonth-on-month ﬁgure. Germany’s ﬁgure is most important since it is the largest\ncountry in the Eurozone; however, the market can also react to the French industrial\nproduction report. The initial industrial production release is based on a narrower\ndata sample and hence subject to revision when the full sample has become available.\nThe ministry occasionally provides insight on the expected direction of the revision\nin the initial data release.\nGerman Unemployment\nLabor market numbers are important for every country and in the case of the\nEurozone, German unemployment is the most important. Released by the Labor\nOfﬁce, the data contain information on the number of unemployed, as well as\nthe changes on the previous month, on both seasonally (SA) and nonseasonally\n(NSA) adjusted terms. The NSA unemployment rate is provided, along with data\non vacancies, short-shift working arrangements, and the number of employees\n(temporarily suspended in 1999). Within an hour after the FLO release, the\nBundesbank releases the SA unemployment rate. The day ahead of the release,\nthere is often a leak of the ofﬁcial data from a trade-union source. The leak is\nusually of the NSA level of unemployment in millions. When a precise ﬁgure is\nreported on Reuters, as given by ‘‘sources’’ for the NSA level of unemployment,\nthe leak usually reﬂects t he ofﬁcial ﬁgures. Rumors often circulate up to one week\nbefore the ofﬁcial release, and they are notoriously imprecise. Regardless, a drop\nin unemployment along with an improvement in the jobless rate is positive for the\ncurrency, whereas a rise in jobless claims or increase in the unemployment rate is\nnegative for the currency.\nPreliminary GDP\nPreliminary GDP is issued when Eurostat has collected data from a sufﬁcient number\nof countries to produce an estimate. This usually includes France, Germany, and\nthe Netherlands. However, Italy is not included in the preliminary release and is\nonly added in the ﬁnal number. The yearly aggregates for EU-15 and EMU-11\nare a simple sum of national GDP. For the quarterly accounts, the aggregation is\nmore complex since some countries (Greece, Ireland, and Luxembourg) do not\nyet produce quarterly national accounts data. Moreover, Portugal produces only\npartial quarterly accounts with a signiﬁcant lag. Thus, both the EU-15 and EMU-11\nquarterly paths are the result of estimates from quarterly data based on a group of\ncountries accounting for more than 95% of total EU GDP (see the Foreword for a\ndetailed description of the weights of each country in the EU).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)222M3\nM3 is a broad measure of money supply, which includes everything from notes\nand coins to bank deposits. The ECB closely monitors M3 as they view it as a key\nmeasure of inﬂation. At its session in December 1998, the governing council of the\nECB set its ﬁrst reference value for M3 growth at 4.5%. This value supports inﬂation\nb e l o w2 % ,t r e n dg r o w t ho f2 %t o2 . 5 % ,a n dal o n g - t e r md e c l i n ei nt h ev e l o c i t y\nof money by 0.5% to 1%. The growth rate is monitored on a three-month moving\naverage basis in order to prevent monthly volatility to distort the information given\nby the aggregate. The ECB’s approach to monetary targeting leaves considerable\nroom for maneuver and interpretation. Because the ECB does not impose bands\non M3 growth, as the Bundesbank used to do, there will be no automatic action\nwhen M3 growth diverges from the reference value. Moreover, although the ECB\nconsiders M3 to be the key indicator, it will also take into account the changes in\nother monetary aggregates.\nIndividual Country Budget Deﬁcits\nThe Stability and Growth Pact states that budget deﬁcits for every country in the\nmonetary union must be kept below 3% of GDP. Failure to meet these targets will\nbe punished. However through the years many Eurozone nations have had deﬁcits\nin excess of 3% and penalties have not been enforced.\n223CHAPTER 28\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nBritish Pound (GBP)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe United Kingdom is the world’s ﬁfth largest economy with GDP valued at\napproximately US$3 trillion in 2014 according to the IMF. With one of the most\ndynamic central banks in the world, the UK economy beneﬁted from many years of\nstrong growth, low unemployment, expa nding output, and resilient consumption.\nThe strength of consumer consumption has been largely due to the strong housing\nmarket. The United Kingdom is a service-oriented economy, with manufacturing\nrepresenting an increasingly smaller portion of GDP, now equivalent to only one-\nﬁfth of national output. Their capital market system is one of the most developed\nin the world, with ﬁnance and banking being the strongest contributors to GDP.\nAlthough the majority of the UK’s GDP is from services, it is also one of the\nlargest producers and exporters of natural gas in the European Union. The energy\nproduction industry accounts for 10% of GDP, which is one of the highest shares of\nany industrialized nation. This is particularly important, as increases in energy prices\n(such as oil) will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt the large number of UK oil exporters. (The\nUnited Kingdom became a net oil importer for a brief period due to disruptions in\nthe North Sea in 2003, but it has already resumed its status as a net oil exporter.)\nOverall, the United Kingdom is a net importer of goods with a consistent\ntrade deﬁcit. Its largest trading partner is the EU, with trade between the two\nconstituencies accounting for over 50% of all of the country’s import and export\nactivities. The United States, on an individual basis, still remains the United\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)224Kingdom’s largest trading partner. The breakdowns of the most important trading\npartners for the United Kingdom are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. Germany\n3. Switzerland\n4. Netherlands\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Netherlands\n3. China\n4. United States\n5. France\nSince the launch of the euro in 1999, the single currency’s troubles have become\nincreasingly apparent, and this has made the UK’s decision to maintain its own\ncurrency and monetary authority increasingly intelligent. Yet the possibility of euro\nadoption will remain a question in the minds of pound traders for many years\nto come, although in 2015 into 2016, the more relevant question is whether the\nUnited Kingdom will remain in the EMU. A decision on euro entry has signiﬁcant\nramiﬁcations for the UK economy—the most important of which is that UK interest\nrates would have to be adjusted to reﬂect the equivalent interest rate of the Eurozone.\nOne of the primary arguments against adopting the euro is that the UK government\nhas sound macroeconomic policies that have worked very well for the country for\ndecades. Its successful monetary and ﬁscal policies have led it to outperform most\nmajor economies during economic downturns, including the European Union.\nThe UK Treasury has previously speciﬁed ﬁve economic tests that must be met\nprior to euro entry, which are the following:\nUK’s Five Economic Tests for Euro\n1. Is there sustainable convergence in business cycles and economic structures\nbetween the United Kingdom and other EMU members, so that the UK citizens\ncould live comfortably with euro interest rates on a permanent basis?\n2. Is there enough ﬂexibility to cope with economic change?\n3. Would joining the EMU create an environment that would encourage ﬁrms to\ninvest in the United Kingdom?\n4. Would joining the EMU have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the\nUK’s ﬁnancial services industry?\n5. Would joining the EMU be good for promoting stability and growth in\nemployment?\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)225The United Kingdom is a very political country where government ofﬁcials are\nhighly concerned with voter approval. If voters do not support euro entry, the\nlikelihood of EMU entry would decline. The following are some of the arguments\nfor and against adopting the euro:\nArguments in Favor of Adopting the Euro\n■There would be reduced exchange rate uncertainty for UK businesses and lower\nexchange rate transa ction costs or risks.\n■The prospect of sustained low inﬂation under the governance of the European\nCentral Bank should reduce long-term interest rates and stimulate sustained\neconomic growth.\n■Single currency promotes price transparency.\n■The integration of national ﬁnancial markets of the EU will lead to higher efﬁciency\nin the allocation of capital in Europe.\n■The euro is the second most important reserve currency after the USD.\n■With the United Kingdom joining the euro, the political clout of the EMU would\nincrease dramatically.\nArguments against Adopting the Euro\n■Currency unions have collapsed in the past.\n■Economic or political instabilities of one country would impact the Euro, which\nwould have exchange rate ramiﬁcations for otherwise healthy countries.\n■Strict EMU criteria outlined by the Stability and Growth Pact.\n■Entry would mean a permanent transfer of domestic monetary authority to the\nEuropean Central Bank.\n■Joining a currency union with no monetary ﬂexibility would require the United\nKingdom to have more ﬂexibility in the labor and housing markets.\n■There are fears about which countries might dominate the ECB.\n■Adjusting to new currency will require large transaction costs.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Bank\nof England\nFor the United Kingdom, the Bank of England (BoE) controls monetary policy, and\nthe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is a nine-member committee responsible\nfor setting interest rate policy in the United Kingdom. It consists of a governor,\ntwo deputy governors, two executive directors of the central bank, and four outside\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)226experts. The committee was granted operational independence in 1997, which\nmeans they won’t be inﬂuenced by the governing party. Despite this independence,\nmonetary policies have centered on achieving an inﬂation target dictated by the\nChancellor of the Treasury. Currently, this target is RPIX (Retail Price Index)\ninﬂation of 2.5%. The central bank has the power to change interest rates to levels\nthat will allow them to meet this target. The MPC holds monthly meetings, which\nare closely followed for announcements on changes in monetary policy, including\nchanges in the interest rate (bank repo rate). When no changes are made, no details\nare provided. In this case, the rate decision is generally a nonevent for the currency,\nwith traders shifting their focus to the minutes released two weeks later.\nThe MPC publishes statements after every meeting, along with a quarterly\nInﬂation Report that details the MPC’s two-year forecast for growth and inﬂation\nalong with justiﬁcation for policy movements. In addition, another publication,\ntheQuarterly Bulletin, provides information on past monetary policy movements\nand analysis of the international economic environment and its impacts on the UK\neconomy. All of these reports can provide guidance of future policy changes. The\nmain policy tools used by the MPC and BoE are the following.\nBank Repo Rate\nThis is the key rate used in monetary policy to meet the Treasury’s inﬂation target.\nThis rate is set for the Bank’s own operati ons in the market, such as its short-term\nlending activities. Changes to this rate affect the rates set by the commercial banks\nfor their savers and borrowers. In turn, this rate will affect spending and output in\nthe economy, and eventually costs and prices. An increase in this rate would imply\nan attempt to curb inﬂation and slow growth, while a decrease in this rate would be\naimed at stimulating growth and expansion.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe goal of open market operations is to implement changes in the bank repo rate,\nwhile assuring adequate liquidity in the market and continued stability in the banking\nsystem. This is reﬂective of the three main objectives of the BoE: maintaining the\nintegrity and value of the currency, maintaining the stability of the ﬁnancial system,\nand seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the United Kingdom’s ﬁnancial services.\nTo ensure liquidity, the Bank conducts daily open market operations to buy or sell\nshort-term government ﬁxed-income instruments. If this is not sufﬁcient to meet\nliquidity needs, the Bank would also conduct additional overnight operations.\nImportant Characteristics of the British Pound\n■GBPUSD is very liquid . The GBPUSD is one of the most liquid currencies in the\nworld, with 6% of all currency trading involving the British pound as either\nthe base or counter currency. It is also one of the three most liquid currencies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)227alongside EURUSD and USDJPY. One of the reasons for the currency’s liquidity\nis the country’s highly developed capital markets. Many foreign investors seeking\nopportunities other than the United States have sent their funds to the United\nKingdom for investment. In order to create these transactions, foreigners will\nneed to sell their local currency and buy British pounds.\n■GBP has three names . The UK’s currency has three names: the British pound,\nsterling, and cable. All of these are used interchangeably.\n■GBP is laden with speculators . At the time of publication, the British pound has one\nof the highest interest rates among the developed nations. Although Australia\nand New Zealand have higher interest rates, their ﬁnancial markets are not as\ndeveloped as that of the United Kingdom. As a result, many investors who already\nhave positions or are interested in initiating new carry trades positions frequently\nuse the GBP as the lending currency and will go long the pound against currencies\nsuch as the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. A carry trade involves\nbuying or lending a currency with a higher interest and selling or borrowing a\ncurrency with a lower interest rate. In recent years, carry trades have increased in\npopularity, which helped spur demand for the British pound. However, should the\ninterest rate yield differential bet ween the pound and other currencies narrow,\nan exodus of carry traders will increase volatility in the British pound.\n■Interest rate differentials between Gilt s and foreign bonds ar e closely followed . Interest rate\ndifferentials between UK Gilts—U.S. Tr easuries and UK Gilts and German Bunds\nare widely watched by FX market participants. Gilts versus Treasuries can be a\nbarometer of GBPUSD ﬂows, while Gilts versus Bunds can be used as a barometer\nfor EURGBP ﬂows. More speciﬁcally, these interest rate differentials indicate how\nmuch premium yield UK ﬁxed-income assets are offering over U.S. and European\n(German Bunds are usually used as a barometer for European yield) ﬁxed-income\nassets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders with indications of potential\ncapital ﬂow or currency movements, as global investors are always shifting their\ncapital in search of the assets with the highest yields. The United Kingdom can\nprovide these yields with the safety of having the same credit stability as the United\nStates.\n■Euro sterling futures can give indications for interest rate movements .S i n c et h eU K\ninterest rate or bank repo rate is the primary tool used in monetary policy, it is\nimportant to keep abreast of potential changes to the interest rate. Comments\nfrom government ofﬁcials is one way to gauge biases for potential rate changes,\nbut the Bank of England is one of the only central banks that requires members\nof the Monetary Policy Committee to publish their speciﬁc voting records.\nThis personal accountability indicates that comments by individual committee\nmembers represent their own opinions and not that of the BoE. Therefore,\nit is necessary to look for other indication of potential BoE rate movements.\nThree-month euro sterling futures reﬂect market expectations on euro sterling\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)228\nFIGURE 28.1 GBPUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\ninterest rates three months into the future. These contracts are also useful in\npredicting UK interest rate changes, which will ultimately affect the ﬂuctuations\nof the GBPUSD. Figure 28.1 illustrates 10 year performance of GBP-USD.\n■Comments on euro by UK politicians will impact the euro . Any speeches, remarks\n(especially from the Prime Minister or Treasury Chancellor), or polls in regards\nto the euro will impact currency trade. Indication of adoption of the euro tends\nto put downward pressure on GBP, while further opposition to euro entry will\ntypically boost the GBP. Reason being that in order for the GBP to come in line\nwith the euro, interest rates would have to decline and monetary policy would\nhave to be subjected to a foreign entity. A decrease in the interest rate would\ninduce carry trade investors to close their positions or sell pounds. The GBPUSD\nwould also decline because of the uncertainties involved with Euro adoption. The\nUK economy is performing very well under the direction of its current monetary\nauthority. The EMU is currently encountering many difﬁculties with member\ncountries breaching EMU criteria. With one monetary authority dictating 19\ncountries (plus UK would be 20), the EMU has yet to prove that they have\ndeveloped a monetary policy suitable for all member states.\n■GBP has positive correlation with energy prices . The UK houses some of the largest\nenergy companies in the world, including British Petroleum. Energy production\nrepresents 10% of GDP. As a result, the British pound tends to have a positive\ncorrelation with energy prices. Speciﬁcally, since many members of the EU\nimport oil from the United Kingdom, as oil prices increase, they will, in turn,\nhave to buy more pounds to fund their energy purchases. In addition, rises in the\nprice of oil will also beneﬁt the earnings of the nations’ energy exporters.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)229■GBP crosses . Although the GBP/USD is a more liquid currency than EURGBP,\nEURGBP is typically the leading gauge for GBP strength. The GBPUSD currency\npair tends to be more sensitive to U.S. developments, while EURGBP is a\nmore pure fundamental pound trade since Europe is Britain’s primary trade\nand investment partner. However, both currencies are naturally interdependent,\nwhich means movements in the EURGBP can affect movements in the GBPUSD.\nThe reverse is also true—that is, movements in GBPUSD will also affect trading\nin EURGBP. Therefore, it is important for pound traders to be consciously aware\nof the trading behavior of both currency pairs. The EURGBP rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURUSD divided by the GBPUSD rate. Small differences in\nthese rates are often exploited by market participants and quickly eliminated.\n■Important Economic Indicators\nfor the United Kingdom\nAll of the following indicators are important for the United Kingdom. However,\nsince the United Kingdom is primarily a service-oriented economy, it is particularly\nimportant to pay attention to service sector data.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the manufacturing,\nservice, and construction sectors. These numbers are extremely market moving\nbecause they provide the most up-to-date information on how each of the economies\nis performing in the current month and not how the economies performed\nthe previous month, like many other reports. However since the reports are for the\ncurrent period, they are usually subject to revisions, so the euro will move on the\npreliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents expansion, and a\nreading below 50 represents contraction. For the United Kingdom, the PMI services\nindex is the most important, along with the composite index, which aggregates how\nthe manufacturing and service sector are performing.\nEmployment Situation\nThe employment report is a monthly survey of the labor market conducted by\nthe Ofﬁce of National Statistics. The obj ectives of the survey are to divide the\nworking-age population into three separate classiﬁcations (employed, unemployed,\nand not in the labor force), and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of\nthese categories. Data from the survey provide market participants with information\non major labor market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors,\nhours worked, labor force participation, and unemployment rates. The timeliness\nof the survey makes it a closely watched s tatistic by the currency market as it is a\ngood barometer of the strength of the UK economy and an important input into\nmonetary policy.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)230Retail Sales\nThe key to growth is consumer spending, and for this reason, the retail sales report\nis also extremely market moving. The Retail Sales Index measures the total goods\nsold by a sampling of retail stores over the course of a month. This index is used as\na gauge of consumer consumption and consumer conﬁdence. While retail sales can\nbe quite volatile due to seasonality, it is one of the most important indicators on the\nhealth of the economy, along with a key input for GDP.\nConsumer or Retail Price Index\nCPI or RPI is a measure of the change in prices of a basket of consumer goods. The\nmarkets however focus on the underlying RPI or RPI-X, which excludes mortgage\ninterest payments. The RPI-X is closely watc hed as the treasury sets inﬂation targets\nfor the BoE, currently deﬁned as 2.5% annual growth in RPI-X.\nGDP\nGDP is a quarterly report conducted by the Bureau of Statistics. GDP is a measure\nof the total production and consumption of goods and services in the UK. GDP\nis measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses, government, and\nnet foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert output measured\nat current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used to gauge where in\nthe business cycle the United Kingdom ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is perceived\nas inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or weak\ngrowth.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures the change in output in the United\nKingdom of manufacturing; mining and quarrying; and electricity, gas, and water\nsupply. Output refers to the physical quantity of items produced, unlike sales value,\nwhich combines quantity and price. The index covers the production of goods and\npower for domestic sales in the United Kingdom and for export. Because IP is\nresponsible for close to a quarter of gross domestic product, IP is widely watched as\nit can provide good insight into the current state of the economy.\nUK Housing Starts\nHousing starts measures the number of residential building construction projects\nthat have begun during any particular month. This is important for the United\nKingdom as the housing market is the primary industry that sustains the economy.\n231CHAPTER 29\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nSwiss Franc (CHF)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nSwitzerland is the twentieth largest economy in the world, with a GDP valued at\nover US$685 billion as of 2014. Although the economy is relatively small, it is one of\nthe wealthiest in the world on a GDP per capita basis. The country is prosperous and\ntechnologically advanced with economic and political stability that rivals many larger\neconomies. The country’s prosperity stems primarily from technological expertise\nin manufacturing, tourism, and banking. More speciﬁcally, Switzerland is known for\ntheir chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, machinery, precision instruments,\nwatches, and a ﬁnancial system historically known for protecting the conﬁdentiality\nof its investors. This coupled with the country’s lengthy history of political neutrality\nearned Switzerland the Swiss franc safe haven status and as a direct result of that,\nit is the one world’s most popular destinations for offshore capital. Even when the\ncentral bank introduced a temporary 1.20 EURCHF peg and lowered interest rates\nto negative levels, Switzerland stil l managed to attract safe haven ﬂows.\nIt is estimated that Switzerland holds over US$2 trillion in offshore assets as of\n2014 and attracts over 35% of the world’s private wealth management business.\nA large and highly advanced banking and insurance industry has developed to support\nthis demand, and the sector employs over 50% of the population and comprises over\n70% of total GDP. Since Switzerland’s ﬁnancial industry thrives on its safe haven\nstatus and renowned conﬁdentiality, capital ﬂows tend to drive the economy during\ntimes of global risk aversion, while trade ﬂows drive the economy in a risk-seeking\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)232environment. Trade ﬂows are extremely important, with nearly two thirds of all\ntrade conducted with Europe. With this in mind, Switzerland’s most important\ntrading partners a re the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Germany\n2. India\n3. United States\n4. Hong Kong\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Italy\n3. United States\n4. France\n5. China\nTraditionally, Switzerland has a strong trade and current account surplus that\nlends support to the currency. Most of the surplus can be attributed to the large\namount of foreign direct investment into the country, in seek of safety of capital,\ndespite the low to negative yields offered by Switzerland.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Swiss\nNational Bank\nMonetary policy in Switzerland is determined by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). They\nare a completely independent authority with a three-person committee responsible\nfor determining monetary policy. This committee consists of a chairman, a vice\nchairman, and one other (member) who constitute the Governing Board of the\nSNB. Due to the small size of the committee, all decisions are based on a consensus\nvote. The Board reviews monetary policy at least once a quarter, but decisions on\nmonetary policy can be made and announced at any point in time. Unlike most other\ncentral banks, the SNB does not set one ofﬁcial interest rate target, but instead sets\na target range for their three-month Swiss Libor rate.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nIn December of 1999, the SNB shifted from focusing on monetary targets (M3) to an\ninﬂation target of less than 2% inﬂation per year. This measure is taken based on the\nnational consumer price index. Monetary targets still remain important indicators\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)233and are closely watched by the central bank, because they provide information on\nthe long-term inﬂation. This new inﬂation focus also increases the central bank’s\ntransparency. In their mandate, they have clearly stated, ‘‘Should inﬂation exceed\n2% in the medium term, the National Bank will tend to tighten its monetary stance.’’\nIf there is danger of deﬂation, the National Bank would loosen monetary policy. The\nSNB also closely monitors exchange rates, as excessive strength in the Swiss franc\ncan cause inﬂationary conditions. This is especially true in environments of global\nrisk aversion, as capital ﬂows into Switzerland increases signiﬁcantly during those\ntimes. As a result, the SNB typically favors a weak franc, and is not hesitant to use\nintervention as liquidity tool. SNB ofﬁcials intervene in the franc using a variety of\nmethods including verbal remarks on liquidity, money supply, and the currency.\nTheir Tools\nThe most commonly used tools by the SNB to implement monetary policy include\nthe following.\nTarget Interest Rate Range\nTraditionally, the SNB implements monetary policy by setting a target range for\ntheir three-month interest rate known as the Swiss Franc Libor rate. According\nto the SNB, ‘‘The Libor is a reference inte rest rate in the interbank market for\nunsecured loans.’’ It is a trimmed mean of the rates charged by 12 leading banks and\nis published daily by the British Bankers’ Association. The National Bank publishes\nits target range regularly. As a rule, this range extends over 1 percentage point,\nand the SNB generally aims to keep the Libor in the middle of the range. The SNB\nundertakes quarterly economic and monetary assessments at which it reviews its\nmonetary policy. If circumstances so require, it will also adjust the Libor target\nrange in between these quarterly assessments. It sets out the reasons for its decisions\nin press releases.\nOpen Market Operations\nRepo transactions are the SNB’s major monetary policy instrument. A repo\ntransaction involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider\n(lender), while agreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity\nat a later date. This structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker\nmust pay the cash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short\nmaturities ranging from one day to a few weeks. The SNB uses these repo transactions\nto manipulate undesirable moves in the three-month Libor rate. To prevent increases\nin the three-month Libor rate above the SNB’s target, the bank would supply the\ncommercial banks with additional liquidity through repo transactions at lower repo\nrates, and in essence create additional liquidity. Conversely, the SNB can reduce\nliquidity or induce increases in the three-month Libor rate by increasing repo rates.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)234In addition to the quarterly monetary policy decision, the SNB publishes a\nQuarterly Bulletin with a detailed assessment of the current state of the economy\nand a review of monetary policy. A Monthly Bulletin is also published containing a\nshort review of economic developments. These reports are important to watch, as\nthey may contain information on changes in the SNB’s assessment of economy and\nguidance on monetary policy.\n1.20 EUR/CHF Peg Implementation and Abandonment\nFew would have expected that one of the seminal developments in the forex market\nwas the Swiss National Bank’s decision to implement and later abandon its 1.20\nEURCHF peg. This decision transformed the foreign exchange industry, bankrupted\nmany brokers, and led to tighter regulations across the globe. Faced with a high level\nof uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued currency and deﬂation risks\nin 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At\nthe time, it pledged to sell francs in an unlimited quantity to maintain the peg. The\ngoal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping the gain in the franc. However,\nin January 2015, the prospect of quantitative easing from the European Central\nBank pushed the SNB to abandon the peg. It also accumulated signiﬁcant foreign\nexchange reserves that irritated critics, but more importantly, the franc became less\novervalued through the years, giving the SNB fewer reasons to maintain the peg.\nSNB’s decision was a complete surprise, and caused a 30% drop in EURCHF in\na single day. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\n■Important Characteristics of the Swiss Franc\n■Safe haven status . This is perhaps the most unique characteristic of the Swiss franc.\nSwitzerland’s safe haven status is continually stressed because this and the secrecy\nof the banking system are the key advantages of Switzerland. The Swiss franc\nmoves primarily on external events rather than domestic economic conditions.\nThat is, as mentioned earlier, due to its political neutrality, the franc is considered\nthe world’s premier safe haven currency. Therefore, in times of global instability\nand/or uncertainty, investors tend to be more concerned with capital retention\nthan appreciation. At such times, funds will ﬂow into Switzerland, which would\ncause the Swiss franc to appreciate regardless of whether growth conditions are\nfavorable.\n■Swiss franc is closely correlated with gold . Switzerland is the world’s third largest\nofﬁcial holder of gold. In the past, a Swiss constitutional mandate required the\ncurrency to be backed 40% with gold reserves. The mandate is now removed\nbut the positive correlation between the Swiss franc and gold remains because\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)235the relationship has been engrained into the minds of forex traders; therefore,\nboth gold and the Swiss franc are perceived as safe haven instruments. Before the\nSNB abandoned the EURCHF 1.20, Swiss franc had an 80% positive correlation\nwith gold. These days, the correlation is still there but in a smaller magnitude.\nGenerally speaking, if the price of gold appreciates, the Swiss franc has a high\nlikelihood of rising in value. In addition, since gold is also viewed as the ultimate\nsafe haven form of money, both gold and the Swiss franc beneﬁt during periods\nof global economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n■Carry trades effects . With one of the lowest interest rates in the industrialized world,\nover the past few years, the Swiss franc has become one of the most popular\nfunding currencies for carry trades. As mentioned in this book, the popularity of\ncarry trades has increased signiﬁcantly over the past two decades, as investors are\nactively seeking high yield. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency\nwith a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest\nrate. With CHF having one of the lowest interest rates of all industrialized\ncountries, it is one of the primary currencies sold or borrowed in carry trades.\nThis results in the need to sell CHF against a higher yielding currency. Carry\ntrades are typically done in cross-currencies such as GBPCHF or AUDCHF, but\nthese trades can impact both EURCHF and USDCHF. The unwinding of carry\ntrades involves the need for investors to buy back the Swiss franc.\n■Interest rate differentials between euro Swiss futures and foreign interest rate futures are\nclosely followed . One of the favorite indicators of professional Swiss franc traders\nis the interest rate differential bet ween three-month euro Swiss futures and\neurodollar futures. These differentials can provide guidance on potential money\nﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield U.S. ﬁxed-income assets are\noffering over Swiss ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides\ntraders with indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always\nlooking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry\ntraders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate\ndifferentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Potential changes in banking regulations . Over the past few years members of the\nEuropean Union have been exerting signiﬁcant pressure on Switzerland to relax\nthe conﬁdentiality of their banking system and to increase transparency of their\ncustomers’ accounts. The European Union is pressing this issue because of its\nactive measures to persecute EU tax evaders. This should be a concern for many\nyears to come. However, this is a difﬁcult decision for Switzerland to make because\nthe conﬁdentiality of their customers’ accounts represents the core strength of\ntheir banking system. The EU has threatened to impose severe sanctions on\nSwitzerland if they do not comply with their proposed measures. Both countries\nare currently working to negotiate an equitable resolution. Any news or talk of\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)236changing banking regulations will impact both Switzerland’s economy and the\nSwiss franc.\n■Mergers and acquisition activity . Switzerland’s primary industry is banking and\nﬁnance. In this industry, merger and acquisition activities (M&A) are very\ncommon, especially as consolidation continues in the overall industry. As a result,\nthese M&A activities can have signiﬁcant impact on the Swiss franc. If foreign\nﬁrms purchase Swiss banks or insurance companies, they will need to buy Swiss\nfrancs and in turn, sell their local currency. If Swiss banks purchase foreign ﬁrms,\nthey would need to sell Swiss francs and buy the foreign currency. Either way,\nit is important for Swiss franc traders to frequently watch for notices on M&A\nactivity involving Swiss ﬁrms.\n■Trading behavior, cross currency characteristics . The EURCHF is the most commonly\ntraded currency for traders who want to participate in CHF movements. USDCHF\nis less frequently traded because of its greater illiquidity and volatility. However,\nday traders may tend to favor USDCHF over EURCHF because of its volatile\nmovements. In actuality, the USDCHF is a synthetic currency derived from\nEURUSD and EURCHF because more tra nsactions are done between the euro\nand Swiss franc. Market makers or professional traders tend to use those pairs as\nleading indicators for trading USDCHF or to price the current USDCHF level\nwhen the currency pair is illiquid. Theoretically, the USDCHF rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURCHF rate divided by EURUSD. Only during times of\nunusual circumstances, such as the Iraq War, September 11, or the EURCHF peg,\nwill USDCHF develop a market of its own. Any small differences in these rates\nare quickly exploited by market participants. Figure 29.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of EUR-CHF.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Switzerland\nEconomic data from Switzerland tends to have limited impact on the currency, but\nthese are the most important pieces of Swiss data.\nKoF Leading Indicators\nThe KoF leading indicators report is released by the Swiss Institute for Business\nCycle Research. This index is generally used to gauge the future health of the\nSwiss economy. It contains six components: (1) change in manufacturers’ orders;\n(2) the expected purchase plans of manufacturers over the next three months; (3)\nthe judgment of stocks in wholesale business; (4) consumer perception of their\nﬁnancial conditions; (5) backlog in the construction sector; and (6) orders backlog\nfor manufacturers.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)\nk\nk237\nk\nk\nFIGURE 29.1 EURCHF 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)238Consumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index is calculated monthly, on the basis of retail prices paid in\nSwitzerland. In accordance with prevalent international practice, the commodities\ncovered are distinguished according to the consumption concept, which includes in\nthe calculation of the CPI of those goods and services that are part of the private\nconsumption aggregate according to the National Accounts. The basket of goods does\nnot include transfer expenditure such as direct taxation, social insurance contributions,\nand health insurance premiums. The index is a key measure of inﬂation.\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services in\nthe Switzerland. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Switzerland ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nBalance of Payments\nBalance of payments is the collective term for the accounts of Swiss transactions\nwith the rest of the world. The current account is the balance of trade plus services\nportion. BoP is an important indicator for Swiss traders, as Switzerland has always\nkept a strong current account balance. Any changes to the current account, positive\nor negative, could see substantial ﬂows.\nProduction Index (Industrial Production)\nThe production index is a quarterly measure of the change in the volume of industrial\nproduction (or physical output by producers).\nRetail Sales\nSwitzerland’s retail sales report is released on a monthly basis 40 days after the\nreference month. The report is an important indicator of consumer spending habits\nand is not seasonally adjusted.\n239CHAPTER 30\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nJapanese Yen (JPY)\n■Economic Overview\nJapan is the third largest economy in the world with GDP valued at over US$4.6\ntrillion in 2014 (behind the United States and China). If we count the European\nUnion as a whole, it would be considered the fourth largest economy. Japan is one of\nthe world’s largest exporters and is responsible for over US$690 billion in exports\nper year. Manufacturing and exports of products such as electronics and cars are the\nsignature drivers of the economy, accounting for nearly 17% of GDP. As a result,\nJapanese growth is extremely sensitive to the value of the currency. For many years,\nJapan has maintained a trade surplus, but the earthquake followed by tsunami in\n2011 turned the country into a net oil importer and created a long period of trade\nimbalances, where oil imports exceeded exports in value. This began to change in\nearly 2015, when a weakening yen and falling oil prices helped to turn around trade\nactivity, returning Japan to a surplus nation. Having a trade surplus means that there\nwill be inherent demand for the Japanese yen even when interest rates are low\nand there are structural deﬁciencies. Japan’s most important trade partners are the\nUnited States and China:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. South Korea\n4. Taiwan\n5. Hong Kong\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)240Leading Import Sources:\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. South Korea\n4. Australia\n5. Saudi Arabia\n■Abenomics\nIn the 1980s, Japan’s capital market was one of the most attractive markets for\ninternational investors seeking investment opportunities in Asia. Japan had the most\ndeveloped capital markets in the region, and its banking system was considered to\nbe the one of the strongest in the world. At the time, the country was experiencing\nabove-trend economic growth and near zero inﬂation. This resulted in rapid\ngrowth expectations, boosted asset prices, and rapid credit expansion, leading to the\ndevelopment of an a sset bubble. Between 1990 and 1997, the asset bubble collapsed,\ninducing a US$10 trillion decline in asset prices, with the fall in real estate values\naccounting for nearly 65% of the total decline, nearly two years of national output.\nThis fall in asset prices sparked the banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early\n1990s and developed into a full-blown systemic crisis in 1997 following the failure\nof a number of high-proﬁle ﬁnancial institutions. Many of these banks and ﬁnancial\ninstitutions extended loans to builders and real estate developers at the height of\nthe asset bubble in the 1980s, with land as collateral. A number of these developers\ndefaulted after the asset bubble collapse, leaving the country’s banks saddled with\nbad debt and collateral worth sometimes 60% to 80% less than when the loans\nwere taken out. Due to the large size of these banking institutions and their role in\ncorporate funding, the crisis had profound effects on Japan and the global economy.\nEnormous bad debts, falling stock prices, and a collapsing real estate sector crippled\nJapan’s economy for more than two decades.\nIt was not until the rollout of Abenomics that the economy began to turn around.\nWhen Shinzo Abe became prime minister for the second time in 2012, he rolled out\na three-pronged plan to stimulate growth and pull the economy out of stagnation\nthrough monetary policy, ﬁscal policy, and economic growth strategies. This was\nknown as Abenomics . In the ﬁrst few weeks of the pr ogram, Abe announced a massive\nstimulus package that involved signiﬁcant government spending and a strong dose\nof quantitative easing. The effects were almost immediate, with the Japanese yen\nfalling signiﬁcantly across the board. Not soon after, the unemployment rate started\nto fall and growth slowly returned.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)241■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers\nMonetary policy in Japan is determined by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). In 1998, the\nJapanese government passed laws giving the BoJ operational independence from the\nMinistry of Finance (MoF) and complete control over monetary policy. However,\ndespite the government’s attempts to decen tralize decision making, the MoF still\nremains in charge of foreign exchange policy. The BoJ is responsible for executing\nall ofﬁcial Japanese foreign exchange transactions at the direction of the MoF. The\nBank of Japan’s Policy Board consists of the BoJ governor, two deputy governors,\nand six other members. Monetary policy meetings are held twice a month, with\nbrieﬁngs and press releases provided immediately. The BoJ also publishes a Monthly\nReport issued by the Policy Board, and a Monthly Economic Report . These reports\nare important to watch for changes in BoJ sentiment and signals of new monetary\nor ﬁscal policy measures, as the government is constantly trying to develop fresh\ninitiatives to stimulate growth.\nThe MoF and the BoJ are very important institutions, and they both can\ninﬂuence currency movements. Since the MoF is the director of foreign exchange\ninterventions, it is important to watch and keep abreast of the comments made\nfrom MoF ofﬁcials. Being an export driven economy, the government tends to favor\na weaker currency. So if the Japanese yen appreciates signiﬁcantly or too rapidly\nagainst the dollar, members of the BoJ and MoF will become increasingly vocal about\ntheir concerns or disapproval in regards to its current level or recent movements.\nThese comments can affect how the yen moves, but if government ofﬁcials ﬂood the\nmarket with comments and there is no follow-up action, the market would start\nto become immune to these concerns. However, the MoF and BoJ have a lengthy\nhistory of interventions in the currency markets to manipulate the value of the yen\nvalue in Japan’s best interests, so their comments cannot be completely ignored.\nThe most popular tool that the BoJ uses to control monetary policy is open\nmarket operations.\nOpen Market Operations\nThese activities are focused on controlling th e uncollateralized overnight call rate.\nThe Bank of Japan has maintained a zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) for some time\nnow, which means that the Bank of Japan cannot lower this rate further to stimulate\ngrowth, consumption, or liquidity. Therefore, in order to maintain zero interest\nrates, the BoJ has to manipulate liquidity through open market operations, targeting\nzero interest on the overnight call rate. It manipulates liquidity by the outright\nbuying or selling of bills, repos, or Japanese government bonds. A repo transaction\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)242involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider (lender), while\nagreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date.\nThis structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the\ncash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities,\nranging from one day to a few weeks.\nImportant Characteristics of the JPY\n■Proxy for Asian strength/weakness . Japan tends to be seen as a proxy for broad Asian\nstrength because the country has the largest GDP in Asia outside of China. With\nthe most developed capital markets, Japan was once the primary destination for\nall investors who wanted access into the region. Japan also conducts a signiﬁcant\namount of trade with its Asian partners. As a result, economic problems or\npolitical instability in Japan tend to spill over into the other Asian countries.\nHowever, this spillover is not one-sided. Economic or political problems in\nother Asian economies, particularly China, can also have dramatic impacts on\nthe Japanese economy and in turn movements in the Japanese yen. For example,\nNorth Korean political instability poses a great risk to Japan and the Japanese yen\ndue to the country’s geographic proximity.\n■Bank of Japan intervention practices . The BoJ and MoF are active participants in\nthe foreign exchange markets. That is, t hey have a lengthy history of entering\nthe FX markets if they are d issatisﬁed with the value of the Japanese yen. While\nthey have not intervened since 2011, they won’t be reluctant to do so if the\ncurrency strengthens signiﬁcantly. As Japan is a very political economy, with\nclose ties between government ofﬁcials and principals of large private institutions,\nthe MoF can have a very narrow segment in mind when it decides to intervene\nin the currency. Since the BoJ is such an active participant, it is very in tune\nwith the market movements and its participants. Periodically, the BoJ receives\ninformation on large hedge fund positions from banks and likes to intervene when\nspeculators are on the other side of the market, allowing them to get the most\n‘‘bang for the bucks.’’ The MoF and BoJ always considers three main factors\nbefore intervention:\n1.Amount of appreciation/depreciation in JPY —Intervention has historically\noccurred when the yen moves by 7 or more yen in less than 6 weeks. Using\nthe USDJPY as a barometer, 7 yen would be equivalent to 700 pips, which\nwould represent a move from 120.00 to 127.00.\n2.Current USDJPY rate —Historically, only 11% of all BoJ interventions that\nwere conducted to counter a strong JPY occurred above the 115 level.\n3.Speculative positions— In order to maximize the impact of intervention, the\nBoJ and MoF prefer to intervene when market participants hold massive\npositions in the opposing direction because the ﬂow of stops will exacerbate\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)243the reversal in the currency pair. The CFTC provides a weekly report on\nexisting speculative positions that can be found at www.cftc.gov.\n■JPY movements are sensitive to time . The Japanese yen can be particularly active\ntowards the end of Japan’s ﬁscal year (March 31), as exporters repatriate their\ndollar denominated assets to window dress their balance sheets. This is particularly\nimportant for Japanese banks because they need to rebuild their balance sheets\nto meet FSA guidelines that require the banks to mark to market their security\nholdings. In anticipation of the need for repatriation-related purchases, Japanese\nyen speculators frequently bid the yen higher in attempt to take advantage of this\nincreased inﬂow. As a result, following ﬁscal year end, the Japanese yen tends to\nhave a bias toward depreciation as speculators close their positions.\nAside from the ﬁscal year end, time is also a factor on a day-to-day basis.\nUnlike traders in London or New York who typically have lunch at their trading\ndesk, Japanese traders tend to take hour-long lunches, leaving only a junior trader\nin the ofﬁce. On occasion, this can translate into additional volatility in the yen\nduring this period as the market becomes illiquid. In addition to this period, the\nJPY tends to move fairly orderly during Japanese and London hours, unless there\nare ofﬁcial comments or major surprises in economic data. During U.S. hours,\nhowever, the JPY tends to have higher volatility, as U.S. traders are actively\nengaging in dollar and yen positions.\n■Stocks and bonds have a positive correlation with USDJPY . The Nikkei has a positive\ncorrelation with USDJPY, which means that when the currency pair appreciating,\nequities are generally on the rise as well. For Japan, the currency typically leads\nequities because a weak yen is positive for the economy, but there can be times\nwhen equities lead currencies. The spread between U.S. 10-year Treasury and\nJGB yields is also very important for the currency. Typically, when the yield\nspread is on the rise, we see USDJPY move higher, and when the yield spread\ndeclines, it creates pressure on USDJPY. Figure 30.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of USDJPY.\n■Carry trade effects . The popularity of carry trades has increased in recent years, as\ninvestors are actively seeking high-yielding assets. With the Japanese yen having\nthe lowest interest rate of all industrialized countries, it is the primary currency\nsold or borrowed in carry trades. The most popular carry trade currencies\nincluded GBPJPY, AUDJPY, NZDJPY, and even USDJPY. Carry traders would\ngo short the Japanese yen against the higher yielding currencies. Unwinding of\ncarry trades as result of spread narrowing is typically beneﬁcial for the Japanese\nyen, as the reversal process involves purchasing the yen and buying back other\ncurrencies. Since there is so much demand to sell the yen for carry, in periods of\nrisk aversion, these trades can be unwound quickly creating a signiﬁcant rally in\nthe currency.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)244■Important Economic Indicators for Japan\nSince Japan is a manufacturing-oriented economy, manufacturing data tend to have\nthe most signiﬁcant impact on the yen. However, on a monthly basis, unless there is\na big surprise, Japanese data do not typically move the currency. The most inﬂuential\nevent risk is always the monetary policy announcement and trade balance. Aside\nfrom that, these are the numbers to watch.\nTankan Survey\nIf there is one piece of Japanese data to follow, it should be the quarterly Tankan\nReport. The Tankan is an economic survey of Japanese enterprises published four\ntimes a year. The survey includes more than 9,000 enterprises, which are divided\ninto four major groups: large, small, and medium-sized companies, as well as\nprincipal enterprises. The survey provides us with an overall impression of the\nbusiness climate in Japan and is widely watched and anticipated by foreign exchange\nmarket participants.\nBalance of Payments\nThe monthly balance of payments report provides investors with insight into Japan’s\ninternational economic transactions that include goods, services, investment income,\nand capital ﬂows. The current account side of BoJ can be used a good gauge of\ninternational trade. Figures are released on a monthly and semiannual basis.\nEmployment\nEmployment ﬁgures are reported on a monthly basis by the Management and\nCoordination Agency of Japan. The employment release measures the number of\njobs and unemployment rate for the country as a whole. The data are obtained\nthrough a statistical survey of the current labor force. This release is a closely\nwatched economic indicator because of its timeliness and its importance as a leading\nindicator of economic activity.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures trends in the output of Japanese\nmanufacturing, mining, and utilities companies. Output refers to the total quantity\nof items produced. The index covers the production of goods for domestic sales\nin Japan and for export. It excludes production in the agriculture, construction,\ntransportation, communication, trade, ﬁnance, and service industries; government\noutput; and imports. The IP index is then developed by weighting each component\naccording to its relative importance during this base period. Investors feel IP and\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)\nk\nk245\nk\nk\nFIGURE 30.1 USDJPY 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)246inventory accumulation have strong correlations with total output and can provide\nvaluable insight into the current state of the economy.\nGDP\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a broad measure of the total production and\nconsumption of goods and services measured over quarterly and yearly periods in\nJapan. GDP is measured by adding total expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. Preliminary reports\nare the most signiﬁcant for FX market participants.\n247CHAPTER 31\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nAustralian Dollar\n(AUD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nAustralia is the twelfth largest country in the world, with a gross domestic product\nof approximately US$1.5 trillion. In Asia, it ranks as the third largest economy\nin the region. On a relative basis, the economy is very small, only one-tenth\nthat of the United States and less than one-ﬁfth the size of China. However on a\nper capita basis, Australia ranks right up there with many industrialized Western\nEuropean countries. Australia has a service-oriented economy with close to 70%\nof GDP coming from industries such as ﬁnance, property, and business services.\nHowever, the country has a trade deﬁcit, with manufacturing dominating the\ncountry’s exporting activities. Rural and mineral exports account for over 60% of all\nmanufacturing exports and 12% of GDP. The economy is therefore highly sensitive\nto changes in commodity prices. As a country heavily dependent on exports, the\npace of growth of Australia’s largest trade partners is extremely important because\ndownturns or rapid growth abroad can impact import and export demand. Here’s a\nbreakdown of Australia’s most important trading partners:\nL a r g e s tE x p o r tM a r k e t s\n1. China\n2. Japan\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)2483. South Korea\n4. United States\n5. New Zealand\nLargest Import Sources\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. Japan\n4. Singapore\n5. Germany\nAs you can see, Australia’s number one trading partner is China. In fact, Chinese\ndemand represents a third of the country’s trade activity. In terms of products, the\nChinese are major importers of Australian iron ore, coal, natural gas, and gold.\nAsia Pac is extremely important to Australia, as more than 70% of its exports are\ndestined for countries within the region. This makes Australia’s economy highly\nsensitive to the performance of countries in the Asian Paciﬁc region. Hiccups in\nChina’s economy can have a signiﬁcant impact on Australia, not only in terms of\nexporting activities but also on housing market activity. At the same time, growth in\nChina is positive for Australia’s economy. During the global ﬁnancial crisis, exports\nto China helped shelter Australia from a major downturn. The relationship between\nChina and Australia is known as Sino-Australian relations. China has recently taken\nsteps to produce its own resources, and if this trend continues, it could dramatically\nchange the landscape of Australia’s economy.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is the central bank of Australia. The monetary\npolicy committee within the central bank consists of the governor (chairman), the\ndeputy governor (vice chairman), secretary to the treasurer, and six independent\nmembers appointed by the government. Changes to monetary policy are made on\nconsensus within the committee.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nThe RBA’s charter states t hat the mandate of the Reserve Bank Board is to focus\nmonetary and banking policy on ensuring:\n1. The stability of the currency of Australia;\n2. The maintenance of full employment in Australia; and\n3. The economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)249In order to achieve these objectives, the government has set an informal consumer\nprice inﬂation target of 2% to 3% per year. The RBA believes that the key to long-\nterm sustainable growth in the economy is to control inﬂation, which would preserve\nthe value of money. In addition, an inﬂation target provides a discipline for monetary\npolicy making and guidelines for private-sector inﬂation expectations. This also\nincreases the transparency of the banks’ activities. Should inﬂation or inﬂation\nexpectations exceed the 2% to 3% target, traders should know that it would raise\nred ﬂags at the RBA and prompt the central bank to favor a tighter monetary policy\nor, in the other words, further rate hikes.\nMonetary policy decisions involve setting the interest rate on overnight loans\nin the money market. Other interest rates in the economy are inﬂuenced by this\ninterest rate to varying degrees, so that the behavior of borrowers and lenders in\nthe ﬁnancial markets is affected by monetary policy (though not only by monetary\npolicy). Through these channels, monetary policy affects the economy in pursuit of\nthe goals just outlined.\nCash Rate\nThe cash rate is the RBA’s target rate for open market operations and is the rate\ncharged on overnight loans between ﬁnancial intermediaries. This means the cash\nrate should have a close relationship with the prevailing money market interest rates.\nChanges in monetary policy directly affect the interest rate structure of the ﬁnancial\nsystem. They also affect sentiment in a currency. Figure 31.1 graphs the AUDUSD\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.01. 2\n1. 1\n1. 0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n6/4/10 6/4/11 6/4/12AUDUSD vs. AU-US 10 Year Spread\n6/4/13 6/4/14 6/4/15\nAU-US Spread AUDUSD\nFIGURE 31.1 AUDUSD vs. 10-Year Yield Spread\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)250against the interest rate differential between Australia and the United States between\n2010 and 2015. There is clearly a positive c orrelation between the 10-year yield\nspread and the currency. Between June 2014 and June 2015, for example, the yield\nspread dropped from 1.5% to 0.5%, and thi s coincided with a drop in the AUDUSD\nfrom 95 to 76 cents.\nMaintaining the Cash Rate: Open Market Operations\nThe focus of daily open market operations is to keep the cash rate close to the target,\nby managing money market liquidity provided to commercial banks. If the Reserve\nBank wishes to decrease the cash rate, it would increase supply of short-dated\nrepurchase agreements at a lower interest rate than the prevailing cash rate, which\nwould in essence decrease the cash rate. If the Reserve Bank wishes to increase\nthe cash rate, it would decrease supply of short-dated repurchase agreements,\nwhich would increase the cash rate. A repurchase agreement involves a cash taker\n(commercial bank) selling securities to a cash provider (RBA), while agreeing to\nrepurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date. This structure\nis similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the cash provider\ninterest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities, ranging from\none day to a few weeks.\nAustralia has had a ﬂoating exchange rate since 1983, and the Reserve Bank\nof Australia may undertake foreign exchange market operations when the market\nthreatens to become excessively volatile or when the exchange rate is clearly\ninconsistent with underlying economic fundamentals. The RBA monitors a trade-\nweighted index (TWI), as well as the cross-rate with the U.S. dollar. Intervention\noperations are invariably aimed at stabilizing market conditions rather than meeting\nexchange rate targets.\nMonetary Policy Meetings\nThe RBA meets every month (except for January), on the ﬁrst Tuesday of each\nmonth, to discuss potential changes in monetary policy. Following each meeting, the\nRBA issues a press release outlining justiﬁcations for its monetary policy changes.\nIf it leaves rates unchanged, no statement is published. The RBA also publishes a\nmonthly Reserve Bank Bulletin . The May and November issues of the Reserve Bank\nBulletin include the semiannual statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy. The\nFebruary, May, August, and November issues contain a Quarterly Report on the\nEconomy and Financial Markets. It is important to read these bulletins for signals on\npotential monetary policy changes.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)251Important Characteristics of the Australian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . Historically, the Australian dollar has had a very strongly\ncorrelation (approximately 80%) with commodity prices and, more speciﬁcally,\ngold and iron ore prices. The correlation stems from the fact that Australia is\nthe world’s second largest gold producer and the world’s largest producer of\niron ore. Therefore, the price of iron ore and gold is extremely important to\nAustralia’s economy. However, unless there is a sharp movement in gold or\niron ore prices, it generally takes time for the AUDUSD to adjust to changes in\nthe price of commodities. Generally speaking, if commodity prices are strong,\ninﬂationary fears start to appear, and the RBA would be inclined to raise rates to\ncurb inﬂation. However, this is a sensitive topic, as gold prices tend to increase\nin times of global economic or political uncertainty. If the RBA increases rates\nduring those conditions, it leaves Australia more vulnerable to spillover effects.\n■Carry trade effects . Australia has one of highest interest rates among the developed\ncountries. With a fairly liquid currency, the Australian dollar is one of the most\npopular currencies to use for carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or\nlending a currency with a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency\nwith a low interest rate. The popularity of the carry trade has contributed to the\n57% rise of the Australian dollar aga inst the U.S. dolla r between 2001 and 2005.\nWhile the carry trade suffered great ly in 2008, it came back strongly between\n2009 and 2011. During this time, many foreign investors were looking for high\nyield when equity investments offered minimal returns. However, carry trades\nonly last as long as the actual yield advantage remains. If global central banks\nincrease their interest rates and the positive interest rate differential between\nAustralia and other countries narro w, the AUDUSD could s uffer from an exodus\nof carry traders.\n■Drought effects . Since the majority of Australia’s exports are commodities, the\ncountry’s GDP is highly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage\nthe country’s farming activities. For example, 2002 was a particularly difﬁcult\nyear for Australia, because the country was experiencing a severe drought. The\ndrought took an extreme toll on Australia’s farming activities, with dry conditions\nhampering the economy throughout the twenty-ﬁrst century. This is important\nbecause agriculture accounts for 3% of the country’s GDP. The RBA estimates\nthat the ‘‘decline in farm production could directly reduce GDP growth by\naround 1 percentage point.’’ Aside from exporting activities, a drought also has\nindirect effects on other aspects of Australia’s economy. Industries that supply and\nservice agriculture, such as the wholesale and transport sectors, as well as retail\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)252operations in rural farming areas, may also be negatively affected by a drought.\nHowever, it is also important to note that the Australian economy has a history\nof recovering strongly after a drought. The 1982–1983 drought ﬁrst subtracted\nthen subsequently added around 1% to 1 1∕2% to GDP growth. The 1991–1995\ndrought reduced GDP by around 1∕2to3∕4percentage points in 1991–1992 and\n1994–1995, but the recovery boosted GDP by 3∕4percentage points.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of Australia\nand the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries should\nalso be closely watched by Australian dollar traders. These differentials can be\ngood indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much premium\nyield Australian dollar short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Australia\nGDP\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services\nin Australia. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Australia ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth generally coincides with a\nweak growth period.\nCPI\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a basket\nof goods and services, which account for a high proportion of expenditure by the\nCPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation, and\nhealth. This is an important indicator to watch, as it is a key input for monetary\npolicy decisions.\nBalance of Goods and Services\nThis number is a monthly measure of Australia’s international trade in goods and\nservices on a balance of payments basis. General merchandise imports and exports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)\nk\nk253\nk\nk\nFIGURE 31.2 AUDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)254are derived mainly from international trade statistics, which are based on Australian\nCustoms Service records. The current account is the balance of trade plus services.\nPrivate Consumption\nThis is a national accounts measure that reﬂects current expenditure by households\nand producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes purchases of\ndurable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure by persons\non the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by unincorporated\nenterprises. This number is important to watch, as private consumption or consumer\nconsumption is the foundation for resilience in the Australian economy.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average\nchanges in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI\ntracks changes in prices for nearly every goods-producing industry in the domestic\neconomy, including agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries,\nmanufacturing, and mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally\nadjusted ﬁnished goods PPI and how the index has reacted on an m/m, q/q, h/h\nand y/y basis. Australia’s PPI data are released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 31.2 illustrates the 10 year performance of AUDUSD.\n255CHAPTER 32\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nNew Zealand Dollar\n(NZD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nNew Zealand is a very small economy with GDP valued at approximately\nUS$183 billion in 2013. In fact, there are less people living in New Zealand\nthan in New York City. It was once one of the most regulated countries within\nthe OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), but over\nthe past two decades the country has been moving toward a more open, modern,\nand stable economy. With the passing of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994, the\ncountry is shifting from an agricultural farming community to one that seeks to\nbecome a leading knowledge-based economy with high skills, high employment,\nand high value-added production. This act sets legal standards that hold the govern-\nment formally responsible to the public for its ﬁscal performance. It also sets the\nframework for the country’s macroeconomic policies. The following are the ﬁve\nprinciples outlined under the Fiscal Responsibility Act:\n1. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; by achieving surpluses on the\noperating budget every year until such a level is reached.\n2. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; and the government must ensure\nthat expenditure is lower than revenue.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)2563. Sufﬁcient levels of Crown net worth must be achieved and maintained to guard\nagainst adverse future events.\n4. Reasonable taxation policies must be followed.\n5. Fiscal risks facing the government must be prudently managed.\nNew Zealand also has highly developed manufacturing and services sectors,\nwith the agricultural industry driving the bulk of the country’s exports. The\neconomy is strongly trade-oriented, with exports of goods and services representing\napproximately one third of GDP. Due to the small size of the economy and its\nsigniﬁcant trade activities, New Zealand is highly sensitive to global performance,\nespecially of its key Asian trading partners, Australia, China, United States, and Japan.\nTogether, Australia, China, and Japan represent 42% of New Zealand’s trading\nactivity. It is also extremely sensitive to exchange rate ﬂuctuations, particularly\nagainst the Australian dollar. The fo llowing lists are a breakdown of the New\nZealand’s most important trading partners:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Australia\n2. China\n3. European Union\n4. United States\n5. Japan\nLeading Import Sources\n1. European Union\n2. China\n3. Australia\n4. United States\n5. Japan\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Reserve\nBank of New Zealand\nMonetary policy in New Zealand is determined by the Reserve Bank (RBNZ).\nThe Monetary Policy Committee is an internal committee of bank executives who\nreview monetary policy on a weekly basis. Meetings to decide on changes to\nmonetary policy occur eight ti mes a year, or approximate ly every six weeks. Unlike\nmost other central banks, the decision for rate changes rests ultimately on the bank’s\ngovernor. The current policy target agreements set by the minister and the governor\nfocus on maintaining policy stability and avoiding unnecessary instability in output,\ninterest rates, and the exchange rate. Price stability refers to maintaining the annual\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)257CPI inﬂation at 1.5%. If the RBNZ does not meet this target, the government has\nthe ability to dismiss the governor of the RBNZ. This is rarely done, but this serves\nas a strong incentive for the RBNZ to meets its inﬂation target. The most common\ntools used by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy changes are the following.\nOfﬁcial Cash Rate (OCR)\nThe Ofﬁcial Cash Rate is the rate set by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy.\nThe Bank lends overnight cash at 25 basis points above the OCR rate and receives\ndeposits or pays interest at 25 basis points below this rate. By controlling the cost\nof liquidity for commercial banks, the RBNZ can inﬂuence the interest rates offered\nto individuals and corporations. This effectively creates a 50 basis point corridor\nthat bounds the interbank overnight rate. The idea is then that banks offering funds\nabove the upper bound will attract few takers, because funds can be borrowed for\na lower cost from the RBNZ. Also, banks offering rates below the lower bound\nwill also attract few takers, because they are offering lower yields than the RBNZ.\nThe ofﬁcial cash rate is reviewed and manipulated with the goal of maintaining\neconomic stability.\nObjectives for Fiscal Policy\nOpen market operations on the other hand are used to meet the cash target. The\ncash target is the targeted amount of reserves held by registered banks. The RBNZ\nprepares forecasts of daily ﬂuctuations on the cash target and will then use these\nforecasts to determine the amount of funds to inject or withdraw in order to meet\nthe cash target. The following government objectives provide a guideline for ﬁscal\nand monetary policy measures:\n■Expenses : Expenses will average around 35% of GDP over the horizon used to\ncalculate contributions toward future New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) costs.\nDuring the buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs, expenses plus contributions\nwill be around 35% of GDP. In the longer term, expenses less withdrawals to\nmeet NZS costs will be around 35% of GDP.\n■Revenue : Raise sufﬁcient revenue to meet the operating balance objective. A\nrobust, broad-based tax system that raises revenue in a fair and efﬁcient way.\n■Operating balance : Operating surplus on average over the economic cycle sufﬁcient\nto meet the requirements for contributions toward future NZS costs and ensure\nconsistency with the debt objective.\n■Debt: Gross debt below 30% of GDP on average over the economic cycle. Net\ndebt, which excludes the assets to meet future NZS costs, below 20% of GDP on\naverage over the economic cycle.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)258■Net worth : Increase net worth consistent with the operating balance objective.\nThis will be achieved through a buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs.\nSource: New Zealand Treasury\n■Important Characteristics of the New Zealand\nDollar\nStrong Correlation with AUD—Competition with Australia\nAustralia is New Zealand’s largest trading partner. This coupled with their geographic\nproximity and New Zealand’s high dependence on trade, creates strong ties between\nthe economies of the two countries. When the Australian economy is healthy and\nAustralian corporations increase their importing activities, New Zealand will be one\nof the ﬁrst to beneﬁt. When it is weak, New Zealand suffers but in recent years\nits sensitivity has diminished because of the country’s growing trade with China\nand other nations. Nonetheless, 22% of trade is still conducted with Australia,\nand this explains why there is a positive correlation between the two currencies.\nFigure 32.1 shows how closely AUDUS D and NZDUSD have moved between 2005\nand 2015.\nCommodity-Linked Currency\nNew Zealand is an export driven economy with commodities representing over\n40% of the country’s exports, and as a result the New Zealand dollar has a strong\ncorrelation with commodity prices, particularly dairy. Fonterra is one of the world’s\n1. 2\n1. 1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.4AUDUSD vs. NZDUSD\n6/30/05 6/30/06 6/30/07 6/30/08 6/30/09 6/30/10 6/30/11 6/30/12 6/30/13 6/30/140.5\nAUDUSD NZDUSD\nFIGURE 32.1 AUDUSD versus NZDUSD\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)259leading dairy producer and also largest company in New Zealand. Twice a month\nthe Global Dairy Trade will conduct an auction and if prices rise, it will be positive\nfor the New Zealand dollar. If prices fall, it will be negative for the currency\nbecause it can mean reduced payout and proﬁt for dairy producers. The correlation\nbetween Australian and New Zealand dollars also contributes to the NZD’s status as a\n‘‘commodity linked’’ currency. Therefore, the New Zealand dollar’s correlation with\ncommodity prices is not only limited to its own trade activities. Therefore, as com-\nmodity prices increase, the Australian economy beneﬁts, translating into increased\nactivity in all aspects of the country’s operations, including trade with New Zealand.\nCarry Trades\nOf the industrialized countries, New Zealand tends to maintain the highest interest\nrate as it needs to offer investors a higher yield to compensate for the risk of\ninvesting in a small economy. This yield advantage along with its secure credit rating\nhas made the New Zealand dollar one of the most popular currencies to purchase\nfor carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. The\npopularity of the carry trade has contributed to the rise of the New Zealand dollar in\nan environment where many global investors are looking for opportunities to earn\nhigh yield. However, this also makes the New Zealand dollar particularly sensitive\nto changes in interest rates. That is, when the United States begins increasing their\ninterest rates, while New Zealand stays on hold or reduces their interest rates, the\ncarry advantage of the New Zealand dollar would narrow. In such situations, the\nNew Zealand dollar could come under pressure as speculators reverse their carry\ntrade positions.\nInterest Rate Differentials\nInterest rate differentials between the cash rates of New Zealand and the short\nterm interest rate yields of other industrialized countries are closely watched by\nprofessional NZD traders. These differentials can be good indicators of potential\nmoney ﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield NZD short-term ﬁxed-\nincome assets are offering over foreign short-term ﬁxed income assets, or vice versa.\nThis differential provides traders with indications of potential currency movements,\nas investors are always looking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly\nimportant to carry traders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive\ninterest rate differentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\nPopulation Migration\nAs mentioned earlier, New Zealand has a very small population, less than half of\nNew York City. Therefore, changes in migration can have signiﬁcant effects on the\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)260economy. Between 2013 an d 2014, the population of New Zealand increased by\n78,800 people, which was the largest net migration in at least 90 years. Between\n2011 and 2012, for example, the population only grew by 26,400 people. Although\nthese absolute numbers appear small, it is fairly signiﬁcant for New Zealand because\nof the size of the population. In fact, this strong population migration into New\nZealand has contributed signiﬁcantly to the performance of the economy, because\nas the population increases, the demand for household goods increases, leading to\nan increase in overall consumer consumption.\nDrought Effects\nSince the bulk of New Zealand’s exports are commodities, the country’s GDP is\nhighly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage the country’s farming\nactivities. In 2013, droughts cost the country over $1.3 billion. In addition, droughts\nare also very frequent in Australia, New Zealand’s largest trading partner, and when\nthey occur it can have a negative impact on the New Zealand economy.\n■Important Economic Indicators for New Zealand\nNew Zealand does not release economic indicators often; however, when they do,\nthe following items are the most important:\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a quarterly measure of the total production and consumption of goods and\nservices in New Zealand. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households,\nbusinesses, government, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used\nto convert output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. This data are\nused to gauge where in the business cycle New Zealand ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often\nis perceived inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nConsumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a\n‘‘basket’’ of goods and services that account for a high proportion of expenditure by\nthe CPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation,\nand health. This is an important indicator to watch, as monetary policy changes are\nhighly inﬂuenced by this index as it is a measure of inﬂation.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)\nk\nk261\nk\nk\nFIGURE 32.2 NZDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)262Balance of Goods and Services\nNew Zealand’s Balance of Payments statements are records of the value of New\nZealand’s transactions in goods, services, income, and transfers with the rest of the\nworld, and the changes in New Zealand’s ﬁnancial claims on (assets), and liabilities\nto, the rest of the world. New Zealand’s International Investment Position statement\nshows, at a particular point in time, the stock of a country’s international ﬁnancial\nassets and international ﬁnancial liabilities.\nRetail Sales Ex Inﬂation\nCredit card spending numbers are released for New Zealand on a monthly basis but\nthe retail sales data is quarterly on an ex inﬂation basis. This measure tracks the\nresale of new and used goods to the public for personal or household consumption.\nIt is also an important input into GDP.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a m/m, q/q, h/h, and y/y basis. New\nZealand’s PPI data is released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 32.2 illustrates the 10-year performance of NZDUSD.\n263CHAPTER 33\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nCanadian Dollar\n(CAD)\n■Broad Economic Performance\nCanada is the world’s eleventh largest country with GDP valued at US$1.8 trillion as\nof 2014. As a resource-based economy, the country’s early economic development\nhinged on the development, exploitation, and exports of natural resources. It is\nnow the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold. However, in actuality,\nnearly two-thirds of the country’s GDP comes from the service sector, which also\nemploys three out of four Canadians. The strength in the service sector is partly\nattributed to the trend by businesses to subcontract a large portion of their services.\nThis may include a manufacturing company subcontracting delivery services to a\ntransportation company. Despite this, manufacturing and resources are still very\nimportant for the Canadian economy, as it represents over 25% of the country’s\nexports and is a primary source of income for a number of provinces.\nThe Canadian economy started to advance with the depreciation of its currency\nagainst the U.S. dollar and the Free Trade Agreement that came into effect in January\n1989. This agreement eliminated almost all trade tariffs between the United States\nand Canada. As a result, Canada now exports over 85% of its goods to the United\nStates. Further negotiations to incorporate Mexico created the North American Free\nTrade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect on January 1994. This more advanced\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)264treaty eliminated most tariffs on trading b etween all three countries. Canada’s close\ntrade relationship with the United States makes it particularly sensitive to the health\nof the U.S. economy. If the U.S. economy sputters, demand for Canadian exports\nwould suffer. The same is true for the opposite scenario; if U.S. economic growth\nis robust, Canadian exports will beneﬁt. In the past decade, trade with China has\nalso increased signiﬁcantly, rising in the ranks from the ﬁfth to the second most\nimportant trade partner for Canada. The following is a breakdown of Canada’s key\nexport and import markets:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. United Kingdom\n4. Japan\n5. Mexico\nLeading Import Sources\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Japan\n4. Mexico\n5. United Kingdom\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Governing Council of the Bank of Canada is the board that is responsible for\nsetting Canadian monetary policy. This council consists of seven members: the\ngovernor and six deputy governors. The Bank of Canada meets approximately eight\ntimes per year to discuss changes in monetary policy. They also release a monthly\nmonetary policy update every quarter, but the rate decision itself is the big market\nmover for the currency.\nCentral Bank Goals\nThe Bank of Canada’s primary focus is on maintaining the ‘‘integrity and value of\nthe currency,’’ and this involves ensuring pri ce stability. Price stability is maintained\nby adhering to an inﬂation target currently set by the Department of Finance at\n1% to 3%. The Bank believes that high inﬂation can damage the functioning of the\neconomy. In their opinion, low inﬂation on the other hand equates to price stability,\nwhich can help to foster sustainable long-term economic growth. The BoC controls\ninﬂation through short-term interest rates. If inﬂation is above the target, the Bank\nwill apply tighter monetary conditions. If it is below the target, the Bank will loosen\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)265monetary policy. Overall, the central bank has done a pretty good job of keeping\nthe inﬂation target within the band since 1998.\nThe Bank measures monetary conditions using its Monetary Conditions Index,\nwhich is a weighted sum of changes in the 90-day commercial paper rate and G-10\ntrade-weighted exchange rates. The weight of the interest rate versus the exchange\nrate is 3 to 1, which is the affect of a chan ge in interest rates on the exchange rate\nbased on historical studies. This means that a 1% increase in short-term interest\nrates is the same as a 3% appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate. To\nchange monetary policy, the BoC manipulates the Bank Rate, which can in turn\naffect the exchange rate. If the currency appreciates to undesirable levels, the BoC\ncan decrease interest rates to offset the rise. If it depreciates, the BoC can raise rates.\nHowever, interest rate changes are not used for the purposes of manipulating the\nexchange rate. Instead, they are used to control inﬂation but an excessively strong\ncurrency and lower inﬂationary pressures can accelerate the changes. The following\nare the most commonly used tools by the BoC to implement monetary policy.\nBank Rate\nThe Bank Rate is the main rate used to control inﬂation. This is the rate of interest\nthat the Bank of Canada charges to commercial banks. Changes to this rate will affect\nother interest rates, including mortgage rates and prime rates charged by commercial\nbanks. Therefore, changes to this rate will ﬁlter into the overall economy.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) is the framework for the Bank of Canada’s\nimplementation of monetary policy. It is through this framework that Canada’s\ncommercial banks borrow and lend overnight money to each other in order to fund\ntheir daily transactions. The LVTS is an electronic platform through which these\nﬁnancial institutions conduct large transactions. The interest rate charged on these\novernight loans is called the overnight rate or bank rate. The BoC can manipulate the\novernight rate by offering to lend at rates lower or higher than the current market\nrate if the overnight lending rate is trading above or below the target banks.\nOn a regular basis, the bank releases a number of publications that are important to\nfollow. This includes a biannual Monetary Policy Report that contains an assessment of\nthe current economic environment and implications for inﬂation and a quarterly Bank\nof Canada Review that includes economic commentary, featured articles, speeches by\nmembers of the Governing Council, and important announcements.\nImportant Characteristics of the Canadian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . As the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold,\nCanada’s economy is highly dependent on commodities. This creates a strong\npositive correlation between the Canadian dollar and oil prices. Generally\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)266speaking, when oil prices rise, it beneﬁts domestic producers and increases their\nincome from exports. However at the same time, strong commodity prices can\nhurt growth abroad; so while rising oil prices are initially positive for Canada,\nthe negative impact on global growth could lead to a decline in demand over the\nmedium term. On the ﬂip side, falling oil prices are negative for the Canadian\ndollar; but if prices remain low and global growth beneﬁts, it can eventually\nneutralize the negative impact.\n■Strong correlation with the United States . Since the 1980s, Canada has been running\nmerchandise trade surpluses with the United States and now approximately 77%\nof Canadian exports are bound for the Untied States. This heavy reliance on U.S.,\ndemand makes Canada extremely sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy. As the\nU.S. economy accelerates, trade increases with Canadian companies, lifting overall\neconomic activity. However, as the U.S. economy slows, the Canadian economy\nwill be hurt signiﬁcantly as U.S. companies reduce their importing activities.\n■Mergers and acquisitions . Due to the proximity of the United States and Canada,\ncross-border mergers and acquisitions are very common, as companies worldwide\nstrive for globalization. These mergers and acquisitions lead to money ﬂowing\nbetween the two countries, which ulti mately impacts the currencies. In 2001,\nthe signiﬁcant U.S. acquisition of Canadian energy companies infused US$25\nbillion into Canada. This led to a strong rally in USDCAD, as the U.S. companies\nneeded to sell USD and buy CAD to pay for their acquisitions. Any similar type\nof M&A ﬂow in the future will also have a signiﬁcant but short-term impact on\nthe Canadian dollar.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of\nCanada and the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries\nare closely watched by professional Canadian dollar traders. These differentials\ncan be good indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much\npremium yield Canadian short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, and vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Carry trades . A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. When\nCanada has a higher interest rate than th e United States, the short USDCAD carry\ntrade becomes more attractive; but if th e United States emba rks on a tightening\ncampaign or Canada lowers rates, the positive interest rate differential between\nthe Canadian dollar and other currencies would narrow. In such situations, the\nCanadian dollar could come under pressure if the speculators begin to exit out of\ntheir carry trades.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)267■Important Economic Indicators for Canada\nCanadian economic reports can have a signiﬁcant impact on the currency. Here are\na handful of the most important releases.\nCanadian Employment\nEvery month, Canada releases its labor market report and this report provides more\ndetails than that of the United States. Job growth is expressed as net job growth and\nthen split into full- and part-time hirers. Generally speaking, the market prefers that\nthe bulk of job growth is full time, because it represents real long-term employment\nand not short-term hires that can be laid off at any time. The unemployment rate is\nalso released, and the number of unemployed persons is expressed as a percentage\nof the labor force.\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\nThe monthly consumer price report measures the average rate of increase in prices.\nWhen economists speak of inﬂation as an economic problem, they generally mean\na persistent increase in the general price level over a period of time, resulting in a\ndecline in a currency’s purchasing power. Inﬂation is often measured as a percentage\nincrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Canada’s inﬂation policy, as set out\nby the federal government and the Bank of Canada, aims to keep inﬂation within\na target range of 1% to 3%. If the rate of inﬂation is 10% a year, $100 worth of\npurchases last year will, on average, cost $110 this year. At the same inﬂation rate,\nthose purchases will cost $121 next year, and so on.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nThe gross domestic product measures the total value of all goods and services\nproduced within Canada during a given year. It is a measure of the income generated\nby production within Canada. GDP is also referred to as economic output. To\navoid counting the same output more than once, GDP includes only ﬁnal goods\nand services—not those that are used to make another product. For example, GDP\nwould not include the wheat used to make bread, but would include the bread itself.\nTrade Balance\nThe balance of trade is a statement of a country’s trade in goods (merchandise) and\nservices. It covers trade in products such as manufactured goods, raw materials, and\nagricultural goods, as well as travel and transportation. The balance of trade is the\ndifference between the value of the goods and services that a country exports and\nthe value of the goods and services that it imports. If a country’s exports exceed its\nimports, it has a trade surplus and the trade balance is said to be positive. If imports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)268\nFIGURE 33.1 USDCAD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nexceed exports, the country has a trade deﬁcit, and its trade balance is said to be\nnegative.\nRetail Sales\nRetail sales is a monthly national accounts measure that calculates current expenditure\nby households and producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes\npurchases of durable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure\nby persons on the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by\nunincorporated enterprises. Stronger consumer spending is positive for Canada’s\neconomy and, in turn, the Canadian dollar, whereas weaker consumer spending is\nnegative for Canada’s economy and currency.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.\nFigure 33.1 illustrates the 10-year

        "213CHAPTER 27\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nEuro (EUR)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe European Union (EU) was developed as an institutional framework for the\nconstruction of a united Europe. As of May 2015, the EU consists of 28 member\ncountries with 19 of these nations sharing the euro as a common currency. The\nEurozone consists of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,\nGreece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,\nPortugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. With the exception of Denmark and the\nUnited Kingdom, other EU states are obliged to join the monetary union when they\nmeet the criteria to do so. Aside from a common currency, these countries also\nshare a single monetary policy dictated by the European Central Bank (ECB). These\ncommon currency countries constitute the European Monetary Union (EMU).\nThe EMU is the world’s second largest economic power, with gross domestic\nproduct valued at approximately US$18 trillion in 2014. With a highly developed\nﬁxed income, equity, and futures market, the EMU is the second most attractive\ninvestment market for domestic and international investors. In its early days, the\nEMU found difﬁculty attracting foreign direct investment or large capital ﬂows\nbecause, historically, the U.S. markets are larger with more consistent returns. As\na result, the U.S. absorbs 71% of total foreign savings. However, with the euro\nbecoming an established currency and the European Monetary Union incorporating\nmore members, the euro’s importance as a reserve currency is rising and translating\ninto greater capital ﬂows. The only problem is that European bond markets are\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)214fragmented, and there are not enough quality assets for central banks to invest in.\nUnless there are euro bonds, foreign central banks could be slow to diversify their\nreserve holdings. Nonetheless, they will do so gradually, providing ongoing support\nfor the euro.\nTrade is extremely important to Eurozone nations and most countries conduct\nthe majority of their trade with other states in the region. This is important because\none of the most valuable aspects of the euro is its facilitation of trade activity through\nthe elimination of exchange rate risk. Large Eurozone nations such as Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Spain also conduct signiﬁcant trade activity with countries like the\nUnited States and China. This makes the value of the euro particularly important\nto economic activity. A country like the United States is less sensitive to exchange\nrate ﬂuctuations because most of its demand is internal, but Europe is extremely\nsensitive to its exchange rate because many Eurozone nations rely on external\ndemand. The size and scope of the EMU’s trade with the rest of the world provides\nit with signiﬁcant power in the international trade arena. International clout is also\none of the primary goals in the formation of the European Union, because it allows\nindividual nations to negotiate as a group on an equal playing ﬁeld with the United\nStates and China, their two largest trading partners. The breakdowns of the most\nimportant trading partners for the European Union are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Switzerland\n4. Russia\n5. Turkey\nLeading Import Sources\n1. China\n2. Russia\n3. United States\n4. Norway\n5. Switzerland\nWhile trade is extremely important, the service sector has the largest share of\ntotal output followed by manufacturing. In fact, a large number of the companies\nwhose primary purpose is to produce ﬁnished products still concentrate their EU\nactivity on innovation, research, design, and marketing, while outsourcing most of\ntheir manufacturing activities to Asia.\nThe EU’s growing role in international trade has major implications for the role of\nthe euro as a reserve currency. As more countries conduct trade with the Eurozone,\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)215they will be motivated to accumulate more euros to reduce exchange risk and\ntransaction costs. Traditionally, most international trade transactions involve the\nBritish pound, the Japanese yen, and/or the U.S. dollar. Before the establishment of\nthe euro, it was unreasonable to hold large amounts of every individual EU national\ncurrency. As a result, currency reserves tended toward the dollar. At the end of the\n1990s, approximately 65% of all world reserves were held in U.S. dollars, but after\nthe introduction of the euro, foreign reserve assets slowly shifted towards the euro.\nThis trend will only continue as the world becomes more globalized.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nMakers—The European Central Bank\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is the governing body responsible for determining\nthe monetary policy of the countries participating in the EMU. The Executive Board\nof the EMU consists of the president of the ECB, the vice president of the ECB, and\nfour other members. These individuals, along with the governors of the national\ncentral banks, comprise the Governing Council. The ECB is set up such that the\nExecutive Board implements the policies dictated by the Governing Council. New\nmonetary policies decisions are typically made by majority vote, with the president\nhaving the casting vote in the event of a tie in their monthly meeting. After each\nmeeting the Central Bank president holds a press conference to answer questions.\nThis is also used as an opportunity to clarify their monetary policy stance.\nThe EMU’s primary objective is to maintain price stability and promote growth.\nMonetary and ﬁscal policy changes are made to ensure that this objective is met. With\nthe formation of the EMU, the Maastric ht Treaty was developed by the Union to\napply a number of criteria for each member country. These criteria were developed\nby the Union to help them achieve their objective. Deviations from these criteria\nby any one country will result in heavy ﬁnes. Listed below are the EMU criteria.\nIt is apparent based on these criteria that the ECB has a strict mandate focused on\ninﬂation and deﬁcit. Generally, the ECB strives to maintain annual growth in HCPI\n(Harmonized Consumer Price Index) below 2% and M3 (Money Supply) annual\ngrowth around 4.5%.\nThe EMU Criteria\nIn the 1992 Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) the following\npreconditions were created for any EU member state looking to join the economic\nand monetary union (EMU).\n■A rate of inﬂation no more than 1.5% above the average of the three best\nperforming member states, taking the average of the 12-month year-on-year rate\npreceding the assessment date.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)216■Long-term interest rates not exceeding the average rates of these low-inﬂation\nstates by more than 2% for the preceding 12 months.\n■Exchange rates which ﬂuctuate within the normal margins of the exchange-rate\nmechanism (ERM) for at least two years.\n■A general government debt/GDP ratio of not more than 60%, although a higher\nratio may be permissible if it is ‘‘sufﬁciently diminishing.’’\n■A general government deﬁcit not exceeding 3% of GDP, although a small and\ntemporary excess can be permitted.\nIf a country meets the convergence criteria and joins the EMU, their monetary\npolicy will be determined by the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB and the\nESCB (European System of Central Banks) are independent institutions from both\nnational governments and other EU institutions, granting them complete control\nover monetary policy. This operational independence is accorded to them as per\nArticle 108 of the Maastricht Treaty, which states that any member of the decision-\nmaking bodies cannot seek or take instructions from any Community Institutions,\nany government of a member state, or any other body. In other words, no one\ncountry can pressure the ECB into making a monetary policy change that is in only\ntheir best interest. The primary tools the ECB uses to control monetary policy is the\nfollowing.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe ECB has four main categories of open market operations to steer interest rates,\nmanage liquidity, and signal monetary policy stance. This includes:\n■Main reﬁnancing operations . These are regular liquidity-providing reverse transac-\ntions conducted weekly with a maturity o f two weeks, which provide the bulk of\nreﬁnancing to the ﬁnancial sector.\n■Longer-term reﬁnancing operations . These are liquidity-providing reverse transactions\nwith a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months, which provide\ncounterparties with additional longer-term reﬁnancing.\n■Fine-tuning operations . These are executed on an ad-hoc basis, with the aim of\nboth managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates, in\nparticular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected\nliquidity ﬂuctuations.\n■Structural operations . These involve the issuance of debt certiﬁcates, reverse trans-\nactions, and outright transactions. These operations will be executed whenever\nthe ECB wishes to adjust th e structural position of the Eurosystem vis-` a-vis the\nﬁnancial sector (on a regular or nonregular basis).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)217ECB Minimum Bid Rate (Repo Rate)\nThe ECB minimum bid rate is the key policy target for the ECB and the level of\nborrowing that the ECB offers to the central banks of its member states. This is also\nthe rate that is subject to change at the monthly ECB meetings. Since inﬂation is a\nmajor concern for European policy makers, they are generally more inclined to keep\ninterest rates at lofty levels to prevent inﬂation. Changes in the ECB’s minimum bid\nrate can have large ramiﬁcations for the EUR.\nThe ECB does not have an exchange rate target, but will factor in exchange rates\nin their policy deliberations because they can affect price stability. A high exchange\nrate lowers inﬂationary pressures while a low exchange rate promotes it. The ECB is\nnot prohibited from intervening in the foreign exchange markets if they believe that\ninﬂation is a concern. As a result, comments by members of the Governing Council\nare closely watched by forex traders and can have a signiﬁcant impact on the euro.\nIn addition to their monthly meetings, the Central Bank will also publish a\nmonthly bulletin and release staff forecasts and minutes from past meetings. The\npresident of the Central Bank holds a press conference after the policy meeting and\nthat, along with each of these event risk s, can cause volatility in the currency.\nNow let’s take a look at some of the important characteristics of the euro:\n■EURUSD cross is the most liquid and actively traded currency . The euro was introduced\nas an electronic currency in January 1999. At the time, the euro replaced all\npre-EMU currencies, except for Greece’s currency, which was converted to the\neuro in January 2001. As a result, the EURUSD cross is now the most liquid\ncurrency in the world and its movements are used as the primary gauge of the\nhealth of both the European and U.S. economies. Figure 27.1 highlights the\n10 year performance of EUR-USD. The euro is most frequently known as the\n‘‘anti-dollar’’ since dollar or U.S. fundamentals generally have a greater impact\non the movement of the currency.\nEURJPY and EURCHF are also very liquid currencies that can be used as a\ngauge of the health of the Japanese and Swiss economies. Many new traders will\nstart with the EURUSD because of its orderly movements, tight spread, and\nliquidity.\n■Euro: A currency without a country . One of the greatest problems of the euro is that it\nis currency without a country. Instead, it bears the economic, political, and social\nrisks of 19 different nations. This is its gr eatest strength and its greatest weakness.\nIn the past decade, we have seen how the debt crisis in smaller Eurozone nations\nhave affected the currency as a whole. It undermines conﬁdence and has, on many\noccasions, put the entire monetary union at risk.\n■Spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and 10-year Bunds can indicate euro sentiment .\nTen-year government bonds can serve as an important indicator of where the euro\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)218\nFIGURE 27.1 EURUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)219is headed, especially against the U.S. dollar. The differential between the 10-year\nU.S. government bond and the 10-year German Bund rates can provide a good\nindication for EURUSD’s movement. If Bund rates are higher than U.S. Treasury\nrates and the differential increases, or the spread widens, this is generally positive\nfor the EURUSD. Alternatively, a decrease in the differential or a tightening of\nthe interest rates is generally bearish for EURUSD. As there is no Euro bond,\nthe 10-year German Bund yield is typically used as the benchmark bond for the\nEurozone because Germany is the largest country in the monetary union.\n■Predictions for euro area money ﬂows . Another useful rate to follow is the three-month\ninterest rate, also known as the euro interbank offer rate or the Euribor rate. This\nis the rate offered from one large bank to another on interbank term deposits.\nTraders tend to compare the Euribor futures rate with the Eurodollar futures rate.\nEurodollars are deposits denominated in U.S. dollars at banks and other ﬁnancial\ninstitutions outside the United States. Because investors like high-yielding assets,\nEuropean ﬁxed-income assets become more attractive as the spread between\nEuribor futures and Eurodollar futures widens in favor of Euribors. As the spread\nnarrows, European assets become less attractive, whereby implying a potential\ndecrease in money ﬂows into the Euro.\nMergers and acquisition activity can also affect how the EURUSD moves.\nIn recent years we have seen increased M&A activity between EU and U.S.\nmultinationals. Large deals, especially with a large cash component, can lead to a\nsudden burst in the EURUSD, but the reaction is generally short-lived.\n■Important Indicators for the Euro\nWhen it comes to Eurozone economic reports, the only ones that affect the euro are\nGerman or Eurozone data. The largest countries in the Eurozone in order of GDP\ncontribution are Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. While French and Italian data\nare important, they rarely move the currency. So what forex traders should focus on\nare the broader regional reports and German data. Central bank rate decisions are\nthe most important, but here are some additional economic reports that can have\nmeaningful impact on the currency.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the Manufacturing\nand Service sectors. For the Eurozone, they provide this data for the four largest\neconomies and a composite index for the region. These numbers are extremely\nmarket moving because they provide the most up-to-date information on how each\nof the economies are performing in the current month and not how the economies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)220performed the previous month like many other reports. However, since the reports\nare for the current period, they are usually subject to revisions so the euro will\nmove on the preliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents\nexpansion, and a reading below 50 represents contraction. For the Eurozone, the\nmanufacturing PMI index is the most important along with the composite index,\nwhich aggregates how the manufacturing and service sector are performing. Since\nthe German data are released shortly before the Eurozone report, they can have a\ngreater impact on the currency.\nIFO Survey\nGermany is by far the largest economy in Europe and is responsible for approximately\n20% of total GDP. Any insight into German business conditions is seen as an insight\ninto Europe as a whole. The IFO is a monthly survey conducted by the IFO institute.\nThey survey over 7,000 German businesses, asking for their assessment of the\nGerman business climate and their short-term plans. The initial publication of the\nresults consists of the business climate headline ﬁgure and its two equally weighted\nsubindices: current business conditions and business expectations. The typical range\nis from 80 to 120, with a higher number indicating greater business conﬁdence. The\nreport is most valuable, however, when measured against previous data.\nInﬂation Indicators—HICP\nSince the ECB has an inﬂation mandate, the EU Harmonized Index of Consumer\nPrices (HICP) published by Eurostat is very important. This harmonized index is\ndesigned for international comparison as required by EU law. The index is compiled\nwith information on prices retrieved by each national statistical agency. Individual\ncountries are required to provide Eurostat with the 100 indices used to compute the\nHICP. The national HICPs are totaled by Eurostat as a weighted average of these\nsubindices, and the weights used are country-speciﬁc. The HICP is released at the\nend of the month following the reference period, which is about 10 days after the\npublications of the national CPIs from Spain and France, the ﬁnal EMU-5 countries\nto release their CPIs. Even if part of the information is already known when the\nHICP is released, it is an important release because it serves as the reference inﬂation\nindex for the ECB who aims to keep Eurozone consumer price inﬂation between\n0% and 2%.\nGerman Industrial Production\nIndustrial production data are seasonally adjusted (SA) and include a breakdown into\nfour major subcategories: mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction. The\nmanufacturing aggregate comprises four main product groups: basic and producer\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)221goods, capital goods, consumer durables, and consumer nondurables. The market\ntends to pay attention to the annual rate of change and the seasonally adjusted\nmonth-on-month ﬁgure. Germany’s ﬁgure is most important since it is the largest\ncountry in the Eurozone; however, the market can also react to the French industrial\nproduction report. The initial industrial production release is based on a narrower\ndata sample and hence subject to revision when the full sample has become available.\nThe ministry occasionally provides insight on the expected direction of the revision\nin the initial data release.\nGerman Unemployment\nLabor market numbers are important for every country and in the case of the\nEurozone, German unemployment is the most important. Released by the Labor\nOfﬁce, the data contain information on the number of unemployed, as well as\nthe changes on the previous month, on both seasonally (SA) and nonseasonally\n(NSA) adjusted terms. The NSA unemployment rate is provided, along with data\non vacancies, short-shift working arrangements, and the number of employees\n(temporarily suspended in 1999). Within an hour after the FLO release, the\nBundesbank releases the SA unemployment rate. The day ahead of the release,\nthere is often a leak of the ofﬁcial data from a trade-union source. The leak is\nusually of the NSA level of unemployment in millions. When a precise ﬁgure is\nreported on Reuters, as given by ‘‘sources’’ for the NSA level of unemployment,\nthe leak usually reﬂects t he ofﬁcial ﬁgures. Rumors often circulate up to one week\nbefore the ofﬁcial release, and they are notoriously imprecise. Regardless, a drop\nin unemployment along with an improvement in the jobless rate is positive for the\ncurrency, whereas a rise in jobless claims or increase in the unemployment rate is\nnegative for the currency.\nPreliminary GDP\nPreliminary GDP is issued when Eurostat has collected data from a sufﬁcient number\nof countries to produce an estimate. This usually includes France, Germany, and\nthe Netherlands. However, Italy is not included in the preliminary release and is\nonly added in the ﬁnal number. The yearly aggregates for EU-15 and EMU-11\nare a simple sum of national GDP. For the quarterly accounts, the aggregation is\nmore complex since some countries (Greece, Ireland, and Luxembourg) do not\nyet produce quarterly national accounts data. Moreover, Portugal produces only\npartial quarterly accounts with a signiﬁcant lag. Thus, both the EU-15 and EMU-11\nquarterly paths are the result of estimates from quarterly data based on a group of\ncountries accounting for more than 95% of total EU GDP (see the Foreword for a\ndetailed description of the weights of each country in the EU).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)222M3\nM3 is a broad measure of money supply, which includes everything from notes\nand coins to bank deposits. The ECB closely monitors M3 as they view it as a key\nmeasure of inﬂation. At its session in December 1998, the governing council of the\nECB set its ﬁrst reference value for M3 growth at 4.5%. This value supports inﬂation\nb e l o w2 % ,t r e n dg r o w t ho f2 %t o2 . 5 % ,a n dal o n g - t e r md e c l i n ei nt h ev e l o c i t y\nof money by 0.5% to 1%. The growth rate is monitored on a three-month moving\naverage basis in order to prevent monthly volatility to distort the information given\nby the aggregate. The ECB’s approach to monetary targeting leaves considerable\nroom for maneuver and interpretation. Because the ECB does not impose bands\non M3 growth, as the Bundesbank used to do, there will be no automatic action\nwhen M3 growth diverges from the reference value. Moreover, although the ECB\nconsiders M3 to be the key indicator, it will also take into account the changes in\nother monetary aggregates.\nIndividual Country Budget Deﬁcits\nThe Stability and Growth Pact states that budget deﬁcits for every country in the\nmonetary union must be kept below 3% of GDP. Failure to meet these targets will\nbe punished. However through the years many Eurozone nations have had deﬁcits\nin excess of 3% and penalties have not been enforced.\n223CHAPTER 28\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nBritish Pound (GBP)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe United Kingdom is the world’s ﬁfth largest economy with GDP valued at\napproximately US$3 trillion in 2014 according to the IMF. With one of the most\ndynamic central banks in the world, the UK economy beneﬁted from many years of\nstrong growth, low unemployment, expa nding output, and resilient consumption.\nThe strength of consumer consumption has been largely due to the strong housing\nmarket. The United Kingdom is a service-oriented economy, with manufacturing\nrepresenting an increasingly smaller portion of GDP, now equivalent to only one-\nﬁfth of national output. Their capital market system is one of the most developed\nin the world, with ﬁnance and banking being the strongest contributors to GDP.\nAlthough the majority of the UK’s GDP is from services, it is also one of the\nlargest producers and exporters of natural gas in the European Union. The energy\nproduction industry accounts for 10% of GDP, which is one of the highest shares of\nany industrialized nation. This is particularly important, as increases in energy prices\n(such as oil) will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt the large number of UK oil exporters. (The\nUnited Kingdom became a net oil importer for a brief period due to disruptions in\nthe North Sea in 2003, but it has already resumed its status as a net oil exporter.)\nOverall, the United Kingdom is a net importer of goods with a consistent\ntrade deﬁcit. Its largest trading partner is the EU, with trade between the two\nconstituencies accounting for over 50% of all of the country’s import and export\nactivities. The United States, on an individual basis, still remains the United\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)224Kingdom’s largest trading partner. The breakdowns of the most important trading\npartners for the United Kingdom are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. Germany\n3. Switzerland\n4. Netherlands\n5.

France\nSince the launch of the euro in 1999, the single currency’s troubles have become\nincreasingly apparent, and this has made the UK’s decision to maintain its own\ncurrency and monetary authority increasingly intelligent. Yet the possibility of euro\nadoption will remain a question in the minds of pound traders for many years\nto come, although in 2015 into 2016, the more relevant question is whether the\nUnited Kingdom will remain in the EMU. A decision on euro entry has signiﬁcant\nramiﬁcations for the UK economy—the most important of which is that UK interest\nrates would have to be adjusted to reﬂect the equivalent interest rate of the Eurozone.\nOne of the primary arguments against adopting the euro is that the UK government\nhas sound macroeconomic policies that have worked very well for the country for\ndecades. Its successful monetary and ﬁscal policies have led it to outperform most\nmajor economies during economic downturns, including the European Union.\nThe UK Treasury has previously speciﬁed ﬁve economic tests that must be met\nprior to euro entry, which are the following:\nUK’s Five Economic Tests for Euro\n1. Is there sustainable convergence in business cycles and economic structures\nbetween the United Kingdom and other EMU members, so that the UK citizens\ncould live comfortably with euro interest rates on a permanent basis?\n2. Is there enough ﬂexibility to cope with economic change?\n3. Would joining the EMU create an environment that would encourage ﬁrms to\ninvest in the United Kingdom?\n4. Would joining the EMU have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the\nUK’s ﬁnancial services industry?\n5. Would joining the EMU be good for promoting stability and growth in\nemployment?\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)225The United Kingdom is a very political country where government ofﬁcials are\nhighly concerned with voter approval. If voters do not support euro entry, the\nlikelihood of EMU entry would decline. The following are some of the arguments\nfor and against adopting the euro:\nArguments in Favor of Adopting the Euro\n■There would be reduced exchange rate uncertainty for UK businesses and lower\nexchange rate transa ction costs or risks.\n■The prospect of sustained low inﬂation under the governance of the European\nCentral Bank should reduce long-term interest rates and stimulate sustained\neconomic growth.\n■Single currency promotes price transparency.\n■The integration of national ﬁnancial markets of the EU will lead to higher efﬁciency\nin the allocation of capital in Europe.\n■The euro is the second most important reserve currency after the USD.\n■With the United Kingdom joining the euro, the political clout of the EMU would\nincrease dramatically.\nArguments against Adopting the Euro\n■Currency unions have collapsed in the past.\n■Economic or political instabilities of one country would impact the Euro, which\nwould have exchange rate ramiﬁcations for otherwise healthy countries.\n■Strict EMU criteria outlined by the Stability and Growth Pact.\n■Entry would mean a permanent transfer of domestic monetary authority to the\nEuropean Central Bank.\n■Joining a currency union with no monetary ﬂexibility would require the United\nKingdom to have more ﬂexibility in the labor and housing markets.\n■There are fears about which countries might dominate the ECB.\n■Adjusting to new currency will require large transaction costs.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Bank\nof England\nFor the United Kingdom, the Bank of England (BoE) controls monetary policy, and\nthe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is a nine-member committee responsible\nfor setting interest rate policy in the United Kingdom. It consists of a governor,\ntwo deputy governors, two executive directors of the central bank, and four outside\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)226experts. The committee was granted operational independence in 1997, which\nmeans they won’t be inﬂuenced by the governing party. Despite this independence,\nmonetary policies have centered on achieving an inﬂation target dictated by the\nChancellor of the Treasury. Currently, this target is RPIX (Retail Price Index)\ninﬂation of 2.5%. The central bank has the power to change interest rates to levels\nthat will allow them to meet this target. The MPC holds monthly meetings, which\nare closely followed for announcements on changes in monetary policy, including\nchanges in the interest rate (bank repo rate). When no changes are made, no details\nare provided. In this case, the rate decision is generally a nonevent for the currency,\nwith traders shifting their focus to the minutes released two weeks later.\nThe MPC publishes statements after every meeting, along with a quarterly\nInﬂation Report that details the MPC’s two-year forecast for growth and inﬂation\nalong with justiﬁcation for policy movements. In addition, another publication,\ntheQuarterly Bulletin, provides information on past monetary policy movements\nand analysis of the international economic environment and its impacts on the UK\neconomy. All of these reports can provide guidance of future policy changes. The\nmain policy tools used by the MPC and BoE are the following.\nBank Repo Rate\nThis is the key rate used in monetary policy to meet the Treasury’s inﬂation target.\nThis rate is set for the Bank’s own operati ons in the market, such as its short-term\nlending activities. Changes to this rate affect the rates set by the commercial banks\nfor their savers and borrowers. In turn, this rate will affect spending and output in\nthe economy, and eventually costs and prices. An increase in this rate would imply\nan attempt to curb inﬂation and slow growth, while a decrease in this rate would be\naimed at stimulating growth and expansion.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe goal of open market operations is to implement changes in the bank repo rate,\nwhile assuring adequate liquidity in the market and continued stability in the banking\nsystem. This is reﬂective of the three main objectives of the BoE: maintaining the\nintegrity and value of the currency, maintaining the stability of the ﬁnancial system,\nand seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the United Kingdom’s ﬁnancial services.\nTo ensure liquidity, the Bank conducts daily open market operations to buy or sell\nshort-term government ﬁxed-income instruments. If this is not sufﬁcient to meet\nliquidity needs, the Bank would also conduct additional overnight operations.\nImportant Characteristics of the British Pound\n■GBPUSD is very liquid . The GBPUSD is one of the most liquid currencies in the\nworld, with 6% of all currency trading involving the British pound as either\nthe base or counter currency. It is also one of the three most liquid currencies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)227alongside EURUSD and USDJPY. One of the reasons for the currency’s liquidity\nis the country’s highly developed capital markets. Many foreign investors seeking\nopportunities other than the United States have sent their funds to the United\nKingdom for investment. In order to create these transactions, foreigners will\nneed to sell their local currency and buy British pounds.\n■GBP has three names . The UK’s currency has three names: the British pound,\nsterling, and cable. All of these are used interchangeably.\n■GBP is laden with speculators . At the time of publication, the British pound has one\nof the highest interest rates among the developed nations. Although Australia\nand New Zealand have higher interest rates, their ﬁnancial markets are not as\ndeveloped as that of the United Kingdom. As a result, many investors who already\nhave positions or are interested in initiating new carry trades positions frequently\nuse the GBP as the lending currency and will go long the pound against currencies\nsuch as the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. A carry trade involves\nbuying or lending a currency with a higher interest and selling or borrowing a\ncurrency with a lower interest rate. In recent years, carry trades have increased in\npopularity, which helped spur demand for the British pound. However, should the\ninterest rate yield differential bet ween the pound and other currencies narrow,\nan exodus of carry traders will increase volatility in the British pound.\n■Interest rate differentials between Gilt s and foreign bonds ar e closely followed . Interest rate\ndifferentials between UK Gilts—U.S. Tr easuries and UK Gilts and German Bunds\nare widely watched by FX market participants. Gilts versus Treasuries can be a\nbarometer of GBPUSD ﬂows, while Gilts versus Bunds can be used as a barometer\nfor EURGBP ﬂows. More speciﬁcally, these interest rate differentials indicate how\nmuch premium yield UK ﬁxed-income assets are offering over U.S. and European\n(German Bunds are usually used as a barometer for European yield) ﬁxed-income\nassets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders with indications of potential\ncapital ﬂow or currency movements, as global investors are always shifting their\ncapital in search of the assets with the highest yields. The United Kingdom can\nprovide these yields with the safety of having the same credit stability as the United\nStates.\n■Euro sterling futures can give indications for interest rate movements .S i n c et h eU K\ninterest rate or bank repo rate is the primary tool used in monetary policy, it is\nimportant to keep abreast of potential changes to the interest rate. Comments\nfrom government ofﬁcials is one way to gauge biases for potential rate changes,\nbut the Bank of England is one of the only central banks that requires members\nof the Monetary Policy Committee to publish their speciﬁc voting records.\nThis personal accountability indicates that comments by individual committee\nmembers represent their own opinions and not that of the BoE. Therefore,\nit is necessary to look for other indication of potential BoE rate movements.\nThree-month euro sterling futures reﬂect market expectations on euro sterling\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)228\nFIGURE 28.1 GBPUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\ninterest rates three months into the future. These contracts are also useful in\npredicting UK interest rate changes, which will ultimately affect the ﬂuctuations\nof the GBPUSD. Figure 28.1 illustrates 10 year performance of GBP-USD.\n■Comments on euro by UK politicians will impact the euro . Any speeches, remarks\n(especially from the Prime Minister or Treasury Chancellor), or polls in regards\nto the euro will impact currency trade. Indication of adoption of the euro tends\nto put downward pressure on GBP, while further opposition to euro entry will\ntypically boost the GBP. Reason being that in order for the GBP to come in line\nwith the euro, interest rates would have to decline and monetary policy would\nhave to be subjected to a foreign entity. A decrease in the interest rate would\ninduce carry trade investors to close their positions or sell pounds. The GBPUSD\nwould also decline because of the uncertainties involved with Euro adoption. The\nUK economy is performing very well under the direction of its current monetary\nauthority. The EMU is currently encountering many difﬁculties with member\ncountries breaching EMU criteria. With one monetary authority dictating 19\ncountries (plus UK would be 20), the EMU has yet to prove that they have\ndeveloped a monetary policy suitable for all member states.\n■GBP has positive correlation with energy prices . The UK houses some of the largest\nenergy companies in the world, including British Petroleum. Energy production\nrepresents 10% of GDP. As a result, the British pound tends to have a positive\ncorrelation with energy prices. Speciﬁcally, since many members of the EU\nimport oil from the United Kingdom, as oil prices increase, they will, in turn,\nhave to buy more pounds to fund their energy purchases. In addition, rises in the\nprice of oil will also beneﬁt the earnings of the nations’ energy exporters.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)229■GBP crosses . Although the GBP/USD is a more liquid currency than EURGBP,\nEURGBP is typically the leading gauge for GBP strength. The GBPUSD currency\npair tends to be more sensitive to U.S. developments, while EURGBP is a\nmore pure fundamental pound trade since Europe is Britain’s primary trade\nand investment partner. However, both currencies are naturally interdependent,\nwhich means movements in the EURGBP can affect movements in the GBPUSD.\nThe reverse is also true—that is, movements in GBPUSD will also affect trading\nin EURGBP. Therefore, it is important for pound traders to be consciously aware\nof the trading behavior of both currency pairs. The EURGBP rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURUSD divided by the GBPUSD rate. Small differences in\nthese rates are often exploited by market participants and quickly eliminated.\n■Important Economic Indicators\nfor the United Kingdom\nAll of the following indicators are important for the United Kingdom. However,\nsince the United Kingdom is primarily a service-oriented economy, it is particularly\nimportant to pay attention to service sector data.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the manufacturing,\nservice, and construction sectors. These numbers are extremely market moving\nbecause they provide the most up-to-date information on how each of the economies\nis performing in the current month and not how the economies performed\nthe previous month, like many other reports. However since the reports are for the\ncurrent period, they are usually subject to revisions, so the euro will move on the\npreliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents expansion, and a\nreading below 50 represents contraction. For the United Kingdom, the PMI services\nindex is the most important, along with the composite index, which aggregates how\nthe manufacturing and service sector are performing.\nEmployment Situation\nThe employment report is a monthly survey of the labor market conducted by\nthe Ofﬁce of National Statistics. The obj ectives of the survey are to divide the\nworking-age population into three separate classiﬁcations (employed, unemployed,\nand not in the labor force), and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of\nthese categories. Data from the survey provide market participants with information\non major labor market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors,\nhours worked, labor force participation, and unemployment rates. The timeliness\nof the survey makes it a closely watched s tatistic by the currency market as it is a\ngood barometer of the strength of the UK economy and an important input into\nmonetary policy.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)230Retail Sales\nThe key to growth is consumer spending, and for this reason, the retail sales report\nis also extremely market moving. The Retail Sales Index measures the total goods\nsold by a sampling of retail stores over the course of a month. This index is used as\na gauge of consumer consumption and consumer conﬁdence. While retail sales can\nbe quite volatile due to seasonality, it is one of the most important indicators on the\nhealth of the economy, along with a key input for GDP.\nConsumer or Retail Price Index\nCPI or RPI is a measure of the change in prices of a basket of consumer goods. The\nmarkets however focus on the underlying RPI or RPI-X, which excludes mortgage\ninterest payments. The RPI-X is closely watc hed as the treasury sets inﬂation targets\nfor the BoE, currently deﬁned as 2.5% annual growth in RPI-X.\nGDP\nGDP is a quarterly report conducted by the Bureau of Statistics. GDP is a measure\nof the total production and consumption of goods and services in the UK. GDP\nis measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses, government, and\nnet foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert output measured\nat current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used to gauge where in\nthe business cycle the United Kingdom ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is perceived\nas inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or weak\ngrowth.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures the change in output in the United\nKingdom of manufacturing; mining and quarrying; and electricity, gas, and water\nsupply. Output refers to the physical quantity of items produced, unlike sales value,\nwhich combines quantity and price. The index covers the production of goods and\npower for domestic sales in the United Kingdom and for export. Because IP is\nresponsible for close to a quarter of gross domestic product, IP is widely watched as\nit can provide good insight into the current state of the economy.\nUK Housing Starts\nHousing starts measures the number of residential building construction projects\nthat have begun during any particular month. This is important for the United\nKingdom as the housing market is the primary industry that sustains the economy.\n231CHAPTER 29\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nSwiss Franc (CHF)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nSwitzerland is the twentieth largest economy in the world, with a GDP valued at\nover US$685 billion as of 2014. Although the economy is relatively small, it is one of\nthe wealthiest in the world on a GDP per capita basis. The country is prosperous and\ntechnologically advanced with economic and political stability that rivals many larger\neconomies. The country’s prosperity stems primarily from technological expertise\nin manufacturing, tourism, and banking. More speciﬁcally, Switzerland is known for\ntheir chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, machinery, precision instruments,\nwatches, and a ﬁnancial system historically known for protecting the conﬁdentiality\nof its investors. This coupled with the country’s lengthy history of political neutrality\nearned Switzerland the Swiss franc safe haven status and as a direct result of that,\nit is the one world’s most popular destinations for offshore capital. Even when the\ncentral bank introduced a temporary 1.20 EURCHF peg and lowered interest rates\nto negative levels, Switzerland stil l managed to attract safe haven ﬂows.\nIt is estimated that Switzerland holds over US$2 trillion in offshore assets as of\n2014 and attracts over 35% of the world’s private wealth management business.\nA large and highly advanced banking and insurance industry has developed to support\nthis demand, and the sector employs over 50% of the population and comprises over\n70% of total GDP. Since Switzerland’s ﬁnancial industry thrives on its safe haven\nstatus and renowned conﬁdentiality, capital ﬂows tend to drive the economy during\ntimes of global risk aversion, while trade ﬂows drive the economy in a risk-seeking\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)232environment. Trade ﬂows are extremely important, with nearly two thirds of all\ntrade conducted with Europe. With this in mind, Switzerland’s most important\ntrading partners a re the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Germany\n2. India\n3. United States\n4. Hong Kong\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Italy\n3. United States\n4. France\n5. China\nTraditionally, Switzerland has a strong trade and current account surplus that\nlends support to the currency. Most of the surplus can be attributed to the large\namount of foreign direct investment into the country, in seek of safety of capital,\ndespite the low to negative yields offered by Switzerland.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Swiss\nNational Bank\nMonetary policy in Switzerland is determined by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). They\nare a completely independent authority with a three-person committee responsible\nfor determining monetary policy. This committee consists of a chairman, a vice\nchairman, and one other (member) who constitute the Governing Board of the\nSNB. Due to the small size of the committee, all decisions are based on a consensus\nvote. The Board reviews monetary policy at least once a quarter, but decisions on\nmonetary policy can be made and announced at any point in time. Unlike most other\ncentral banks, the SNB does not set one ofﬁcial interest rate target, but instead sets\na target range for their three-month Swiss Libor rate.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nIn December of 1999, the SNB shifted from focusing on monetary targets (M3) to an\ninﬂation target of less than 2% inﬂation per year. This measure is taken based on the\nnational consumer price index. Monetary targets still remain important indicators\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)233and are closely watched by the central bank, because they provide information on\nthe long-term inﬂation. This new inﬂation focus also increases the central bank’s\ntransparency. In their mandate, they have clearly stated, ‘‘Should inﬂation exceed\n2% in the medium term, the National Bank will tend to tighten its monetary stance.’’\nIf there is danger of deﬂation, the National Bank would loosen monetary policy. The\nSNB also closely monitors exchange rates, as excessive strength in the Swiss franc\ncan cause inﬂationary conditions. This is especially true in environments of global\nrisk aversion, as capital ﬂows into Switzerland increases signiﬁcantly during those\ntimes. As a result, the SNB typically favors a weak franc, and is not hesitant to use\nintervention as liquidity tool. SNB ofﬁcials intervene in the franc using a variety of\nmethods including verbal remarks on liquidity, money supply, and the currency.\nTheir Tools\nThe most commonly used tools by the SNB to implement monetary policy include\nthe following.\nTarget Interest Rate Range\nTraditionally, the SNB implements monetary policy by setting a target range for\ntheir three-month interest rate known as the Swiss Franc Libor rate. According\nto the SNB, ‘‘The Libor is a reference inte rest rate in the interbank market for\nunsecured loans.’’ It is a trimmed mean of the rates charged by 12 leading banks and\nis published daily by the British Bankers’ Association. The National Bank publishes\nits target range regularly. As a rule, this range extends over 1 percentage point,\nand the SNB generally aims to keep the Libor in the middle of the range. The SNB\nundertakes quarterly economic and monetary assessments at which it reviews its\nmonetary policy. If circumstances so require, it will also adjust the Libor target\nrange in between these quarterly assessments. It sets out the reasons for its decisions\nin press releases.\nOpen Market Operations\nRepo transactions are the SNB’s major monetary policy instrument. A repo\ntransaction involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider\n(lender), while agreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity\nat a later date. This structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker\nmust pay the cash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short\nmaturities ranging from one day to a few weeks. The SNB uses these repo transactions\nto manipulate undesirable moves in the three-month Libor rate. To prevent increases\nin the three-month Libor rate above the SNB’s target, the bank would supply the\ncommercial banks with additional liquidity through repo transactions at lower repo\nrates, and in essence create additional liquidity. Conversely, the SNB can reduce\nliquidity or induce increases in the three-month Libor rate by increasing repo rates.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)234In addition to the quarterly monetary policy decision, the SNB publishes a\nQuarterly Bulletin with a detailed assessment of the current state of the economy\nand a review of monetary policy. A Monthly Bulletin is also published containing a\nshort review of economic developments. These reports are important to watch, as\nthey may contain information on changes in the SNB’s assessment of economy and\nguidance on monetary policy.\n1.20 EUR/CHF Peg Implementation and Abandonment\nFew would have expected that one of the seminal developments in the forex market\nwas the Swiss National Bank’s decision to implement and later abandon its 1.20\nEURCHF peg. This decision transformed the foreign exchange industry, bankrupted\nmany brokers, and led to tighter regulations across the globe. Faced with a high level\nof uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued currency and deﬂation risks\nin 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At\nthe time, it pledged to sell francs in an unlimited quantity to maintain the peg. The\ngoal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping the gain in the franc. However,\nin January 2015, the prospect of quantitative easing from the European Central\nBank pushed the SNB to abandon the peg. It also accumulated signiﬁcant foreign\nexchange reserves that irritated critics, but more importantly, the franc became less\novervalued through the years, giving the SNB fewer reasons to maintain the peg.\nSNB’s decision was a complete surprise, and caused a 30% drop in EURCHF in\na single day. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\n■Important Characteristics of the Swiss Franc\n■Safe haven status . This is perhaps the most unique characteristic of the Swiss franc.\nSwitzerland’s safe haven status is continually stressed because this and the secrecy\nof the banking system are the key advantages of Switzerland. The Swiss franc\nmoves primarily on external events rather than domestic economic conditions.\nThat is, as mentioned earlier, due to its political neutrality, the franc is considered\nthe world’s premier safe haven currency. Therefore, in times of global instability\nand/or uncertainty, investors tend to be more concerned with capital retention\nthan appreciation. At such times, funds will ﬂow into Switzerland, which would\ncause the Swiss franc to appreciate regardless of whether growth conditions are\nfavorable.\n■Swiss franc is closely correlated with gold . Switzerland is the world’s third largest\nofﬁcial holder of gold. In the past, a Swiss constitutional mandate required the\ncurrency to be backed 40% with gold reserves. The mandate is now removed\nbut the positive correlation between the Swiss franc and gold remains because\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)235the relationship has been engrained into the minds of forex traders; therefore,\nboth gold and the Swiss franc are perceived as safe haven instruments. Before the\nSNB abandoned the EURCHF 1.20, Swiss franc had an 80% positive correlation\nwith gold. These days, the correlation is still there but in a smaller magnitude.\nGenerally speaking, if the price of gold appreciates, the Swiss franc has a high\nlikelihood of rising in value. In addition, since gold is also viewed as the ultimate\nsafe haven form of money, both gold and the Swiss franc beneﬁt during periods\nof global economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n■Carry trades effects . With one of the lowest interest rates in the industrialized world,\nover the past few years, the Swiss franc has become one of the most popular\nfunding currencies for carry trades. As mentioned in this book, the popularity of\ncarry trades has increased signiﬁcantly over the past two decades, as investors are\nactively seeking high yield. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency\nwith a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest\nrate. With CHF having one of the lowest interest rates of all industrialized\ncountries, it is one of the primary currencies sold or borrowed in carry trades.\nThis results in the need to sell CHF against a higher yielding currency. Carry\ntrades are typically done in cross-currencies such as GBPCHF or AUDCHF, but\nthese trades can impact both EURCHF and USDCHF. The unwinding of carry\ntrades involves the need for investors to buy back the Swiss franc.\n■Interest rate differentials between euro Swiss futures and foreign interest rate futures are\nclosely followed . One of the favorite indicators of professional Swiss franc traders\nis the interest rate differential bet ween three-month euro Swiss futures and\neurodollar futures. These differentials can provide guidance on potential money\nﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield U.S. ﬁxed-income assets are\noffering over Swiss ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides\ntraders with indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always\nlooking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry\ntraders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate\ndifferentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Potential changes in banking regulations . Over the past few years members of the\nEuropean Union have been exerting signiﬁcant pressure on Switzerland to relax\nthe conﬁdentiality of their banking system and to increase transparency of their\ncustomers’ accounts. The European Union is pressing this issue because of its\nactive measures to persecute EU tax evaders. This should be a concern for many\nyears to come. However, this is a difﬁcult decision for Switzerland to make because\nthe conﬁdentiality of their customers’ accounts represents the core strength of\ntheir banking system. The EU has threatened to impose severe sanctions on\nSwitzerland if they do not comply with their proposed measures. Both countries\nare currently working to negotiate an equitable resolution. Any news or talk of\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)236changing banking regulations will impact both Switzerland’s economy and the\nSwiss franc.\n■Mergers and acquisition activity . Switzerland’s primary industry is banking and\nﬁnance. In this industry, merger and acquisition activities (M&A) are very\ncommon, especially as consolidation continues in the overall industry. As a result,\nthese M&A activities can have signiﬁcant impact on the Swiss franc. If foreign\nﬁrms purchase Swiss banks or insurance companies, they will need to buy Swiss\nfrancs and in turn, sell their local currency. If Swiss banks purchase foreign ﬁrms,\nthey would need to sell Swiss francs and buy the foreign currency. Either way,\nit is important for Swiss franc traders to frequently watch for notices on M&A\nactivity involving Swiss ﬁrms.\n■Trading behavior, cross currency characteristics . The EURCHF is the most commonly\ntraded currency for traders who want to participate in CHF movements. USDCHF\nis less frequently traded because of its greater illiquidity and volatility. However,\nday traders may tend to favor USDCHF over EURCHF because of its volatile\nmovements. In actuality, the USDCHF is a synthetic currency derived from\nEURUSD and EURCHF because more tra nsactions are done between the euro\nand Swiss franc. Market makers or professional traders tend to use those pairs as\nleading indicators for trading USDCHF or to price the current USDCHF level\nwhen the currency pair is illiquid. Theoretically, the USDCHF rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURCHF rate divided by EURUSD. Only during times of\nunusual circumstances, such as the Iraq War, September 11, or the EURCHF peg,\nwill USDCHF develop a market of its own. Any small differences in these rates\nare quickly exploited by market participants. Figure 29.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of EUR-CHF.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Switzerland\nEconomic data from Switzerland tends to have limited impact on the currency, but\nthese are the most important pieces of Swiss data.\nKoF Leading Indicators\nThe KoF leading indicators report is released by the Swiss Institute for Business\nCycle Research. This index is generally used to gauge the future health of the\nSwiss economy. It contains six components: (1) change in manufacturers’ orders;\n(2) the expected purchase plans of manufacturers over the next three months; (3)\nthe judgment of stocks in wholesale business; (4) consumer perception of their\nﬁnancial conditions; (5) backlog in the construction sector; and (6) orders backlog\nfor manufacturers.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)\nk\nk237\nk\nk\nFIGURE 29.1 EURCHF 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)238Consumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index is calculated monthly, on the basis of retail prices paid in\nSwitzerland. In accordance with prevalent international practice, the commodities\ncovered are distinguished according to the consumption concept, which includes in\nthe calculation of the CPI of those goods and services that are part of the private\nconsumption aggregate according to the National Accounts. The basket of goods does\nnot include transfer expenditure such as direct taxation, social insurance contributions,\nand health insurance premiums. The index is a key measure of inﬂation.\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services in\nthe Switzerland. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Switzerland ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nBalance of Payments\nBalance of payments is the collective term for the accounts of Swiss transactions\nwith the rest of the world. The current account is the balance of trade plus services\nportion. BoP is an important indicator for Swiss traders, as Switzerland has always\nkept a strong current account balance. Any changes to the current account, positive\nor negative, could see substantial ﬂows.\nProduction Index (Industrial Production)\nThe production index is a quarterly measure of the change in the volume of industrial\nproduction (or physical output by producers).\nRetail Sales\nSwitzerland’s retail sales report is released on a monthly basis 40 days after the\nreference month. The report is an important indicator of consumer spending habits\nand is not seasonally adjusted.\n239CHAPTER 30\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nJapanese Yen (JPY)\n■Economic Overview\nJapan is the third largest economy in the world with GDP valued at over US$4.6\ntrillion in 2014 (behind the United States and China). If we count the European\nUnion as a whole, it would be considered the fourth largest economy. Japan is one of\nthe world’s largest exporters and is responsible for over US$690 billion in exports\nper year. Manufacturing and exports of products such as electronics and cars are the\nsignature drivers of the economy, accounting for nearly 17% of GDP. As a result,\nJapanese growth is extremely sensitive to the value of the currency. For many years,\nJapan has maintained a trade surplus, but the earthquake followed by tsunami in\n2011 turned the country into a net oil importer and created a long period of trade\nimbalances, where oil imports exceeded exports in value. This began to change in\nearly 2015, when a weakening yen and falling oil prices helped to turn around trade\nactivity, returning Japan to a surplus nation. Having a trade surplus means that there\nwill be inherent demand for the Japanese yen even when interest rates are low\nand there are structural deﬁciencies. Japan’s most important trade partners are the\nUnited States and China:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. South Korea\n4. Taiwan\n5.

Saudi Arabia\n■Abenomics\nIn the 1980s, Japan’s capital market was one of the most attractive markets for\ninternational investors seeking investment opportunities in Asia. Japan had the most\ndeveloped capital markets in the region, and its banking system was considered to\nbe the one of the strongest in the world. At the time, the country was experiencing\nabove-trend economic growth and near zero inﬂation. This resulted in rapid\ngrowth expectations, boosted asset prices, and rapid credit expansion, leading to the\ndevelopment of an a sset bubble. Between 1990 and 1997, the asset bubble collapsed,\ninducing a US$10 trillion decline in asset prices, with the fall in real estate values\naccounting for nearly 65% of the total decline, nearly two years of national output.\nThis fall in asset prices sparked the banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early\n1990s and developed into a full-blown systemic crisis in 1997 following the failure\nof a number of high-proﬁle ﬁnancial institutions. Many of these banks and ﬁnancial\ninstitutions extended loans to builders and real estate developers at the height of\nthe asset bubble in the 1980s, with land as collateral. A number of these developers\ndefaulted after the asset bubble collapse, leaving the country’s banks saddled with\nbad debt and collateral worth sometimes 60% to 80% less than when the loans\nwere taken out. Due to the large size of these banking institutions and their role in\ncorporate funding, the crisis had profound effects on Japan and the global economy.\nEnormous bad debts, falling stock prices, and a collapsing real estate sector crippled\nJapan’s economy for more than two decades.\nIt was not until the rollout of Abenomics that the economy began to turn around.\nWhen Shinzo Abe became prime minister for the second time in 2012, he rolled out\na three-pronged plan to stimulate growth and pull the economy out of stagnation\nthrough monetary policy, ﬁscal policy, and economic growth strategies. This was\nknown as Abenomics . In the ﬁrst few weeks of the pr ogram, Abe announced a massive\nstimulus package that involved signiﬁcant government spending and a strong dose\nof quantitative easing. The effects were almost immediate, with the Japanese yen\nfalling signiﬁcantly across the board. Not soon after, the unemployment rate started\nto fall and growth slowly returned.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)241■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers\nMonetary policy in Japan is determined by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). In 1998, the\nJapanese government passed laws giving the BoJ operational independence from the\nMinistry of Finance (MoF) and complete control over monetary policy. However,\ndespite the government’s attempts to decen tralize decision making, the MoF still\nremains in charge of foreign exchange policy. The BoJ is responsible for executing\nall ofﬁcial Japanese foreign exchange transactions at the direction of the MoF. The\nBank of Japan’s Policy Board consists of the BoJ governor, two deputy governors,\nand six other members. Monetary policy meetings are held twice a month, with\nbrieﬁngs and press releases provided immediately. The BoJ also publishes a Monthly\nReport issued by the Policy Board, and a Monthly Economic Report . These reports\nare important to watch for changes in BoJ sentiment and signals of new monetary\nor ﬁscal policy measures, as the government is constantly trying to develop fresh\ninitiatives to stimulate growth.\nThe MoF and the BoJ are very important institutions, and they both can\ninﬂuence currency movements. Since the MoF is the director of foreign exchange\ninterventions, it is important to watch and keep abreast of the comments made\nfrom MoF ofﬁcials. Being an export driven economy, the government tends to favor\na weaker currency. So if the Japanese yen appreciates signiﬁcantly or too rapidly\nagainst the dollar, members of the BoJ and MoF will become increasingly vocal about\ntheir concerns or disapproval in regards to its current level or recent movements.\nThese comments can affect how the yen moves, but if government ofﬁcials ﬂood the\nmarket with comments and there is no follow-up action, the market would start\nto become immune to these concerns. However, the MoF and BoJ have a lengthy\nhistory of interventions in the currency markets to manipulate the value of the yen\nvalue in Japan’s best interests, so their comments cannot be completely ignored.\nThe most popular tool that the BoJ uses to control monetary policy is open\nmarket operations.\nOpen Market Operations\nThese activities are focused on controlling th e uncollateralized overnight call rate.\nThe Bank of Japan has maintained a zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) for some time\nnow, which means that the Bank of Japan cannot lower this rate further to stimulate\ngrowth, consumption, or liquidity. Therefore, in order to maintain zero interest\nrates, the BoJ has to manipulate liquidity through open market operations, targeting\nzero interest on the overnight call rate. It manipulates liquidity by the outright\nbuying or selling of bills, repos, or Japanese government bonds. A repo transaction\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)242involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider (lender), while\nagreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date.\nThis structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the\ncash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities,\nranging from one day to a few weeks.\nImportant Characteristics of the JPY\n■Proxy for Asian strength/weakness . Japan tends to be seen as a proxy for broad Asian\nstrength because the country has the largest GDP in Asia outside of China. With\nthe most developed capital markets, Japan was once the primary destination for\nall investors who wanted access into the region. Japan also conducts a signiﬁcant\namount of trade with its Asian partners. As a result, economic problems or\npolitical instability in Japan tend to spill over into the other Asian countries.\nHowever, this spillover is not one-sided. Economic or political problems in\nother Asian economies, particularly China, can also have dramatic impacts on\nthe Japanese economy and in turn movements in the Japanese yen. For example,\nNorth Korean political instability poses a great risk to Japan and the Japanese yen\ndue to the country’s geographic proximity.\n■Bank of Japan intervention practices . The BoJ and MoF are active participants in\nthe foreign exchange markets. That is, t hey have a lengthy history of entering\nthe FX markets if they are d issatisﬁed with the value of the Japanese yen. While\nthey have not intervened since 2011, they won’t be reluctant to do so if the\ncurrency strengthens signiﬁcantly. As Japan is a very political economy, with\nclose ties between government ofﬁcials and principals of large private institutions,\nthe MoF can have a very narrow segment in mind when it decides to intervene\nin the currency. Since the BoJ is such an active participant, it is very in tune\nwith the market movements and its participants. Periodically, the BoJ receives\ninformation on large hedge fund positions from banks and likes to intervene when\nspeculators are on the other side of the market, allowing them to get the most\n‘‘bang for the bucks.’’ The MoF and BoJ always considers three main factors\nbefore intervention:\n1.Amount of appreciation/depreciation in JPY —Intervention has historically\noccurred when the yen moves by 7 or more yen in less than 6 weeks. Using\nthe USDJPY as a barometer, 7 yen would be equivalent to 700 pips, which\nwould represent a move from 120.00 to 127.00.\n2.Current USDJPY rate —Historically, only 11% of all BoJ interventions that\nwere conducted to counter a strong JPY occurred above the 115 level.\n3.Speculative positions— In order to maximize the impact of intervention, the\nBoJ and MoF prefer to intervene when market participants hold massive\npositions in the opposing direction because the ﬂow of stops will exacerbate\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)243the reversal in the currency pair. The CFTC provides a weekly report on\nexisting speculative positions that can be found at www.cftc.gov.\n■JPY movements are sensitive to time . The Japanese yen can be particularly active\ntowards the end of Japan’s ﬁscal year (March 31), as exporters repatriate their\ndollar denominated assets to window dress their balance sheets. This is particularly\nimportant for Japanese banks because they need to rebuild their balance sheets\nto meet FSA guidelines that require the banks to mark to market their security\nholdings. In anticipation of the need for repatriation-related purchases, Japanese\nyen speculators frequently bid the yen higher in attempt to take advantage of this\nincreased inﬂow. As a result, following ﬁscal year end, the Japanese yen tends to\nhave a bias toward depreciation as speculators close their positions.\nAside from the ﬁscal year end, time is also a factor on a day-to-day basis.\nUnlike traders in London or New York who typically have lunch at their trading\ndesk, Japanese traders tend to take hour-long lunches, leaving only a junior trader\nin the ofﬁce. On occasion, this can translate into additional volatility in the yen\nduring this period as the market becomes illiquid. In addition to this period, the\nJPY tends to move fairly orderly during Japanese and London hours, unless there\nare ofﬁcial comments or major surprises in economic data. During U.S. hours,\nhowever, the JPY tends to have higher volatility, as U.S. traders are actively\nengaging in dollar and yen positions.\n■Stocks and bonds have a positive correlation with USDJPY . The Nikkei has a positive\ncorrelation with USDJPY, which means that when the currency pair appreciating,\nequities are generally on the rise as well. For Japan, the currency typically leads\nequities because a weak yen is positive for the economy, but there can be times\nwhen equities lead currencies. The spread between U.S. 10-year Treasury and\nJGB yields is also very important for the currency. Typically, when the yield\nspread is on the rise, we see USDJPY move higher, and when the yield spread\ndeclines, it creates pressure on USDJPY. Figure 30.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of USDJPY.\n■Carry trade effects . The popularity of carry trades has increased in recent years, as\ninvestors are actively seeking high-yielding assets. With the Japanese yen having\nthe lowest interest rate of all industrialized countries, it is the primary currency\nsold or borrowed in carry trades. The most popular carry trade currencies\nincluded GBPJPY, AUDJPY, NZDJPY, and even USDJPY. Carry traders would\ngo short the Japanese yen against the higher yielding currencies. Unwinding of\ncarry trades as result of spread narrowing is typically beneﬁcial for the Japanese\nyen, as the reversal process involves purchasing the yen and buying back other\ncurrencies. Since there is so much demand to sell the yen for carry, in periods of\nrisk aversion, these trades can be unwound quickly creating a signiﬁcant rally in\nthe currency.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)244■Important Economic Indicators for Japan\nSince Japan is a manufacturing-oriented economy, manufacturing data tend to have\nthe most signiﬁcant impact on the yen. However, on a monthly basis, unless there is\na big surprise, Japanese data do not typically move the currency. The most inﬂuential\nevent risk is always the monetary policy announcement and trade balance. Aside\nfrom that, these are the numbers to watch.\nTankan Survey\nIf there is one piece of Japanese data to follow, it should be the quarterly Tankan\nReport. The Tankan is an economic survey of Japanese enterprises published four\ntimes a year. The survey includes more than 9,000 enterprises, which are divided\ninto four major groups: large, small, and medium-sized companies, as well as\nprincipal enterprises. The survey provides us with an overall impression of the\nbusiness climate in Japan and is widely watched and anticipated by foreign exchange\nmarket participants.\nBalance of Payments\nThe monthly balance of payments report provides investors with insight into Japan’s\ninternational economic transactions that include goods, services, investment income,\nand capital ﬂows. The current account side of BoJ can be used a good gauge of\ninternational trade. Figures are released on a monthly and semiannual basis.\nEmployment\nEmployment ﬁgures are reported on a monthly basis by the Management and\nCoordination Agency of Japan. The employment release measures the number of\njobs and unemployment rate for the country as a whole. The data are obtained\nthrough a statistical survey of the current labor force. This release is a closely\nwatched economic indicator because of its timeliness and its importance as a leading\nindicator of economic activity.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures trends in the output of Japanese\nmanufacturing, mining, and utilities companies. Output refers to the total quantity\nof items produced. The index covers the production of goods for domestic sales\nin Japan and for export. It excludes production in the agriculture, construction,\ntransportation, communication, trade, ﬁnance, and service industries; government\noutput; and imports. The IP index is then developed by weighting each component\naccording to its relative importance during this base period. Investors feel IP and\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)\nk\nk245\nk\nk\nFIGURE 30.1 USDJPY 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)246inventory accumulation have strong correlations with total output and can provide\nvaluable insight into the current state of the economy.\nGDP\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a broad measure of the total production and\nconsumption of goods and services measured over quarterly and yearly periods in\nJapan. GDP is measured by adding total expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. Preliminary reports\nare the most signiﬁcant for FX market participants.\n247CHAPTER 31\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nAustralian Dollar\n(AUD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nAustralia is the twelfth largest country in the world, with a gross domestic product\nof approximately US$1.5 trillion. In Asia, it ranks as the third largest economy\nin the region. On a relative basis, the economy is very small, only one-tenth\nthat of the United States and less than one-ﬁfth the size of China. However on a\nper capita basis, Australia ranks right up there with many industrialized Western\nEuropean countries. Australia has a service-oriented economy with close to 70%\nof GDP coming from industries such as ﬁnance, property, and business services.\nHowever, the country has a trade deﬁcit, with manufacturing dominating the\ncountry’s exporting activities. Rural and mineral exports account for over 60% of all\nmanufacturing exports and 12% of GDP. The economy is therefore highly sensitive\nto changes in commodity prices. As a country heavily dependent on exports, the\npace of growth of Australia’s largest trade partners is extremely important because\ndownturns or rapid growth abroad can impact import and export demand. Here’s a\nbreakdown of Australia’s most important trading partners:\nL a r g e s tE x p o r tM a r k e t s\n1. China\n2. Japan\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)2483. South Korea\n4. United States\n5. New Zealand\nLargest Import Sources\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. Japan\n4. Singapore\n5. Germany\nAs you can see, Australia’s number one trading partner is China. In fact, Chinese\ndemand represents a third of the country’s trade activity. In terms of products, the\nChinese are major importers of Australian iron ore, coal, natural gas, and gold.\nAsia Pac is extremely important to Australia, as more than 70% of its exports are\ndestined for countries within the region. This makes Australia’s economy highly\nsensitive to the performance of countries in the Asian Paciﬁc region. Hiccups in\nChina’s economy can have a signiﬁcant impact on Australia, not only in terms of\nexporting activities but also on housing market activity. At the same time, growth in\nChina is positive for Australia’s economy. During the global ﬁnancial crisis, exports\nto China helped shelter Australia from a major downturn. The relationship between\nChina and Australia is known as Sino-Australian relations. China has recently taken\nsteps to produce its own resources, and if this trend continues, it could dramatically\nchange the landscape of Australia’s economy.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is the central bank of Australia. The monetary\npolicy committee within the central bank consists of the governor (chairman), the\ndeputy governor (vice chairman), secretary to the treasurer, and six independent\nmembers appointed by the government. Changes to monetary policy are made on\nconsensus within the committee.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nThe RBA’s charter states t hat the mandate of the Reserve Bank Board is to focus\nmonetary and banking policy on ensuring:\n1. The stability of the currency of Australia;\n2. The maintenance of full employment in Australia; and\n3. The economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)249In order to achieve these objectives, the government has set an informal consumer\nprice inﬂation target of 2% to 3% per year. The RBA believes that the key to long-\nterm sustainable growth in the economy is to control inﬂation, which would preserve\nthe value of money. In addition, an inﬂation target provides a discipline for monetary\npolicy making and guidelines for private-sector inﬂation expectations. This also\nincreases the transparency of the banks’ activities. Should inﬂation or inﬂation\nexpectations exceed the 2% to 3% target, traders should know that it would raise\nred ﬂags at the RBA and prompt the central bank to favor a tighter monetary policy\nor, in the other words, further rate hikes.\nMonetary policy decisions involve setting the interest rate on overnight loans\nin the money market. Other interest rates in the economy are inﬂuenced by this\ninterest rate to varying degrees, so that the behavior of borrowers and lenders in\nthe ﬁnancial markets is affected by monetary policy (though not only by monetary\npolicy). Through these channels, monetary policy affects the economy in pursuit of\nthe goals just outlined.\nCash Rate\nThe cash rate is the RBA’s target rate for open market operations and is the rate\ncharged on overnight loans between ﬁnancial intermediaries. This means the cash\nrate should have a close relationship with the prevailing money market interest rates.\nChanges in monetary policy directly affect the interest rate structure of the ﬁnancial\nsystem. They also affect sentiment in a currency. Figure 31.1 graphs the AUDUSD\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.01. 2\n1. 1\n1. 0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n6/4/10 6/4/11 6/4/12AUDUSD vs. AU-US 10 Year Spread\n6/4/13 6/4/14 6/4/15\nAU-US Spread AUDUSD\nFIGURE 31.1 AUDUSD vs. 10-Year Yield Spread\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)250against the interest rate differential between Australia and the United States between\n2010 and 2015. There is clearly a positive c orrelation between the 10-year yield\nspread and the currency. Between June 2014 and June 2015, for example, the yield\nspread dropped from 1.5% to 0.5%, and thi s coincided with a drop in the AUDUSD\nfrom 95 to 76 cents.\nMaintaining the Cash Rate: Open Market Operations\nThe focus of daily open market operations is to keep the cash rate close to the target,\nby managing money market liquidity provided to commercial banks. If the Reserve\nBank wishes to decrease the cash rate, it would increase supply of short-dated\nrepurchase agreements at a lower interest rate than the prevailing cash rate, which\nwould in essence decrease the cash rate. If the Reserve Bank wishes to increase\nthe cash rate, it would decrease supply of short-dated repurchase agreements,\nwhich would increase the cash rate. A repurchase agreement involves a cash taker\n(commercial bank) selling securities to a cash provider (RBA), while agreeing to\nrepurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date. This structure\nis similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the cash provider\ninterest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities, ranging from\none day to a few weeks.\nAustralia has had a ﬂoating exchange rate since 1983, and the Reserve Bank\nof Australia may undertake foreign exchange market operations when the market\nthreatens to become excessively volatile or when the exchange rate is clearly\ninconsistent with underlying economic fundamentals. The RBA monitors a trade-\nweighted index (TWI), as well as the cross-rate with the U.S. dollar. Intervention\noperations are invariably aimed at stabilizing market conditions rather than meeting\nexchange rate targets.\nMonetary Policy Meetings\nThe RBA meets every month (except for January), on the ﬁrst Tuesday of each\nmonth, to discuss potential changes in monetary policy. Following each meeting, the\nRBA issues a press release outlining justiﬁcations for its monetary policy changes.\nIf it leaves rates unchanged, no statement is published. The RBA also publishes a\nmonthly Reserve Bank Bulletin . The May and November issues of the Reserve Bank\nBulletin include the semiannual statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy. The\nFebruary, May, August, and November issues contain a Quarterly Report on the\nEconomy and Financial Markets. It is important to read these bulletins for signals on\npotential monetary policy changes.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)251Important Characteristics of the Australian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . Historically, the Australian dollar has had a very strongly\ncorrelation (approximately 80%) with commodity prices and, more speciﬁcally,\ngold and iron ore prices. The correlation stems from the fact that Australia is\nthe world’s second largest gold producer and the world’s largest producer of\niron ore. Therefore, the price of iron ore and gold is extremely important to\nAustralia’s economy. However, unless there is a sharp movement in gold or\niron ore prices, it generally takes time for the AUDUSD to adjust to changes in\nthe price of commodities. Generally speaking, if commodity prices are strong,\ninﬂationary fears start to appear, and the RBA would be inclined to raise rates to\ncurb inﬂation. However, this is a sensitive topic, as gold prices tend to increase\nin times of global economic or political uncertainty. If the RBA increases rates\nduring those conditions, it leaves Australia more vulnerable to spillover effects.\n■Carry trade effects . Australia has one of highest interest rates among the developed\ncountries. With a fairly liquid currency, the Australian dollar is one of the most\npopular currencies to use for carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or\nlending a currency with a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency\nwith a low interest rate. The popularity of the carry trade has contributed to the\n57% rise of the Australian dollar aga inst the U.S. dolla r between 2001 and 2005.\nWhile the carry trade suffered great ly in 2008, it came back strongly between\n2009 and 2011. During this time, many foreign investors were looking for high\nyield when equity investments offered minimal returns. However, carry trades\nonly last as long as the actual yield advantage remains. If global central banks\nincrease their interest rates and the positive interest rate differential between\nAustralia and other countries narro w, the AUDUSD could s uffer from an exodus\nof carry traders.\n■Drought effects . Since the majority of Australia’s exports are commodities, the\ncountry’s GDP is highly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage\nthe country’s farming activities. For example, 2002 was a particularly difﬁcult\nyear for Australia, because the country was experiencing a severe drought. The\ndrought took an extreme toll on Australia’s farming activities, with dry conditions\nhampering the economy throughout the twenty-ﬁrst century. This is important\nbecause agriculture accounts for 3% of the country’s GDP. The RBA estimates\nthat the ‘‘decline in farm production could directly reduce GDP growth by\naround 1 percentage point.’’ Aside from exporting activities, a drought also has\nindirect effects on other aspects of Australia’s economy. Industries that supply and\nservice agriculture, such as the wholesale and transport sectors, as well as retail\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)252operations in rural farming areas, may also be negatively affected by a drought.\nHowever, it is also important to note that the Australian economy has a history\nof recovering strongly after a drought. The 1982–1983 drought ﬁrst subtracted\nthen subsequently added around 1% to 1 1∕2% to GDP growth. The 1991–1995\ndrought reduced GDP by around 1∕2to3∕4percentage points in 1991–1992 and\n1994–1995, but the recovery boosted GDP by 3∕4percentage points.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of Australia\nand the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries should\nalso be closely watched by Australian dollar traders. These differentials can be\ngood indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much premium\nyield Australian dollar short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Australia\nGDP\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services\nin Australia. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Australia ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth generally coincides with a\nweak growth period.\nCPI\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a basket\nof goods and services, which account for a high proportion of expenditure by the\nCPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation, and\nhealth. This is an important indicator to watch, as it is a key input for monetary\npolicy decisions.\nBalance of Goods and Services\nThis number is a monthly measure of Australia’s international trade in goods and\nservices on a balance of payments basis. General merchandise imports and exports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)\nk\nk253\nk\nk\nFIGURE 31.2 AUDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)254are derived mainly from international trade statistics, which are based on Australian\nCustoms Service records. The current account is the balance of trade plus services.\nPrivate Consumption\nThis is a national accounts measure that reﬂects current expenditure by households\nand producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes purchases of\ndurable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure by persons\non the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by unincorporated\nenterprises. This number is important to watch, as private consumption or consumer\nconsumption is the foundation for resilience in the Australian economy.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average\nchanges in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI\ntracks changes in prices for nearly every goods-producing industry in the domestic\neconomy, including agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries,\nmanufacturing, and mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally\nadjusted ﬁnished goods PPI and how the index has reacted on an m/m, q/q, h/h\nand y/y basis. Australia’s PPI data are released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 31.2 illustrates the 10 year performance of AUDUSD.\n255CHAPTER 32\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nNew Zealand Dollar\n(NZD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nNew Zealand is a very small economy with GDP valued at approximately\nUS$183 billion in 2013. In fact, there are less people living in New Zealand\nthan in New York City. It was once one of the most regulated countries within\nthe OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), but over\nthe past two decades the country has been moving toward a more open, modern,\nand stable economy. With the passing of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994, the\ncountry is shifting from an agricultural farming community to one that seeks to\nbecome a leading knowledge-based economy with high skills, high employment,\nand high value-added production. This act sets legal standards that hold the govern-\nment formally responsible to the public for its ﬁscal performance. It also sets the\nframework for the country’s macroeconomic policies. The following are the ﬁve\nprinciples outlined under the Fiscal Responsibility Act:\n1. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; by achieving surpluses on the\noperating budget every year until such a level is reached.\n2. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; and the government must ensure\nthat expenditure is lower than revenue.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)2563. Sufﬁcient levels of Crown net worth must be achieved and maintained to guard\nagainst adverse future events.\n4. Reasonable taxation policies must be followed.\n5. Fiscal risks facing the government must be prudently managed.\nNew Zealand also has highly developed manufacturing and services sectors,\nwith the agricultural industry driving the bulk of the country’s exports. The\neconomy is strongly trade-oriented, with exports of goods and services representing\napproximately one third of GDP. Due to the small size of the economy and its\nsigniﬁcant trade activities, New Zealand is highly sensitive to global performance,\nespecially of its key Asian trading partners, Australia, China, United States, and Japan.\nTogether, Australia, China, and Japan represent 42% of New Zealand’s trading\nactivity. It is also extremely sensitive to exchange rate ﬂuctuations, particularly\nagainst the Australian dollar. The fo llowing lists are a breakdown of the New\nZealand’s most important trading partners:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Australia\n2. China\n3. European Union\n4. United States\n5. Japan\nLeading Import Sources\n1. European Union\n2. China\n3. Australia\n4. United States\n5. Japan\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Reserve\nBank of New Zealand\nMonetary policy in New Zealand is determined by the Reserve Bank (RBNZ).\nThe Monetary Policy Committee is an internal committee of bank executives who\nreview monetary policy on a weekly basis. Meetings to decide on changes to\nmonetary policy occur eight ti mes a year, or approximate ly every six weeks. Unlike\nmost other central banks, the decision for rate changes rests ultimately on the bank’s\ngovernor. The current policy target agreements set by the minister and the governor\nfocus on maintaining policy stability and avoiding unnecessary instability in output,\ninterest rates, and the exchange rate. Price stability refers to maintaining the annual\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)257CPI inﬂation at 1.5%. If the RBNZ does not meet this target, the government has\nthe ability to dismiss the governor of the RBNZ. This is rarely done, but this serves\nas a strong incentive for the RBNZ to meets its inﬂation target. The most common\ntools used by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy changes are the following.\nOfﬁcial Cash Rate (OCR)\nThe Ofﬁcial Cash Rate is the rate set by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy.\nThe Bank lends overnight cash at 25 basis points above the OCR rate and receives\ndeposits or pays interest at 25 basis points below this rate. By controlling the cost\nof liquidity for commercial banks, the RBNZ can inﬂuence the interest rates offered\nto individuals and corporations. This effectively creates a 50 basis point corridor\nthat bounds the interbank overnight rate. The idea is then that banks offering funds\nabove the upper bound will attract few takers, because funds can be borrowed for\na lower cost from the RBNZ. Also, banks offering rates below the lower bound\nwill also attract few takers, because they are offering lower yields than the RBNZ.\nThe ofﬁcial cash rate is reviewed and manipulated with the goal of maintaining\neconomic stability.\nObjectives for Fiscal Policy\nOpen market operations on the other hand are used to meet the cash target. The\ncash target is the targeted amount of reserves held by registered banks. The RBNZ\nprepares forecasts of daily ﬂuctuations on the cash target and will then use these\nforecasts to determine the amount of funds to inject or withdraw in order to meet\nthe cash target. The following government objectives provide a guideline for ﬁscal\nand monetary policy measures:\n■Expenses : Expenses will average around 35% of GDP over the horizon used to\ncalculate contributions toward future New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) costs.\nDuring the buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs, expenses plus contributions\nwill be around 35% of GDP. In the longer term, expenses less withdrawals to\nmeet NZS costs will be around 35% of GDP.\n■Revenue : Raise sufﬁcient revenue to meet the operating balance objective. A\nrobust, broad-based tax system that raises revenue in a fair and efﬁcient way.\n■Operating balance : Operating surplus on average over the economic cycle sufﬁcient\nto meet the requirements for contributions toward future NZS costs and ensure\nconsistency with the debt objective.\n■Debt: Gross debt below 30% of GDP on average over the economic cycle. Net\ndebt, which excludes the assets to meet future NZS costs, below 20% of GDP on\naverage over the economic cycle.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)258■Net worth : Increase net worth consistent with the operating balance objective.\nThis will be achieved through a buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs.\nSource: New Zealand Treasury\n■Important Characteristics of the New Zealand\nDollar\nStrong Correlation with AUD—Competition with Australia\nAustralia is New Zealand’s largest trading partner. This coupled with their geographic\nproximity and New Zealand’s high dependence on trade, creates strong ties between\nthe economies of the two countries. When the Australian economy is healthy and\nAustralian corporations increase their importing activities, New Zealand will be one\nof the ﬁrst to beneﬁt. When it is weak, New Zealand suffers but in recent years\nits sensitivity has diminished because of the country’s growing trade with China\nand other nations. Nonetheless, 22% of trade is still conducted with Australia,\nand this explains why there is a positive correlation between the two currencies.\nFigure 32.1 shows how closely AUDUS D and NZDUSD have moved between 2005\nand 2015.\nCommodity-Linked Currency\nNew Zealand is an export driven economy with commodities representing over\n40% of the country’s exports, and as a result the New Zealand dollar has a strong\ncorrelation with commodity prices, particularly dairy. Fonterra is one of the world’s\n1. 2\n1. 1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.4AUDUSD vs. NZDUSD\n6/30/05 6/30/06 6/30/07 6/30/08 6/30/09 6/30/10 6/30/11 6/30/12 6/30/13 6/30/140.5\nAUDUSD NZDUSD\nFIGURE 32.1 AUDUSD versus NZDUSD\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)259leading dairy producer and also largest company in New Zealand. Twice a month\nthe Global Dairy Trade will conduct an auction and if prices rise, it will be positive\nfor the New Zealand dollar. If prices fall, it will be negative for the currency\nbecause it can mean reduced payout and proﬁt for dairy producers. The correlation\nbetween Australian and New Zealand dollars also contributes to the NZD’s status as a\n‘‘commodity linked’’ currency. Therefore, the New Zealand dollar’s correlation with\ncommodity prices is not only limited to its own trade activities. Therefore, as com-\nmodity prices increase, the Australian economy beneﬁts, translating into increased\nactivity in all aspects of the country’s operations, including trade with New Zealand.\nCarry Trades\nOf the industrialized countries, New Zealand tends to maintain the highest interest\nrate as it needs to offer investors a higher yield to compensate for the risk of\ninvesting in a small economy. This yield advantage along with its secure credit rating\nhas made the New Zealand dollar one of the most popular currencies to purchase\nfor carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. The\npopularity of the carry trade has contributed to the rise of the New Zealand dollar in\nan environment where many global investors are looking for opportunities to earn\nhigh yield. However, this also makes the New Zealand dollar particularly sensitive\nto changes in interest rates. That is, when the United States begins increasing their\ninterest rates, while New Zealand stays on hold or reduces their interest rates, the\ncarry advantage of the New Zealand dollar would narrow. In such situations, the\nNew Zealand dollar could come under pressure as speculators reverse their carry\ntrade positions.\nInterest Rate Differentials\nInterest rate differentials between the cash rates of New Zealand and the short\nterm interest rate yields of other industrialized countries are closely watched by\nprofessional NZD traders. These differentials can be good indicators of potential\nmoney ﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield NZD short-term ﬁxed-\nincome assets are offering over foreign short-term ﬁxed income assets, or vice versa.\nThis differential provides traders with indications of potential currency movements,\nas investors are always looking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly\nimportant to carry traders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive\ninterest rate differentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\nPopulation Migration\nAs mentioned earlier, New Zealand has a very small population, less than half of\nNew York City. Therefore, changes in migration can have signiﬁcant effects on the\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)260economy. Between 2013 an d 2014, the population of New Zealand increased by\n78,800 people, which was the largest net migration in at least 90 years. Between\n2011 and 2012, for example, the population only grew by 26,400 people. Although\nthese absolute numbers appear small, it is fairly signiﬁcant for New Zealand because\nof the size of the population. In fact, this strong population migration into New\nZealand has contributed signiﬁcantly to the performance of the economy, because\nas the population increases, the demand for household goods increases, leading to\nan increase in overall consumer consumption.\nDrought Effects\nSince the bulk of New Zealand’s exports are commodities, the country’s GDP is\nhighly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage the country’s farming\nactivities. In 2013, droughts cost the country over $1.3 billion. In addition, droughts\nare also very frequent in Australia, New Zealand’s largest trading partner, and when\nthey occur it can have a negative impact on the New Zealand economy.\n■Important Economic Indicators for New Zealand\nNew Zealand does not release economic indicators often; however, when they do,\nthe following items are the most important:\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a quarterly measure of the total production and consumption of goods and\nservices in New Zealand. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households,\nbusinesses, government, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used\nto convert output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. This data are\nused to gauge where in the business cycle New Zealand ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often\nis perceived inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nConsumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a\n‘‘basket’’ of goods and services that account for a high proportion of expenditure by\nthe CPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation,\nand health. This is an important indicator to watch, as monetary policy changes are\nhighly inﬂuenced by this index as it is a measure of inﬂation.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)\nk\nk261\nk\nk\nFIGURE 32.2 NZDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)262Balance of Goods and Services\nNew Zealand’s Balance of Payments statements are records of the value of New\nZealand’s transactions in goods, services, income, and transfers with the rest of the\nworld, and the changes in New Zealand’s ﬁnancial claims on (assets), and liabilities\nto, the rest of the world. New Zealand’s International Investment Position statement\nshows, at a particular point in time, the stock of a country’s international ﬁnancial\nassets and international ﬁnancial liabilities.\nRetail Sales Ex Inﬂation\nCredit card spending numbers are released for New Zealand on a monthly basis but\nthe retail sales data is quarterly on an ex inﬂation basis. This measure tracks the\nresale of new and used goods to the public for personal or household consumption.\nIt is also an important input into GDP.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a m/m, q/q, h/h, and y/y basis. New\nZealand’s PPI data is released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 32.2 illustrates the 10-year performance of NZDUSD.\n263CHAPTER 33\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nCanadian Dollar\n(CAD)\n■Broad Economic Performance\nCanada is the world’s eleventh largest country with GDP valued at US$1.8 trillion as\nof 2014. As a resource-based economy, the country’s early economic development\nhinged on the development, exploitation, and exports of natural resources. It is\nnow the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold. However, in actuality,\nnearly two-thirds of the country’s GDP comes from the service sector, which also\nemploys three out of four Canadians. The strength in the service sector is partly\nattributed to the trend by businesses to subcontract a large portion of their services.\nThis may include a manufacturing company subcontracting delivery services to a\ntransportation company. Despite this, manufacturing and resources are still very\nimportant for the Canadian economy, as it represents over 25% of the country’s\nexports and is a primary source of income for a number of provinces.\nThe Canadian economy started to advance with the depreciation of its currency\nagainst the U.S. dollar and the Free Trade Agreement that came into effect in January\n1989. This agreement eliminated almost all trade tariffs between the United States\nand Canada. As a result, Canada now exports over 85% of its goods to the United\nStates. Further negotiations to incorporate Mexico created the North American Free\nTrade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect on January 1994. This more advanced\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)264treaty eliminated most tariffs on trading b etween all three countries. Canada’s close\ntrade relationship with the United States makes it particularly sensitive to the health\nof the U.S. economy. If the U.S. economy sputters, demand for Canadian exports\nwould suffer. The same is true for the opposite scenario; if U.S. economic growth\nis robust, Canadian exports will beneﬁt. In the past decade, trade with China has\nalso increased signiﬁcantly, rising in the ranks from the ﬁfth to the second most\nimportant trade partner for Canada. The following is a breakdown of Canada’s key\nexport and import markets:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. United Kingdom\n4. Japan\n5. Mexico\nLeading Import Sources\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Japan\n4. Mexico\n5. United Kingdom\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Governing Council of the Bank of Canada is the board that is responsible for\nsetting Canadian monetary policy. This council consists of seven members: the\ngovernor and six deputy governors. The Bank of Canada meets approximately eight\ntimes per year to discuss changes in monetary policy. They also release a monthly\nmonetary policy update every quarter, but the rate decision itself is the big market\nmover for the currency.\nCentral Bank Goals\nThe Bank of Canada’s primary focus is on maintaining the ‘‘integrity and value of\nthe currency,’’ and this involves ensuring pri ce stability. Price stability is maintained\nby adhering to an inﬂation target currently set by the Department of Finance at\n1% to 3%. The Bank believes that high inﬂation can damage the functioning of the\neconomy. In their opinion, low inﬂation on the other hand equates to price stability,\nwhich can help to foster sustainable long-term economic growth. The BoC controls\ninﬂation through short-term interest rates. If inﬂation is above the target, the Bank\nwill apply tighter monetary conditions. If it is below the target, the Bank will loosen\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)265monetary policy. Overall, the central bank has done a pretty good job of keeping\nthe inﬂation target within the band since 1998.\nThe Bank measures monetary conditions using its Monetary Conditions Index,\nwhich is a weighted sum of changes in the 90-day commercial paper rate and G-10\ntrade-weighted exchange rates. The weight of the interest rate versus the exchange\nrate is 3 to 1, which is the affect of a chan ge in interest rates on the exchange rate\nbased on historical studies. This means that a 1% increase in short-term interest\nrates is the same as a 3% appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate. To\nchange monetary policy, the BoC manipulates the Bank Rate, which can in turn\naffect the exchange rate. If the currency appreciates to undesirable levels, the BoC\ncan decrease interest rates to offset the rise. If it depreciates, the BoC can raise rates.\nHowever, interest rate changes are not used for the purposes of manipulating the\nexchange rate. Instead, they are used to control inﬂation but an excessively strong\ncurrency and lower inﬂationary pressures can accelerate the changes. The following\nare the most commonly used tools by the BoC to implement monetary policy.\nBank Rate\nThe Bank Rate is the main rate used to control inﬂation. This is the rate of interest\nthat the Bank of Canada charges to commercial banks. Changes to this rate will affect\nother interest rates, including mortgage rates and prime rates charged by commercial\nbanks. Therefore, changes to this rate will ﬁlter into the overall economy.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) is the framework for the Bank of Canada’s\nimplementation of monetary policy. It is through this framework that Canada’s\ncommercial banks borrow and lend overnight money to each other in order to fund\ntheir daily transactions. The LVTS is an electronic platform through which these\nﬁnancial institutions conduct large transactions. The interest rate charged on these\novernight loans is called the overnight rate or bank rate. The BoC can manipulate the\novernight rate by offering to lend at rates lower or higher than the current market\nrate if the overnight lending rate is trading above or below the target banks.\nOn a regular basis, the bank releases a number of publications that are important to\nfollow. This includes a biannual Monetary Policy Report that contains an assessment of\nthe current economic environment and implications for inﬂation and a quarterly Bank\nof Canada Review that includes economic commentary, featured articles, speeches by\nmembers of the Governing Council, and important announcements.\nImportant Characteristics of the Canadian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . As the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold,\nCanada’s economy is highly dependent on commodities. This creates a strong\npositive correlation between the Canadian dollar and oil prices. Generally\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)266speaking, when oil prices rise, it beneﬁts domestic producers and increases their\nincome from exports. However at the same time, strong commodity prices can\nhurt growth abroad; so while rising oil prices are initially positive for Canada,\nthe negative impact on global growth could lead to a decline in demand over the\nmedium term. On the ﬂip side, falling oil prices are negative for the Canadian\ndollar; but if prices remain low and global growth beneﬁts, it can eventually\nneutralize the negative impact.\n■Strong correlation with the United States . Since the 1980s, Canada has been running\nmerchandise trade surpluses with the United States and now approximately 77%\nof Canadian exports are bound for the Untied States. This heavy reliance on U.S.,\ndemand makes Canada extremely sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy. As the\nU.S. economy accelerates, trade increases with Canadian companies, lifting overall\neconomic activity. However, as the U.S. economy slows, the Canadian economy\nwill be hurt signiﬁcantly as U.S. companies reduce their importing activities.\n■Mergers and acquisitions . Due to the proximity of the United States and Canada,\ncross-border mergers and acquisitions are very common, as companies worldwide\nstrive for globalization. These mergers and acquisitions lead to money ﬂowing\nbetween the two countries, which ulti mately impacts the currencies. In 2001,\nthe signiﬁcant U.S. acquisition of Canadian energy companies infused US$25\nbillion into Canada. This led to a strong rally in USDCAD, as the U.S. companies\nneeded to sell USD and buy CAD to pay for their acquisitions. Any similar type\nof M&A ﬂow in the future will also have a signiﬁcant but short-term impact on\nthe Canadian dollar.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of\nCanada and the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries\nare closely watched by professional Canadian dollar traders. These differentials\ncan be good indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much\npremium yield Canadian short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, and vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Carry trades . A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. When\nCanada has a higher interest rate than th e United States, the short USDCAD carry\ntrade becomes more attractive; but if th e United States emba rks on a tightening\ncampaign or Canada lowers rates, the positive interest rate differential between\nthe Canadian dollar and other currencies would narrow. In such situations, the\nCanadian dollar could come under pressure if the speculators begin to exit out of\ntheir carry trades.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)267■Important Economic Indicators for Canada\nCanadian economic reports can have a signiﬁcant impact on the currency. Here are\na handful of the most important releases.\nCanadian Employment\nEvery month, Canada releases its labor market report and this report provides more\ndetails than that of the United States. Job growth is expressed as net job growth and\nthen split into full- and part-time hirers. Generally speaking, the market prefers that\nthe bulk of job growth is full time, because it represents real long-term employment\nand not short-term hires that can be laid off at any time. The unemployment rate is\nalso released, and the number of unemployed persons is expressed as a percentage\nof the labor force.\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\nThe monthly consumer price report measures the average rate of increase in prices.\nWhen economists speak of inﬂation as an economic problem, they generally mean\na persistent increase in the general price level over a period of time, resulting in a\ndecline in a currency’s purchasing power. Inﬂation is often measured as a percentage\nincrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Canada’s inﬂation policy, as set out\nby the federal government and the Bank of Canada, aims to keep inﬂation within\na target range of 1% to 3%. If the rate of inﬂation is 10% a year, $100 worth of\npurchases last year will, on average, cost $110 this year. At the same inﬂation rate,\nthose purchases will cost $121 next year, and so on.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nThe gross domestic product measures the total value of all goods and services\nproduced within Canada during a given year. It is a measure of the income generated\nby production within Canada. GDP is also referred to as economic output. To\navoid counting the same output more than once, GDP includes only ﬁnal goods\nand services—not those that are used to make another product. For example, GDP\nwould not include the wheat used to make bread, but would include the bread itself.\nTrade Balance\nThe balance of trade is a statement of a country’s trade in goods (merchandise) and\nservices. It covers trade in products such as manufactured goods, raw materials, and\nagricultural goods, as well as travel and transportation. The balance of trade is the\ndifference between the value of the goods and services that a country exports and\nthe value of the goods and services that it imports. If a country’s exports exceed its\nimports, it has a trade surplus and the trade balance is said to be positive. If imports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)268\nFIGURE 33.1 USDCAD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nexceed exports, the country has a trade deﬁcit, and its trade balance is said to be\nnegative.\nRetail Sales\nRetail sales is a monthly national accounts measure that calculates current expenditure\nby households and producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes\npurchases of durable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure\nby persons on the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by\nunincorporated enterprises. Stronger consumer spending is positive for Canada’s\neconomy and, in turn, the Canadian dollar, whereas weaker consumer spending is\nnegative for Canada’s economy and currency.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.\nFigure 33.1 illustrates the 10-year

As of May 2015, the EU consists of 28 member\ncountries with 19 of these nations sharing the euro as a common currency. The\nEurozone consists of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,\nGreece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,\nPortugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. With the exception of Denmark and the\nUnited Kingdom, other EU states are obliged to join the monetary union when they\nmeet the criteria to do so. Aside from a common currency, these countries also\nshare a single monetary policy dictated by the European Central Bank (ECB). These\ncommon currency countries constitute the European Monetary Union (EMU).\nThe EMU is the world’s second largest economic power, with gross domestic\nproduct valued at approximately US$18 trillion in 2014. With a highly developed\nﬁxed income, equity, and futures market, the EMU is the second most attractive\ninvestment market for domestic and international investors. In its early days, the\nEMU found difﬁculty attracting foreign direct investment or large capital ﬂows\nbecause, historically, the U.S. markets are larger with more consistent returns. As\na result, the U.S. absorbs 71% of total foreign savings. However, with the euro\nbecoming an established currency and the European Monetary Union incorporating\nmore members, the euro’s importance as a reserve currency is rising and translating\ninto greater capital ﬂows. The only problem is that European bond markets are\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)214fragmented, and there are not enough quality assets for central banks to invest in.\nUnless there are euro bonds, foreign central banks could be slow to diversify their\nreserve holdings. Nonetheless, they will do so gradually, providing ongoing support\nfor the euro.\nTrade is extremely important to Eurozone nations and most countries conduct\nthe majority of their trade with other states in the region. This is important because\none of the most valuable aspects of the euro is its facilitation of trade activity through\nthe elimination of exchange rate risk. Large Eurozone nations such as Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Spain also conduct signiﬁcant trade activity with countries like the\nUnited States and China. This makes the value of the euro particularly important\nto economic activity. A country like the United States is less sensitive to exchange\nrate ﬂuctuations because most of its demand is internal, but Europe is extremely\nsensitive to its exchange rate because many Eurozone nations rely on external\ndemand. The size and scope of the EMU’s trade with the rest of the world provides\nit with signiﬁcant power in the international trade arena. International clout is also\none of the primary goals in the formation of the European Union, because it allows\nindividual nations to negotiate as a group on an equal playing ﬁeld with the United\nStates and China, their two largest trading partners. The breakdowns of the most\nimportant trading partners for the European Union are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Switzerland\n4. Russia\n5. Turkey\nLeading Import Sources\n1. China\n2. Russia\n3. United States\n4. Norway\n5. Switzerland\nWhile trade is extremely important, the service sector has the largest share of\ntotal output followed by manufacturing. In fact, a large number of the companies\nwhose primary purpose is to produce ﬁnished products still concentrate their EU\nactivity on innovation, research, design, and marketing, while outsourcing most of\ntheir manufacturing activities to Asia.\nThe EU’s growing role in international trade has major implications for the role of\nthe euro as a reserve currency. As more countries conduct trade with the Eurozone,\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)215they will be motivated to accumulate more euros to reduce exchange risk and\ntransaction costs. Traditionally, most international trade transactions involve the\nBritish pound, the Japanese yen, and/or the U.S. dollar. Before the establishment of\nthe euro, it was unreasonable to hold large amounts of every individual EU national\ncurrency. As a result, currency reserves tended toward the dollar. At the end of the\n1990s, approximately 65% of all world reserves were held in U.S. dollars, but after\nthe introduction of the euro, foreign reserve assets slowly shifted towards the euro.\nThis trend will only continue as the world becomes more globalized.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nMakers—The European Central Bank\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is the governing body responsible for determining\nthe monetary policy of the countries participating in the EMU. The Executive Board\nof the EMU consists of the president of the ECB, the vice president of the ECB, and\nfour other members. These individuals, along with the governors of the national\ncentral banks, comprise the Governing Council. The ECB is set up such that the\nExecutive Board implements the policies dictated by the Governing Council. New\nmonetary policies decisions are typically made by majority vote, with the president\nhaving the casting vote in the event of a tie in their monthly meeting. After each\nmeeting the Central Bank president holds a press conference to answer questions.\nThis is also used as an opportunity to clarify their monetary policy stance.\nThe EMU’s primary objective is to maintain price stability and promote growth.\nMonetary and ﬁscal policy changes are made to ensure that this objective is met. With\nthe formation of the EMU, the Maastric ht Treaty was developed by the Union to\napply a number of criteria for each member country. These criteria were developed\nby the Union to help them achieve their objective. Deviations from these criteria\nby any one country will result in heavy ﬁnes. Listed below are the EMU criteria.\nIt is apparent based on these criteria that the ECB has a strict mandate focused on\ninﬂation and deﬁcit. Generally, the ECB strives to maintain annual growth in HCPI\n(Harmonized Consumer Price Index) below 2% and M3 (Money Supply) annual\ngrowth around 4.5%.\nThe EMU Criteria\nIn the 1992 Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) the following\npreconditions were created for any EU member state looking to join the economic\nand monetary union (EMU).\n■A rate of inﬂation no more than 1.5% above the average of the three best\nperforming member states, taking the average of the 12-month year-on-year rate\npreceding the assessment date.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)216■Long-term interest rates not exceeding the average rates of these low-inﬂation\nstates by more than 2% for the preceding 12 months.\n■Exchange rates which ﬂuctuate within the normal margins of the exchange-rate\nmechanism (ERM) for at least two years.\n■A general government debt/GDP ratio of not more than 60%, although a higher\nratio may be permissible if it is ‘‘sufﬁciently diminishing.’’\n■A general government deﬁcit not exceeding 3% of GDP, although a small and\ntemporary excess can be permitted.\nIf a country meets the convergence criteria and joins the EMU, their monetary\npolicy will be determined by the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB and the\nESCB (European System of Central Banks) are independent institutions from both\nnational governments and other EU institutions, granting them complete control\nover monetary policy. This operational independence is accorded to them as per\nArticle 108 of the Maastricht Treaty, which states that any member of the decision-\nmaking bodies cannot seek or take instructions from any Community Institutions,\nany government of a member state, or any other body. In other words, no one\ncountry can pressure the ECB into making a monetary policy change that is in only\ntheir best interest. The primary tools the ECB uses to control monetary policy is the\nfollowing.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe ECB has four main categories of open market operations to steer interest rates,\nmanage liquidity, and signal monetary policy stance. This includes:\n■Main reﬁnancing operations . These are regular liquidity-providing reverse transac-\ntions conducted weekly with a maturity o f two weeks, which provide the bulk of\nreﬁnancing to the ﬁnancial sector.\n■Longer-term reﬁnancing operations . These are liquidity-providing reverse transactions\nwith a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months, which provide\ncounterparties with additional longer-term reﬁnancing.\n■Fine-tuning operations . These are executed on an ad-hoc basis, with the aim of\nboth managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates, in\nparticular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected\nliquidity ﬂuctuations.\n■Structural operations . These involve the issuance of debt certiﬁcates, reverse trans-\nactions, and outright transactions. These operations will be executed whenever\nthe ECB wishes to adjust th e structural position of the Eurosystem vis-` a-vis the\nﬁnancial sector (on a regular or nonregular basis).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)217ECB Minimum Bid Rate (Repo Rate)\nThe ECB minimum bid rate is the key policy target for the ECB and the level of\nborrowing that the ECB offers to the central banks of its member states. This is also\nthe rate that is subject to change at the monthly ECB meetings. Since inﬂation is a\nmajor concern for European policy makers, they are generally more inclined to keep\ninterest rates at lofty levels to prevent inﬂation. Changes in the ECB’s minimum bid\nrate can have large ramiﬁcations for the EUR.\nThe ECB does not have an exchange rate target, but will factor in exchange rates\nin their policy deliberations because they can affect price stability. A high exchange\nrate lowers inﬂationary pressures while a low exchange rate promotes it. The ECB is\nnot prohibited from intervening in the foreign exchange markets if they believe that\ninﬂation is a concern. As a result, comments by members of the Governing Council\nare closely watched by forex traders and can have a signiﬁcant impact on the euro.\nIn addition to their monthly meetings, the Central Bank will also publish a\nmonthly bulletin and release staff forecasts and minutes from past meetings. The\npresident of the Central Bank holds a press conference after the policy meeting and\nthat, along with each of these event risk s, can cause volatility in the currency.\nNow let’s take a look at some of the important characteristics of the euro:\n■EURUSD cross is the most liquid and actively traded currency . The euro was introduced\nas an electronic currency in January 1999. At the time, the euro replaced all\npre-EMU currencies, except for Greece’s currency, which was converted to the\neuro in January 2001. As a result, the EURUSD cross is now the most liquid\ncurrency in the world and its movements are used as the primary gauge of the\nhealth of both the European and U.S. economies. Figure 27.1 highlights the\n10 year performance of EUR-USD. The euro is most frequently known as the\n‘‘anti-dollar’’ since dollar or U.S. fundamentals generally have a greater impact\non the movement of the currency.\nEURJPY and EURCHF are also very liquid currencies that can be used as a\ngauge of the health of the Japanese and Swiss economies. Many new traders will\nstart with the EURUSD because of its orderly movements, tight spread, and\nliquidity.\n■Euro: A currency without a country . One of the greatest problems of the euro is that it\nis currency without a country. Instead, it bears the economic, political, and social\nrisks of 19 different nations. This is its gr eatest strength and its greatest weakness.\nIn the past decade, we have seen how the debt crisis in smaller Eurozone nations\nhave affected the currency as a whole. It undermines conﬁdence and has, on many\noccasions, put the entire monetary union at risk.\n■Spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and 10-year Bunds can indicate euro sentiment .\nTen-year government bonds can serve as an important indicator of where the euro\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)218\nFIGURE 27.1 EURUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)219is headed, especially against the U.S. dollar. The differential between the 10-year\nU.S. government bond and the 10-year German Bund rates can provide a good\nindication for EURUSD’s movement. If Bund rates are higher than U.S. Treasury\nrates and the differential increases, or the spread widens, this is generally positive\nfor the EURUSD. Alternatively, a decrease in the differential or a tightening of\nthe interest rates is generally bearish for EURUSD. As there is no Euro bond,\nthe 10-year German Bund yield is typically used as the benchmark bond for the\nEurozone because Germany is the largest country in the monetary union.\n■Predictions for euro area money ﬂows . Another useful rate to follow is the three-month\ninterest rate, also known as the euro interbank offer rate or the Euribor rate. This\nis the rate offered from one large bank to another on interbank term deposits.\nTraders tend to compare the Euribor futures rate with the Eurodollar futures rate.\nEurodollars are deposits denominated in U.S. dollars at banks and other ﬁnancial\ninstitutions outside the United States. Because investors like high-yielding assets,\nEuropean ﬁxed-income assets become more attractive as the spread between\nEuribor futures and Eurodollar futures widens in favor of Euribors. As the spread\nnarrows, European assets become less attractive, whereby implying a potential\ndecrease in money ﬂows into the Euro.\nMergers and acquisition activity can also affect how the EURUSD moves.\nIn recent years we have seen increased M&A activity between EU and U.S.\nmultinationals. Large deals, especially with a large cash component, can lead to a\nsudden burst in the EURUSD, but the reaction is generally short-lived.\n■Important Indicators for the Euro\nWhen it comes to Eurozone economic reports, the only ones that affect the euro are\nGerman or Eurozone data. The largest countries in the Eurozone in order of GDP\ncontribution are Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. While French and Italian data\nare important, they rarely move the currency. So what forex traders should focus on\nare the broader regional reports and German data. Central bank rate decisions are\nthe most important, but here are some additional economic reports that can have\nmeaningful impact on the currency.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the Manufacturing\nand Service sectors. For the Eurozone, they provide this data for the four largest\neconomies and a composite index for the region. These numbers are extremely\nmarket moving because they provide the most up-to-date information on how each\nof the economies are performing in the current month and not how the economies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)220performed the previous month like many other reports. However, since the reports\nare for the current period, they are usually subject to revisions so the euro will\nmove on the preliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents\nexpansion, and a reading below 50 represents contraction. For the Eurozone, the\nmanufacturing PMI index is the most important along with the composite index,\nwhich aggregates how the manufacturing and service sector are performing. Since\nthe German data are released shortly before the Eurozone report, they can have a\ngreater impact on the currency.\nIFO Survey\nGermany is by far the largest economy in Europe and is responsible for approximately\n20% of total GDP. Any insight into German business conditions is seen as an insight\ninto Europe as a whole. The IFO is a monthly survey conducted by the IFO institute.\nThey survey over 7,000 German businesses, asking for their assessment of the\nGerman business climate and their short-term plans. The initial publication of the\nresults consists of the business climate headline ﬁgure and its two equally weighted\nsubindices: current business conditions and business expectations. The typical range\nis from 80 to 120, with a higher number indicating greater business conﬁdence. The\nreport is most valuable, however, when measured against previous data.\nInﬂation Indicators—HICP\nSince the ECB has an inﬂation mandate, the EU Harmonized Index of Consumer\nPrices (HICP) published by Eurostat is very important. This harmonized index is\ndesigned for international comparison as required by EU law. The index is compiled\nwith information on prices retrieved by each national statistical agency. Individual\ncountries are required to provide Eurostat with the 100 indices used to compute the\nHICP. The national HICPs are totaled by Eurostat as a weighted average of these\nsubindices, and the weights used are country-speciﬁc. The HICP is released at the\nend of the month following the reference period, which is about 10 days after the\npublications of the national CPIs from Spain and France, the ﬁnal EMU-5 countries\nto release their CPIs. Even if part of the information is already known when the\nHICP is released, it is an important release because it serves as the reference inﬂation\nindex for the ECB who aims to keep Eurozone consumer price inﬂation between\n0% and 2%.\nGerman Industrial Production\nIndustrial production data are seasonally adjusted (SA) and include a breakdown into\nfour major subcategories: mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction. The\nmanufacturing aggregate comprises four main product groups: basic and producer\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)221goods, capital goods, consumer durables, and consumer nondurables. The market\ntends to pay attention to the annual rate of change and the seasonally adjusted\nmonth-on-month ﬁgure. Germany’s ﬁgure is most important since it is the largest\ncountry in the Eurozone; however, the market can also react to the French industrial\nproduction report. The initial industrial production release is based on a narrower\ndata sample and hence subject to revision when the full sample has become available.\nThe ministry occasionally provides insight on the expected direction of the revision\nin the initial data release.\nGerman Unemployment\nLabor market numbers are important for every country and in the case of the\nEurozone, German unemployment is the most important. Released by the Labor\nOfﬁce, the data contain information on the number of unemployed, as well as\nthe changes on the previous month, on both seasonally (SA) and nonseasonally\n(NSA) adjusted terms. The NSA unemployment rate is provided, along with data\non vacancies, short-shift working arrangements, and the number of employees\n(temporarily suspended in 1999). Within an hour after the FLO release, the\nBundesbank releases the SA unemployment rate. The day ahead of the release,\nthere is often a leak of the ofﬁcial data from a trade-union source. The leak is\nusually of the NSA level of unemployment in millions. When a precise ﬁgure is\nreported on Reuters, as given by ‘‘sources’’ for the NSA level of unemployment,\nthe leak usually reﬂects t he ofﬁcial ﬁgures. Rumors often circulate up to one week\nbefore the ofﬁcial release, and they are notoriously imprecise. Regardless, a drop\nin unemployment along with an improvement in the jobless rate is positive for the\ncurrency, whereas a rise in jobless claims or increase in the unemployment rate is\nnegative for the currency.\nPreliminary GDP\nPreliminary GDP is issued when Eurostat has collected data from a sufﬁcient number\nof countries to produce an estimate. This usually includes France, Germany, and\nthe Netherlands. However, Italy is not included in the preliminary release and is\nonly added in the ﬁnal number. The yearly aggregates for EU-15 and EMU-11\nare a simple sum of national GDP. For the quarterly accounts, the aggregation is\nmore complex since some countries (Greece, Ireland, and Luxembourg) do not\nyet produce quarterly national accounts data. Moreover, Portugal produces only\npartial quarterly accounts with a signiﬁcant lag. Thus, both the EU-15 and EMU-11\nquarterly paths are the result of estimates from quarterly data based on a group of\ncountries accounting for more than 95% of total EU GDP (see the Foreword for a\ndetailed description of the weights of each country in the EU).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)222M3\nM3 is a broad measure of money supply, which includes everything from notes\nand coins to bank deposits. The ECB closely monitors M3 as they view it as a key\nmeasure of inﬂation. At its session in December 1998, the governing council of the\nECB set its ﬁrst reference value for M3 growth at 4.5%. This value supports inﬂation\nb e l o w2 % ,t r e n dg r o w t ho f2 %t o2 . 5 % ,a n dal o n g - t e r md e c l i n ei nt h ev e l o c i t y\nof money by 0.5% to 1%. The growth rate is monitored on a three-month moving\naverage basis in order to prevent monthly volatility to distort the information given\nby the aggregate. The ECB’s approach to monetary targeting leaves considerable\nroom for maneuver and interpretation. Because the ECB does not impose bands\non M3 growth, as the Bundesbank used to do, there will be no automatic action\nwhen M3 growth diverges from the reference value. Moreover, although the ECB\nconsiders M3 to be the key indicator, it will also take into account the changes in\nother monetary aggregates.\nIndividual Country Budget Deﬁcits\nThe Stability and Growth Pact states that budget deﬁcits for every country in the\nmonetary union must be kept below 3% of GDP. Failure to meet these targets will\nbe punished. However through the years many Eurozone nations have had deﬁcits\nin excess of 3% and penalties have not been enforced.\n223CHAPTER 28\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nBritish Pound (GBP)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe United Kingdom is the world’s ﬁfth largest economy with GDP valued at\napproximately US$3 trillion in 2014 according to the IMF. With one of the most\ndynamic central banks in the world, the UK economy beneﬁted from many years of\nstrong growth, low unemployment, expa nding output, and resilient consumption.\nThe strength of consumer consumption has been largely due to the strong housing\nmarket. The United Kingdom is a service-oriented economy, with manufacturing\nrepresenting an increasingly smaller portion of GDP, now equivalent to only one-\nﬁfth of national output. Their capital market system is one of the most developed\nin the world, with ﬁnance and banking being the strongest contributors to GDP.\nAlthough the majority of the UK’s GDP is from services, it is also one of the\nlargest producers and exporters of natural gas in the European Union. The energy\nproduction industry accounts for 10% of GDP, which is one of the highest shares of\nany industrialized nation. This is particularly important, as increases in energy prices\n(such as oil) will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt the large number of UK oil exporters. (The\nUnited Kingdom became a net oil importer for a brief period due to disruptions in\nthe North Sea in 2003, but it has already resumed its status as a net oil exporter.)\nOverall, the United Kingdom is a net importer of goods with a consistent\ntrade deﬁcit. Its largest trading partner is the EU, with trade between the two\nconstituencies accounting for over 50% of all of the country’s import and export\nactivities. The United States, on an individual basis, still remains the United\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)224Kingdom’s largest trading partner. The breakdowns of the most important trading\npartners for the United Kingdom are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. Germany\n3. Switzerland\n4. Netherlands\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Netherlands\n3. China\n4. United States\n5. France\nSince the launch of the euro in 1999, the single currency’s troubles have become\nincreasingly apparent, and this has made the UK’s decision to maintain its own\ncurrency and monetary authority increasingly intelligent. Yet the possibility of euro\nadoption will remain a question in the minds of pound traders for many years\nto come, although in 2015 into 2016, the more relevant question is whether the\nUnited Kingdom will remain in the EMU. A decision on euro entry has signiﬁcant\nramiﬁcations for the UK economy—the most important of which is that UK interest\nrates would have to be adjusted to reﬂect the equivalent interest rate of the Eurozone.\nOne of the primary arguments against adopting the euro is that the UK government\nhas sound macroeconomic policies that have worked very well for the country for\ndecades. Its successful monetary and ﬁscal policies have led it to outperform most\nmajor economies during economic downturns, including the European Union.\nThe UK Treasury has previously speciﬁed ﬁve economic tests that must be met\nprior to euro entry, which are the following:\nUK’s Five Economic Tests for Euro\n1. Is there sustainable convergence in business cycles and economic structures\nbetween the United Kingdom and other EMU members, so that the UK citizens\ncould live comfortably with euro interest rates on a permanent basis?\n2. Is there enough ﬂexibility to cope with economic change?\n3. Would joining the EMU create an environment that would encourage ﬁrms to\ninvest in the United Kingdom?\n4. Would joining the EMU have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the\nUK’s ﬁnancial services industry?\n5. Would joining the EMU be good for promoting stability and growth in\nemployment?\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)225The United Kingdom is a very political country where government ofﬁcials are\nhighly concerned with voter approval. If voters do not support euro entry, the\nlikelihood of EMU entry would decline. The following are some of the arguments\nfor and against adopting the euro:\nArguments in Favor of Adopting the Euro\n■There would be reduced exchange rate uncertainty for UK businesses and lower\nexchange rate transa ction costs or risks.\n■The prospect of sustained low inﬂation under the governance of the European\nCentral Bank should reduce long-term interest rates and stimulate sustained\neconomic growth.\n■Single currency promotes price transparency.\n■The integration of national ﬁnancial markets of the EU will lead to higher efﬁciency\nin the allocation of capital in Europe.\n■The euro is the second most important reserve currency after the USD.\n■With the United Kingdom joining the euro, the political clout of the EMU would\nincrease dramatically.\nArguments against Adopting the Euro\n■Currency unions have collapsed in the past.\n■Economic or political instabilities of one country would impact the Euro, which\nwould have exchange rate ramiﬁcations for otherwise healthy countries.\n■Strict EMU criteria outlined by the Stability and Growth Pact.\n■Entry would mean a permanent transfer of domestic monetary authority to the\nEuropean Central Bank.\n■Joining a currency union with no monetary ﬂexibility would require the United\nKingdom to have more ﬂexibility in the labor and housing markets.\n■There are fears about which countries might dominate the ECB.\n■Adjusting to new currency will require large transaction costs.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Bank\nof England\nFor the United Kingdom, the Bank of England (BoE) controls monetary policy, and\nthe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is a nine-member committee responsible\nfor setting interest rate policy in the United Kingdom. It consists of a governor,\ntwo deputy governors, two executive directors of the central bank, and four outside\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)226experts. The committee was granted operational independence in 1997, which\nmeans they won’t be inﬂuenced by the governing party. Despite this independence,\nmonetary policies have centered on achieving an inﬂation target dictated by the\nChancellor of the Treasury. Currently, this target is RPIX (Retail Price Index)\ninﬂation of 2.5%. The central bank has the power to change interest rates to levels\nthat will allow them to meet this target. The MPC holds monthly meetings, which\nare closely followed for announcements on changes in monetary policy, including\nchanges in the interest rate (bank repo rate). When no changes are made, no details\nare provided. In this case, the rate decision is generally a nonevent for the currency,\nwith traders shifting their focus to the minutes released two weeks later.\nThe MPC publishes statements after every meeting, along with a quarterly\nInﬂation Report that details the MPC’s two-year forecast for growth and inﬂation\nalong with justiﬁcation for policy movements. In addition, another publication,\ntheQuarterly Bulletin, provides information on past monetary policy movements\nand analysis of the international economic environment and its impacts on the UK\neconomy. All of these reports can provide guidance of future policy changes. The\nmain policy tools used by the MPC and BoE are the following.\nBank Repo Rate\nThis is the key rate used in monetary policy to meet the Treasury’s inﬂation target.\nThis rate is set for the Bank’s own operati ons in the market, such as its short-term\nlending activities. Changes to this rate affect the rates set by the commercial banks\nfor their savers and borrowers. In turn, this rate will affect spending and output in\nthe economy, and eventually costs and prices. An increase in this rate would imply\nan attempt to curb inﬂation and slow growth, while a decrease in this rate would be\naimed at stimulating growth and expansion.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe goal of open market operations is to implement changes in the bank repo rate,\nwhile assuring adequate liquidity in the market and continued stability in the banking\nsystem. This is reﬂective of the three main objectives of the BoE: maintaining the\nintegrity and value of the currency, maintaining the stability of the ﬁnancial system,\nand seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the United Kingdom’s ﬁnancial services.\nTo ensure liquidity, the Bank conducts daily open market operations to buy or sell\nshort-term government ﬁxed-income instruments. If this is not sufﬁcient to meet\nliquidity needs, the Bank would also conduct additional overnight operations.\nImportant Characteristics of the British Pound\n■GBPUSD is very liquid . The GBPUSD is one of the most liquid currencies in the\nworld, with 6% of all currency trading involving the British pound as either\nthe base or counter currency. It is also one of the three most liquid currencies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)227alongside EURUSD and USDJPY. One of the reasons for the currency’s liquidity\nis the country’s highly developed capital markets. Many foreign investors seeking\nopportunities other than the United States have sent their funds to the United\nKingdom for investment. In order to create these transactions, foreigners will\nneed to sell their local currency and buy British pounds.\n■GBP has three names . The UK’s currency has three names: the British pound,\nsterling, and cable. All of these are used interchangeably.\n■GBP is laden with speculators . At the time of publication, the British pound has one\nof the highest interest rates among the developed nations. Although Australia\nand New Zealand have higher interest rates, their ﬁnancial markets are not as\ndeveloped as that of the United Kingdom. As a result, many investors who already\nhave positions or are interested in initiating new carry trades positions frequently\nuse the GBP as the lending currency and will go long the pound against currencies\nsuch as the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. A carry trade involves\nbuying or lending a currency with a higher interest and selling or borrowing a\ncurrency with a lower interest rate. In recent years, carry trades have increased in\npopularity, which helped spur demand for the British pound. However, should the\ninterest rate yield differential bet ween the pound and other currencies narrow,\nan exodus of carry traders will increase volatility in the British pound.\n■Interest rate differentials between Gilt s and foreign bonds ar e closely followed . Interest rate\ndifferentials between UK Gilts—U.S. Tr easuries and UK Gilts and German Bunds\nare widely watched by FX market participants. Gilts versus Treasuries can be a\nbarometer of GBPUSD ﬂows, while Gilts versus Bunds can be used as a barometer\nfor EURGBP ﬂows. More speciﬁcally, these interest rate differentials indicate how\nmuch premium yield UK ﬁxed-income assets are offering over U.S. and European\n(German Bunds are usually used as a barometer for European yield) ﬁxed-income\nassets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders with indications of potential\ncapital ﬂow or currency movements, as global investors are always shifting their\ncapital in search of the assets with the highest yields. The United Kingdom can\nprovide these yields with the safety of having the same credit stability as the United\nStates.\n■Euro sterling futures can give indications for interest rate movements .S i n c et h eU K\ninterest rate or bank repo rate is the primary tool used in monetary policy, it is\nimportant to keep abreast of potential changes to the interest rate. Comments\nfrom government ofﬁcials is one way to gauge biases for potential rate changes,\nbut the Bank of England is one of the only central banks that requires members\nof the Monetary Policy Committee to publish their speciﬁc voting records.\nThis personal accountability indicates that comments by individual committee\nmembers represent their own opinions and not that of the BoE. Therefore,\nit is necessary to look for other indication of potential BoE rate movements.\nThree-month euro sterling futures reﬂect market expectations on euro sterling\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)228\nFIGURE 28.1 GBPUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\ninterest rates three months into the future. These contracts are also useful in\npredicting UK interest rate changes, which will ultimately affect the ﬂuctuations\nof the GBPUSD. Figure 28.1 illustrates 10 year performance of GBP-USD.\n■Comments on euro by UK politicians will impact the euro . Any speeches, remarks\n(especially from the Prime Minister or Treasury Chancellor), or polls in regards\nto the euro will impact currency trade. Indication of adoption of the euro tends\nto put downward pressure on GBP, while further opposition to euro entry will\ntypically boost the GBP. Reason being that in order for the GBP to come in line\nwith the euro, interest rates would have to decline and monetary policy would\nhave to be subjected to a foreign entity. A decrease in the interest rate would\ninduce carry trade investors to close their positions or sell pounds. The GBPUSD\nwould also decline because of the uncertainties involved with Euro adoption. The\nUK economy is performing very well under the direction of its current monetary\nauthority. The EMU is currently encountering many difﬁculties with member\ncountries breaching EMU criteria. With one monetary authority dictating 19\ncountries (plus UK would be 20), the EMU has yet to prove that they have\ndeveloped a monetary policy suitable for all member states.\n■GBP has positive correlation with energy prices . The UK houses some of the largest\nenergy companies in the world, including British Petroleum. Energy production\nrepresents 10% of GDP. As a result, the British pound tends to have a positive\ncorrelation with energy prices. Speciﬁcally, since many members of the EU\nimport oil from the United Kingdom, as oil prices increase, they will, in turn,\nhave to buy more pounds to fund their energy purchases. In addition, rises in the\nprice of oil will also beneﬁt the earnings of the nations’ energy exporters.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)229■GBP crosses . Although the GBP/USD is a more liquid currency than EURGBP,\nEURGBP is typically the leading gauge for GBP strength. The GBPUSD currency\npair tends to be more sensitive to U.S. developments, while EURGBP is a\nmore pure fundamental pound trade since Europe is Britain’s primary trade\nand investment partner. However, both currencies are naturally interdependent,\nwhich means movements in the EURGBP can affect movements in the GBPUSD.\nThe reverse is also true—that is, movements in GBPUSD will also affect trading\nin EURGBP. Therefore, it is important for pound traders to be consciously aware\nof the trading behavior of both currency pairs. The EURGBP rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURUSD divided by the GBPUSD rate. Small differences in\nthese rates are often exploited by market participants and quickly eliminated.\n■Important Economic Indicators\nfor the United Kingdom\nAll of the following indicators are important for the United Kingdom. However,\nsince the United Kingdom is primarily a service-oriented economy, it is particularly\nimportant to pay attention to service sector data.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the manufacturing,\nservice, and construction sectors. These numbers are extremely market moving\nbecause they provide the most up-to-date information on how each of the economies\nis performing in the current month and not how the economies performed\nthe previous month, like many other reports. However since the reports are for the\ncurrent period, they are usually subject to revisions, so the euro will move on the\npreliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents expansion, and a\nreading below 50 represents contraction. For the United Kingdom, the PMI services\nindex is the most important, along with the composite index, which aggregates how\nthe manufacturing and service sector are performing.\nEmployment Situation\nThe employment report is a monthly survey of the labor market conducted by\nthe Ofﬁce of National Statistics. The obj ectives of the survey are to divide the\nworking-age population into three separate classiﬁcations (employed, unemployed,\nand not in the labor force), and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of\nthese categories. Data from the survey provide market participants with information\non major labor market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors,\nhours worked, labor force participation, and unemployment rates. The timeliness\nof the survey makes it a closely watched s tatistic by the currency market as it is a\ngood barometer of the strength of the UK economy and an important input into\nmonetary policy.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)230Retail Sales\nThe key to growth is consumer spending, and for this reason, the retail sales report\nis also extremely market moving. The Retail Sales Index measures the total goods\nsold by a sampling of retail stores over the course of a month. This index is used as\na gauge of consumer consumption and consumer conﬁdence. While retail sales can\nbe quite volatile due to seasonality, it is one of the most important indicators on the\nhealth of the economy, along with a key input for GDP.\nConsumer or Retail Price Index\nCPI or RPI is a measure of the change in prices of a basket of consumer goods. The\nmarkets however focus on the underlying RPI or RPI-X, which excludes mortgage\ninterest payments. The RPI-X is closely watc hed as the treasury sets inﬂation targets\nfor the BoE, currently deﬁned as 2.5% annual growth in RPI-X.\nGDP\nGDP is a quarterly report conducted by the Bureau of Statistics. GDP is a measure\nof the total production and consumption of goods and services in the UK. GDP\nis measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses, government, and\nnet foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert output measured\nat current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used to gauge where in\nthe business cycle the United Kingdom ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is perceived\nas inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or weak\ngrowth.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures the change in output in the United\nKingdom of manufacturing; mining and quarrying; and electricity, gas, and water\nsupply. Output refers to the physical quantity of items produced, unlike sales value,\nwhich combines quantity and price. The index covers the production of goods and\npower for domestic sales in the United Kingdom and for export. Because IP is\nresponsible for close to a quarter of gross domestic product, IP is widely watched as\nit can provide good insight into the current state of the economy.\nUK Housing Starts\nHousing starts measures the number of residential building construction projects\nthat have begun during any particular month. This is important for the United\nKingdom as the housing market is the primary industry that sustains the economy.\n231CHAPTER 29\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nSwiss Franc (CHF)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nSwitzerland is the twentieth largest economy in the world, with a GDP valued at\nover US$685 billion as of 2014. Although the economy is relatively small, it is one of\nthe wealthiest in the world on a GDP per capita basis. The country is prosperous and\ntechnologically advanced with economic and political stability that rivals many larger\neconomies. The country’s prosperity stems primarily from technological expertise\nin manufacturing, tourism, and banking. More speciﬁcally, Switzerland is known for\ntheir chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, machinery, precision instruments,\nwatches, and a ﬁnancial system historically known for protecting the conﬁdentiality\nof its investors. This coupled with the country’s lengthy history of political neutrality\nearned Switzerland the Swiss franc safe haven status and as a direct result of that,\nit is the one world’s most popular destinations for offshore capital. Even when the\ncentral bank introduced a temporary 1.20 EURCHF peg and lowered interest rates\nto negative levels, Switzerland stil l managed to attract safe haven ﬂows.\nIt is estimated that Switzerland holds over US$2 trillion in offshore assets as of\n2014 and attracts over 35% of the world’s private wealth management business.\nA large and highly advanced banking and insurance industry has developed to support\nthis demand, and the sector employs over 50% of the population and comprises over\n70% of total GDP. Since Switzerland’s ﬁnancial industry thrives on its safe haven\nstatus and renowned conﬁdentiality, capital ﬂows tend to drive the economy during\ntimes of global risk aversion, while trade ﬂows drive the economy in a risk-seeking\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)232environment. Trade ﬂows are extremely important, with nearly two thirds of all\ntrade conducted with Europe. With this in mind, Switzerland’s most important\ntrading partners a re the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Germany\n2. India\n3. United States\n4. Hong Kong\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Italy\n3. United States\n4. France\n5. China\nTraditionally, Switzerland has a strong trade and current account surplus that\nlends support to the currency. Most of the surplus can be attributed to the large\namount of foreign direct investment into the country, in seek of safety of capital,\ndespite the low to negative yields offered by Switzerland.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Swiss\nNational Bank\nMonetary policy in Switzerland is determined by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). They\nare a completely independent authority with a three-person committee responsible\nfor determining monetary policy. This committee consists of a chairman, a vice\nchairman, and one other (member) who constitute the Governing Board of the\nSNB. Due to the small size of the committee, all decisions are based on a consensus\nvote. The Board reviews monetary policy at least once a quarter, but decisions on\nmonetary policy can be made and announced at any point in time. Unlike most other\ncentral banks, the SNB does not set one ofﬁcial interest rate target, but instead sets\na target range for their three-month Swiss Libor rate.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nIn December of 1999, the SNB shifted from focusing on monetary targets (M3) to an\ninﬂation target of less than 2% inﬂation per year. This measure is taken based on the\nnational consumer price index. Monetary targets still remain important indicators\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)233and are closely watched by the central bank, because they provide information on\nthe long-term inﬂation. This new inﬂation focus also increases the central bank’s\ntransparency. In their mandate, they have clearly stated, ‘‘Should inﬂation exceed\n2% in the medium term, the National Bank will tend to tighten its monetary stance.’’\nIf there is danger of deﬂation, the National Bank would loosen monetary policy. The\nSNB also closely monitors exchange rates, as excessive strength in the Swiss franc\ncan cause inﬂationary conditions. This is especially true in environments of global\nrisk aversion, as capital ﬂows into Switzerland increases signiﬁcantly during those\ntimes. As a result, the SNB typically favors a weak franc, and is not hesitant to use\nintervention as liquidity tool. SNB ofﬁcials intervene in the franc using a variety of\nmethods including verbal remarks on liquidity, money supply, and the currency.\nTheir Tools\nThe most commonly used tools by the SNB to implement monetary policy include\nthe following.\nTarget Interest Rate Range\nTraditionally, the SNB implements monetary policy by setting a target range for\ntheir three-month interest rate known as the Swiss Franc Libor rate. According\nto the SNB, ‘‘The Libor is a reference inte rest rate in the interbank market for\nunsecured loans.’’ It is a trimmed mean of the rates charged by 12 leading banks and\nis published daily by the British Bankers’ Association. The National Bank publishes\nits target range regularly. As a rule, this range extends over 1 percentage point,\nand the SNB generally aims to keep the Libor in the middle of the range. The SNB\nundertakes quarterly economic and monetary assessments at which it reviews its\nmonetary policy. If circumstances so require, it will also adjust the Libor target\nrange in between these quarterly assessments. It sets out the reasons for its decisions\nin press releases.\nOpen Market Operations\nRepo transactions are the SNB’s major monetary policy instrument. A repo\ntransaction involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider\n(lender), while agreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity\nat a later date. This structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker\nmust pay the cash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short\nmaturities ranging from one day to a few weeks. The SNB uses these repo transactions\nto manipulate undesirable moves in the three-month Libor rate. To prevent increases\nin the three-month Libor rate above the SNB’s target, the bank would supply the\ncommercial banks with additional liquidity through repo transactions at lower repo\nrates, and in essence create additional liquidity. Conversely, the SNB can reduce\nliquidity or induce increases in the three-month Libor rate by increasing repo rates.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)234In addition to the quarterly monetary policy decision, the SNB publishes a\nQuarterly Bulletin with a detailed assessment of the current state of the economy\nand a review of monetary policy. A Monthly Bulletin is also published containing a\nshort review of economic developments. These reports are important to watch, as\nthey may contain information on changes in the SNB’s assessment of economy and\nguidance on monetary policy.\n1.20 EUR/CHF Peg Implementation and Abandonment\nFew would have expected that one of the seminal developments in the forex market\nwas the Swiss National Bank’s decision to implement and later abandon its 1.20\nEURCHF peg. This decision transformed the foreign exchange industry, bankrupted\nmany brokers, and led to tighter regulations across the globe. Faced with a high level\nof uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued currency and deﬂation risks\nin 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At\nthe time, it pledged to sell francs in an unlimited quantity to maintain the peg. The\ngoal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping the gain in the franc. However,\nin January 2015, the prospect of quantitative easing from the European Central\nBank pushed the SNB to abandon the peg. It also accumulated signiﬁcant foreign\nexchange reserves that irritated critics, but more importantly, the franc became less\novervalued through the years, giving the SNB fewer reasons to maintain the peg.\nSNB’s decision was a complete surprise, and caused a 30% drop in EURCHF in\na single day. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\n■Important Characteristics of the Swiss Franc\n■Safe haven status . This is perhaps the most unique characteristic of the Swiss franc.\nSwitzerland’s safe haven status is continually stressed because this and the secrecy\nof the banking system are the key advantages of Switzerland. The Swiss franc\nmoves primarily on external events rather than domestic economic conditions.\nThat is, as mentioned earlier, due to its political neutrality, the franc is considered\nthe world’s premier safe haven currency. Therefore, in times of global instability\nand/or uncertainty, investors tend to be more concerned with capital retention\nthan appreciation. At such times, funds will ﬂow into Switzerland, which would\ncause the Swiss franc to appreciate regardless of whether growth conditions are\nfavorable.\n■Swiss franc is closely correlated with gold . Switzerland is the world’s third largest\nofﬁcial holder of gold. In the past, a Swiss constitutional mandate required the\ncurrency to be backed 40% with gold reserves. The mandate is now removed\nbut the positive correlation between the Swiss franc and gold remains because\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)235the relationship has been engrained into the minds of forex traders; therefore,\nboth gold and the Swiss franc are perceived as safe haven instruments. Before the\nSNB abandoned the EURCHF 1.20, Swiss franc had an 80% positive correlation\nwith gold. These days, the correlation is still there but in a smaller magnitude.\nGenerally speaking, if the price of gold appreciates, the Swiss franc has a high\nlikelihood of rising in value. In addition, since gold is also viewed as the ultimate\nsafe haven form of money, both gold and the Swiss franc beneﬁt during periods\nof global economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n■Carry trades effects . With one of the lowest interest rates in the industrialized world,\nover the past few years, the Swiss franc has become one of the most popular\nfunding currencies for carry trades. As mentioned in this book, the popularity of\ncarry trades has increased signiﬁcantly over the past two decades, as investors are\nactively seeking high yield. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency\nwith a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest\nrate. With CHF having one of the lowest interest rates of all industrialized\ncountries, it is one of the primary currencies sold or borrowed in carry trades.\nThis results in the need to sell CHF against a higher yielding currency. Carry\ntrades are typically done in cross-currencies such as GBPCHF or AUDCHF, but\nthese trades can impact both EURCHF and USDCHF. The unwinding of carry\ntrades involves the need for investors to buy back the Swiss franc.\n■Interest rate differentials between euro Swiss futures and foreign interest rate futures are\nclosely followed . One of the favorite indicators of professional Swiss franc traders\nis the interest rate differential bet ween three-month euro Swiss futures and\neurodollar futures. These differentials can provide guidance on potential money\nﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield U.S. ﬁxed-income assets are\noffering over Swiss ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides\ntraders with indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always\nlooking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry\ntraders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate\ndifferentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Potential changes in banking regulations . Over the past few years members of the\nEuropean Union have been exerting signiﬁcant pressure on Switzerland to relax\nthe conﬁdentiality of their banking system and to increase transparency of their\ncustomers’ accounts. The European Union is pressing this issue because of its\nactive measures to persecute EU tax evaders. This should be a concern for many\nyears to come. However, this is a difﬁcult decision for Switzerland to make because\nthe conﬁdentiality of their customers’ accounts represents the core strength of\ntheir banking system. The EU has threatened to impose severe sanctions on\nSwitzerland if they do not comply with their proposed measures. Both countries\nare currently working to negotiate an equitable resolution. Any news or talk of\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)236changing banking regulations will impact both Switzerland’s economy and the\nSwiss franc.\n■Mergers and acquisition activity . Switzerland’s primary industry is banking and\nﬁnance. In this industry, merger and acquisition activities (M&A) are very\ncommon, especially as consolidation continues in the overall industry. As a result,\nthese M&A activities can have signiﬁcant impact on the Swiss franc. If foreign\nﬁrms purchase Swiss banks or insurance companies, they will need to buy Swiss\nfrancs and in turn, sell their local currency. If Swiss banks purchase foreign ﬁrms,\nthey would need to sell Swiss francs and buy the foreign currency. Either way,\nit is important for Swiss franc traders to frequently watch for notices on M&A\nactivity involving Swiss ﬁrms.\n■Trading behavior, cross currency characteristics . The EURCHF is the most commonly\ntraded currency for traders who want to participate in CHF movements. USDCHF\nis less frequently traded because of its greater illiquidity and volatility. However,\nday traders may tend to favor USDCHF over EURCHF because of its volatile\nmovements. In actuality, the USDCHF is a synthetic currency derived from\nEURUSD and EURCHF because more tra nsactions are done between the euro\nand Swiss franc. Market makers or professional traders tend to use those pairs as\nleading indicators for trading USDCHF or to price the current USDCHF level\nwhen the currency pair is illiquid. Theoretically, the USDCHF rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURCHF rate divided by EURUSD. Only during times of\nunusual circumstances, such as the Iraq War, September 11, or the EURCHF peg,\nwill USDCHF develop a market of its own. Any small differences in these rates\nare quickly exploited by market participants. Figure 29.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of EUR-CHF.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Switzerland\nEconomic data from Switzerland tends to have limited impact on the currency, but\nthese are the most important pieces of Swiss data.\nKoF Leading Indicators\nThe KoF leading indicators report is released by the Swiss Institute for Business\nCycle Research. This index is generally used to gauge the future health of the\nSwiss economy. It contains six components: (1) change in manufacturers’ orders;\n(2) the expected purchase plans of manufacturers over the next three months; (3)\nthe judgment of stocks in wholesale business; (4) consumer perception of their\nﬁnancial conditions; (5) backlog in the construction sector; and (6) orders backlog\nfor manufacturers.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)\nk\nk237\nk\nk\nFIGURE 29.1 EURCHF 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)238Consumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index is calculated monthly, on the basis of retail prices paid in\nSwitzerland. In accordance with prevalent international practice, the commodities\ncovered are distinguished according to the consumption concept, which includes in\nthe calculation of the CPI of those goods and services that are part of the private\nconsumption aggregate according to the National Accounts. The basket of goods does\nnot include transfer expenditure such as direct taxation, social insurance contributions,\nand health insurance premiums. The index is a key measure of inﬂation.\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services in\nthe Switzerland. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Switzerland ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nBalance of Payments\nBalance of payments is the collective term for the accounts of Swiss transactions\nwith the rest of the world. The current account is the balance of trade plus services\nportion. BoP is an important indicator for Swiss traders, as Switzerland has always\nkept a strong current account balance. Any changes to the current account, positive\nor negative, could see substantial ﬂows.\nProduction Index (Industrial Production)\nThe production index is a quarterly measure of the change in the volume of industrial\nproduction (or physical output by producers).\nRetail Sales\nSwitzerland’s retail sales report is released on a monthly basis 40 days after the\nreference month. The report is an important indicator of consumer spending habits\nand is not seasonally adjusted.\n239CHAPTER 30\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nJapanese Yen (JPY)\n■Economic Overview\nJapan is the third largest economy in the world with GDP valued at over US$4.6\ntrillion in 2014 (behind the United States and China). If we count the European\nUnion as a whole, it would be considered the fourth largest economy. Japan is one of\nthe world’s largest exporters and is responsible for over US$690 billion in exports\nper year. Manufacturing and exports of products such as electronics and cars are the\nsignature drivers of the economy, accounting for nearly 17% of GDP. As a result,\nJapanese growth is extremely sensitive to the value of the currency. For many years,\nJapan has maintained a trade surplus, but the earthquake followed by tsunami in\n2011 turned the country into a net oil importer and created a long period of trade\nimbalances, where oil imports exceeded exports in value. This began to change in\nearly 2015, when a weakening yen and falling oil prices helped to turn around trade\nactivity, returning Japan to a surplus nation. Having a trade surplus means that there\nwill be inherent demand for the Japanese yen even when interest rates are low\nand there are structural deﬁciencies. Japan’s most important trade partners are the\nUnited States and China:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. South Korea\n4. Taiwan\n5. Hong Kong\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)240Leading Import Sources:\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. South Korea\n4. Australia\n5. Saudi Arabia\n■Abenomics\nIn the 1980s, Japan’s capital market was one of the most attractive markets for\ninternational investors seeking investment opportunities in Asia. Japan had the most\ndeveloped capital markets in the region, and its banking system was considered to\nbe the one of the strongest in the world. At the time, the country was experiencing\nabove-trend economic growth and near zero inﬂation. This resulted in rapid\ngrowth expectations, boosted asset prices, and rapid credit expansion, leading to the\ndevelopment of an a sset bubble. Between 1990 and 1997, the asset bubble collapsed,\ninducing a US$10 trillion decline in asset prices, with the fall in real estate values\naccounting for nearly 65% of the total decline, nearly two years of national output.\nThis fall in asset prices sparked the banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early\n1990s and developed into a full-blown systemic crisis in 1997 following the failure\nof a number of high-proﬁle ﬁnancial institutions. Many of these banks and ﬁnancial\ninstitutions extended loans to builders and real estate developers at the height of\nthe asset bubble in the 1980s, with land as collateral. A number of these developers\ndefaulted after the asset bubble collapse, leaving the country’s banks saddled with\nbad debt and collateral worth sometimes 60% to 80% less than when the loans\nwere taken out. Due to the large size of these banking institutions and their role in\ncorporate funding, the crisis had profound effects on Japan and the global economy.\nEnormous bad debts, falling stock prices, and a collapsing real estate sector crippled\nJapan’s economy for more than two decades.\nIt was not until the rollout of Abenomics that the economy began to turn around.\nWhen Shinzo Abe became prime minister for the second time in 2012, he rolled out\na three-pronged plan to stimulate growth and pull the economy out of stagnation\nthrough monetary policy, ﬁscal policy, and economic growth strategies. This was\nknown as Abenomics . In the ﬁrst few weeks of the pr ogram, Abe announced a massive\nstimulus package that involved signiﬁcant government spending and a strong dose\nof quantitative easing. The effects were almost immediate, with the Japanese yen\nfalling signiﬁcantly across the board. Not soon after, the unemployment rate started\nto fall and growth slowly returned.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)241■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers\nMonetary policy in Japan is determined by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). In 1998, the\nJapanese government passed laws giving the BoJ operational independence from the\nMinistry of Finance (MoF) and complete control over monetary policy. However,\ndespite the government’s attempts to decen tralize decision making, the MoF still\nremains in charge of foreign exchange policy. The BoJ is responsible for executing\nall ofﬁcial Japanese foreign exchange transactions at the direction of the MoF. The\nBank of Japan’s Policy Board consists of the BoJ governor, two deputy governors,\nand six other members. Monetary policy meetings are held twice a month, with\nbrieﬁngs and press releases provided immediately. The BoJ also publishes a Monthly\nReport issued by the Policy Board, and a Monthly Economic Report . These reports\nare important to watch for changes in BoJ sentiment and signals of new monetary\nor ﬁscal policy measures, as the government is constantly trying to develop fresh\ninitiatives to stimulate growth.\nThe MoF and the BoJ are very important institutions, and they both can\ninﬂuence currency movements. Since the MoF is the director of foreign exchange\ninterventions, it is important to watch and keep abreast of the comments made\nfrom MoF ofﬁcials. Being an export driven economy, the government tends to favor\na weaker currency. So if the Japanese yen appreciates signiﬁcantly or too rapidly\nagainst the dollar, members of the BoJ and MoF will become increasingly vocal about\ntheir concerns or disapproval in regards to its current level or recent movements.\nThese comments can affect how the yen moves, but if government ofﬁcials ﬂood the\nmarket with comments and there is no follow-up action, the market would start\nto become immune to these concerns. However, the MoF and BoJ have a lengthy\nhistory of interventions in the currency markets to manipulate the value of the yen\nvalue in Japan’s best interests, so their comments cannot be completely ignored.\nThe most popular tool that the BoJ uses to control monetary policy is open\nmarket operations.\nOpen Market Operations\nThese activities are focused on controlling th e uncollateralized overnight call rate.\nThe Bank of Japan has maintained a zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) for some time\nnow, which means that the Bank of Japan cannot lower this rate further to stimulate\ngrowth, consumption, or liquidity. Therefore, in order to maintain zero interest\nrates, the BoJ has to manipulate liquidity through open market operations, targeting\nzero interest on the overnight call rate. It manipulates liquidity by the outright\nbuying or selling of bills, repos, or Japanese government bonds. A repo transaction\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)242involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider (lender), while\nagreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date.\nThis structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the\ncash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities,\nranging from one day to a few weeks.\nImportant Characteristics of the JPY\n■Proxy for Asian strength/weakness . Japan tends to be seen as a proxy for broad Asian\nstrength because the country has the largest GDP in Asia outside of China. With\nthe most developed capital markets, Japan was once the primary destination for\nall investors who wanted access into the region. Japan also conducts a signiﬁcant\namount of trade with its Asian partners. As a result, economic problems or\npolitical instability in Japan tend to spill over into the other Asian countries.\nHowever, this spillover is not one-sided. Economic or political problems in\nother Asian economies, particularly China, can also have dramatic impacts on\nthe Japanese economy and in turn movements in the Japanese yen. For example,\nNorth Korean political instability poses a great risk to Japan and the Japanese yen\ndue to the country’s geographic proximity.\n■Bank of Japan intervention practices . The BoJ and MoF are active participants in\nthe foreign exchange markets. That is, t hey have a lengthy history of entering\nthe FX markets if they are d issatisﬁed with the value of the Japanese yen. While\nthey have not intervened since 2011, they won’t be reluctant to do so if the\ncurrency strengthens signiﬁcantly. As Japan is a very political economy, with\nclose ties between government ofﬁcials and principals of large private institutions,\nthe MoF can have a very narrow segment in mind when it decides to intervene\nin the currency. Since the BoJ is such an active participant, it is very in tune\nwith the market movements and its participants. Periodically, the BoJ receives\ninformation on large hedge fund positions from banks and likes to intervene when\nspeculators are on the other side of the market, allowing them to get the most\n‘‘bang for the bucks.’’ The MoF and BoJ always considers three main factors\nbefore intervention:\n1.Amount of appreciation/depreciation in JPY —Intervention has historically\noccurred when the yen moves by 7 or more yen in less than 6 weeks. Using\nthe USDJPY as a barometer, 7 yen would be equivalent to 700 pips, which\nwould represent a move from 120.00 to 127.00.\n2.Current USDJPY rate —Historically, only 11% of all BoJ interventions that\nwere conducted to counter a strong JPY occurred above the 115 level.\n3.Speculative positions— In order to maximize the impact of intervention, the\nBoJ and MoF prefer to intervene when market participants hold massive\npositions in the opposing direction because the ﬂow of stops will exacerbate\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)243the reversal in the currency pair. The CFTC provides a weekly report on\nexisting speculative positions that can be found at www.cftc.gov.\n■JPY movements are sensitive to time . The Japanese yen can be particularly active\ntowards the end of Japan’s ﬁscal year (March 31), as exporters repatriate their\ndollar denominated assets to window dress their balance sheets. This is particularly\nimportant for Japanese banks because they need to rebuild their balance sheets\nto meet FSA guidelines that require the banks to mark to market their security\nholdings. In anticipation of the need for repatriation-related purchases, Japanese\nyen speculators frequently bid the yen higher in attempt to take advantage of this\nincreased inﬂow. As a result, following ﬁscal year end, the Japanese yen tends to\nhave a bias toward depreciation as speculators close their positions.\nAside from the ﬁscal year end, time is also a factor on a day-to-day basis.\nUnlike traders in London or New York who typically have lunch at their trading\ndesk, Japanese traders tend to take hour-long lunches, leaving only a junior trader\nin the ofﬁce. On occasion, this can translate into additional volatility in the yen\nduring this period as the market becomes illiquid. In addition to this period, the\nJPY tends to move fairly orderly during Japanese and London hours, unless there\nare ofﬁcial comments or major surprises in economic data. During U.S. hours,\nhowever, the JPY tends to have higher volatility, as U.S. traders are actively\nengaging in dollar and yen positions.\n■Stocks and bonds have a positive correlation with USDJPY . The Nikkei has a positive\ncorrelation with USDJPY, which means that when the currency pair appreciating,\nequities are generally on the rise as well. For Japan, the currency typically leads\nequities because a weak yen is positive for the economy, but there can be times\nwhen equities lead currencies. The spread between U.S. 10-year Treasury and\nJGB yields is also very important for the currency. Typically, when the yield\nspread is on the rise, we see USDJPY move higher, and when the yield spread\ndeclines, it creates pressure on USDJPY. Figure 30.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of USDJPY.\n■Carry trade effects . The popularity of carry trades has increased in recent years, as\ninvestors are actively seeking high-yielding assets. With the Japanese yen having\nthe lowest interest rate of all industrialized countries, it is the primary currency\nsold or borrowed in carry trades. The most popular carry trade currencies\nincluded GBPJPY, AUDJPY, NZDJPY, and even USDJPY. Carry traders would\ngo short the Japanese yen against the higher yielding currencies. Unwinding of\ncarry trades as result of spread narrowing is typically beneﬁcial for the Japanese\nyen, as the reversal process involves purchasing the yen and buying back other\ncurrencies. Since there is so much demand to sell the yen for carry, in periods of\nrisk aversion, these trades can be unwound quickly creating a signiﬁcant rally in\nthe currency.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)244■Important Economic Indicators for Japan\nSince Japan is a manufacturing-oriented economy, manufacturing data tend to have\nthe most signiﬁcant impact on the yen. However, on a monthly basis, unless there is\na big surprise, Japanese data do not typically move the currency. The most inﬂuential\nevent risk is always the monetary policy announcement and trade balance. Aside\nfrom that, these are the numbers to watch.\nTankan Survey\nIf there is one piece of Japanese data to follow, it should be the quarterly Tankan\nReport. The Tankan is an economic survey of Japanese enterprises published four\ntimes a year. The survey includes more than 9,000 enterprises, which are divided\ninto four major groups: large, small, and medium-sized companies, as well as\nprincipal enterprises. The survey provides us with an overall impression of the\nbusiness climate in Japan and is widely watched and anticipated by foreign exchange\nmarket participants.\nBalance of Payments\nThe monthly balance of payments report provides investors with insight into Japan’s\ninternational economic transactions that include goods, services, investment income,\nand capital ﬂows. The current account side of BoJ can be used a good gauge of\ninternational trade. Figures are released on a monthly and semiannual basis.\nEmployment\nEmployment ﬁgures are reported on a monthly basis by the Management and\nCoordination Agency of Japan. The employment release measures the number of\njobs and unemployment rate for the country as a whole. The data are obtained\nthrough a statistical survey of the current labor force. This release is a closely\nwatched economic indicator because of its timeliness and its importance as a leading\nindicator of economic activity.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures trends in the output of Japanese\nmanufacturing, mining, and utilities companies. Output refers to the total quantity\nof items produced. The index covers the production of goods for domestic sales\nin Japan and for export. It excludes production in the agriculture, construction,\ntransportation, communication, trade, ﬁnance, and service industries; government\noutput; and imports. The IP index is then developed by weighting each component\naccording to its relative importance during this base period. Investors feel IP and\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)\nk\nk245\nk\nk\nFIGURE 30.1 USDJPY 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)246inventory accumulation have strong correlations with total output and can provide\nvaluable insight into the current state of the economy.\nGDP\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a broad measure of the total production and\nconsumption of goods and services measured over quarterly and yearly periods in\nJapan. GDP is measured by adding total expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. Preliminary reports\nare the most signiﬁcant for FX market participants.\n247CHAPTER 31\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nAustralian Dollar\n(AUD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nAustralia is the twelfth largest country in the world, with a gross domestic product\nof approximately US$1.5 trillion. In Asia, it ranks as the third largest economy\nin the region. On a relative basis, the economy is very small, only one-tenth\nthat of the United States and less than one-ﬁfth the size of China. However on a\nper capita basis, Australia ranks right up there with many industrialized Western\nEuropean countries. Australia has a service-oriented economy with close to 70%\nof GDP coming from industries such as ﬁnance, property, and business services.\nHowever, the country has a trade deﬁcit, with manufacturing dominating the\ncountry’s exporting activities. Rural and mineral exports account for over 60% of all\nmanufacturing exports and 12% of GDP. The economy is therefore highly sensitive\nto changes in commodity prices. As a country heavily dependent on exports, the\npace of growth of Australia’s largest trade partners is extremely important because\ndownturns or rapid growth abroad can impact import and export demand. Here’s a\nbreakdown of Australia’s most important trading partners:\nL a r g e s tE x p o r tM a r k e t s\n1. China\n2. Japan\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)2483. South Korea\n4. United States\n5. New Zealand\nLargest Import Sources\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. Japan\n4. Singapore\n5. Germany\nAs you can see, Australia’s number one trading partner is China. In fact, Chinese\ndemand represents a third of the country’s trade activity. In terms of products, the\nChinese are major importers of Australian iron ore, coal, natural gas, and gold.\nAsia Pac is extremely important to Australia, as more than 70% of its exports are\ndestined for countries within the region. This makes Australia’s economy highly\nsensitive to the performance of countries in the Asian Paciﬁc region. Hiccups in\nChina’s economy can have a signiﬁcant impact on Australia, not only in terms of\nexporting activities but also on housing market activity. At the same time, growth in\nChina is positive for Australia’s economy. During the global ﬁnancial crisis, exports\nto China helped shelter Australia from a major downturn. The relationship between\nChina and Australia is known as Sino-Australian relations. China has recently taken\nsteps to produce its own resources, and if this trend continues, it could dramatically\nchange the landscape of Australia’s economy.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is the central bank of Australia. The monetary\npolicy committee within the central bank consists of the governor (chairman), the\ndeputy governor (vice chairman), secretary to the treasurer, and six independent\nmembers appointed by the government. Changes to monetary policy are made on\nconsensus within the committee.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nThe RBA’s charter states t hat the mandate of the Reserve Bank Board is to focus\nmonetary and banking policy on ensuring:\n1. The stability of the currency of Australia;\n2. The maintenance of full employment in Australia; and\n3. The economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)249In order to achieve these objectives, the government has set an informal consumer\nprice inﬂation target of 2% to 3% per year. The RBA believes that the key to long-\nterm sustainable growth in the economy is to control inﬂation, which would preserve\nthe value of money. In addition, an inﬂation target provides a discipline for monetary\npolicy making and guidelines for private-sector inﬂation expectations. This also\nincreases the transparency of the banks’ activities. Should inﬂation or inﬂation\nexpectations exceed the 2% to 3% target, traders should know that it would raise\nred ﬂags at the RBA and prompt the central bank to favor a tighter monetary policy\nor, in the other words, further rate hikes.\nMonetary policy decisions involve setting the interest rate on overnight loans\nin the money market. Other interest rates in the economy are inﬂuenced by this\ninterest rate to varying degrees, so that the behavior of borrowers and lenders in\nthe ﬁnancial markets is affected by monetary policy (though not only by monetary\npolicy). Through these channels, monetary policy affects the economy in pursuit of\nthe goals just outlined.\nCash Rate\nThe cash rate is the RBA’s target rate for open market operations and is the rate\ncharged on overnight loans between ﬁnancial intermediaries. This means the cash\nrate should have a close relationship with the prevailing money market interest rates.\nChanges in monetary policy directly affect the interest rate structure of the ﬁnancial\nsystem. They also affect sentiment in a currency. Figure 31.1 graphs the AUDUSD\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.01. 2\n1. 1\n1. 0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n6/4/10 6/4/11 6/4/12AUDUSD vs. AU-US 10 Year Spread\n6/4/13 6/4/14 6/4/15\nAU-US Spread AUDUSD\nFIGURE 31.1 AUDUSD vs. 10-Year Yield Spread\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)250against the interest rate differential between Australia and the United States between\n2010 and 2015. There is clearly a positive c orrelation between the 10-year yield\nspread and the currency. Between June 2014 and June 2015, for example, the yield\nspread dropped from 1.5% to 0.5%, and thi s coincided with a drop in the AUDUSD\nfrom 95 to 76 cents.\nMaintaining the Cash Rate: Open Market Operations\nThe focus of daily open market operations is to keep the cash rate close to the target,\nby managing money market liquidity provided to commercial banks. If the Reserve\nBank wishes to decrease the cash rate, it would increase supply of short-dated\nrepurchase agreements at a lower interest rate than the prevailing cash rate, which\nwould in essence decrease the cash rate. If the Reserve Bank wishes to increase\nthe cash rate, it would decrease supply of short-dated repurchase agreements,\nwhich would increase the cash rate. A repurchase agreement involves a cash taker\n(commercial bank) selling securities to a cash provider (RBA), while agreeing to\nrepurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date. This structure\nis similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the cash provider\ninterest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities, ranging from\none day to a few weeks.\nAustralia has had a ﬂoating exchange rate since 1983, and the Reserve Bank\nof Australia may undertake foreign exchange market operations when the market\nthreatens to become excessively volatile or when the exchange rate is clearly\ninconsistent with underlying economic fundamentals. The RBA monitors a trade-\nweighted index (TWI), as well as the cross-rate with the U.S. dollar. Intervention\noperations are invariably aimed at stabilizing market conditions rather than meeting\nexchange rate targets.\nMonetary Policy Meetings\nThe RBA meets every month (except for January), on the ﬁrst Tuesday of each\nmonth, to discuss potential changes in monetary policy. Following each meeting, the\nRBA issues a press release outlining justiﬁcations for its monetary policy changes.\nIf it leaves rates unchanged, no statement is published. The RBA also publishes a\nmonthly Reserve Bank Bulletin . The May and November issues of the Reserve Bank\nBulletin include the semiannual statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy. The\nFebruary, May, August, and November issues contain a Quarterly Report on the\nEconomy and Financial Markets. It is important to read these bulletins for signals on\npotential monetary policy changes.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)251Important Characteristics of the Australian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . Historically, the Australian dollar has had a very strongly\ncorrelation (approximately 80%) with commodity prices and, more speciﬁcally,\ngold and iron ore prices. The correlation stems from the fact that Australia is\nthe world’s second largest gold producer and the world’s largest producer of\niron ore. Therefore, the price of iron ore and gold is extremely important to\nAustralia’s economy. However, unless there is a sharp movement in gold or\niron ore prices, it generally takes time for the AUDUSD to adjust to changes in\nthe price of commodities. Generally speaking, if commodity prices are strong,\ninﬂationary fears start to appear, and the RBA would be inclined to raise rates to\ncurb inﬂation. However, this is a sensitive topic, as gold prices tend to increase\nin times of global economic or political uncertainty. If the RBA increases rates\nduring those conditions, it leaves Australia more vulnerable to spillover effects.\n■Carry trade effects . Australia has one of highest interest rates among the developed\ncountries. With a fairly liquid currency, the Australian dollar is one of the most\npopular currencies to use for carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or\nlending a currency with a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency\nwith a low interest rate. The popularity of the carry trade has contributed to the\n57% rise of the Australian dollar aga inst the U.S. dolla r between 2001 and 2005.\nWhile the carry trade suffered great ly in 2008, it came back strongly between\n2009 and 2011. During this time, many foreign investors were looking for high\nyield when equity investments offered minimal returns. However, carry trades\nonly last as long as the actual yield advantage remains. If global central banks\nincrease their interest rates and the positive interest rate differential between\nAustralia and other countries narro w, the AUDUSD could s uffer from an exodus\nof carry traders.\n■Drought effects . Since the majority of Australia’s exports are commodities, the\ncountry’s GDP is highly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage\nthe country’s farming activities. For example, 2002 was a particularly difﬁcult\nyear for Australia, because the country was experiencing a severe drought. The\ndrought took an extreme toll on Australia’s farming activities, with dry conditions\nhampering the economy throughout the twenty-ﬁrst century. This is important\nbecause agriculture accounts for 3% of the country’s GDP. The RBA estimates\nthat the ‘‘decline in farm production could directly reduce GDP growth by\naround 1 percentage point.’’ Aside from exporting activities, a drought also has\nindirect effects on other aspects of Australia’s economy. Industries that supply and\nservice agriculture, such as the wholesale and transport sectors, as well as retail\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)252operations in rural farming areas, may also be negatively affected by a drought.\nHowever, it is also important to note that the Australian economy has a history\nof recovering strongly after a drought. The 1982–1983 drought ﬁrst subtracted\nthen subsequently added around 1% to 1 1∕2% to GDP growth. The 1991–1995\ndrought reduced GDP by around 1∕2to3∕4percentage points in 1991–1992 and\n1994–1995, but the recovery boosted GDP by 3∕4percentage points.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of Australia\nand the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries should\nalso be closely watched by Australian dollar traders. These differentials can be\ngood indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much premium\nyield Australian dollar short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Australia\nGDP\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services\nin Australia. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Australia ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth generally coincides with a\nweak growth period.\nCPI\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a basket\nof goods and services, which account for a high proportion of expenditure by the\nCPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation, and\nhealth. This is an important indicator to watch, as it is a key input for monetary\npolicy decisions.\nBalance of Goods and Services\nThis number is a monthly measure of Australia’s international trade in goods and\nservices on a balance of payments basis. General merchandise imports and exports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)\nk\nk253\nk\nk\nFIGURE 31.2 AUDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)254are derived mainly from international trade statistics, which are based on Australian\nCustoms Service records. The current account is the balance of trade plus services.\nPrivate Consumption\nThis is a national accounts measure that reﬂects current expenditure by households\nand producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes purchases of\ndurable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure by persons\non the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by unincorporated\nenterprises. This number is important to watch, as private consumption or consumer\nconsumption is the foundation for resilience in the Australian economy.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average\nchanges in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI\ntracks changes in prices for nearly every goods-producing industry in the domestic\neconomy, including agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries,\nmanufacturing, and mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally\nadjusted ﬁnished goods PPI and how the index has reacted on an m/m, q/q, h/h\nand y/y basis. Australia’s PPI data are released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 31.2 illustrates the 10 year performance of AUDUSD.\n255CHAPTER 32\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nNew Zealand Dollar\n(NZD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nNew Zealand is a very small economy with GDP valued at approximately\nUS$183 billion in 2013. In fact, there are less people living in New Zealand\nthan in New York City. It was once one of the most regulated countries within\nthe OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), but over\nthe past two decades the country has been moving toward a more open, modern,\nand stable economy. With the passing of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994, the\ncountry is shifting from an agricultural farming community to one that seeks to\nbecome a leading knowledge-based economy with high skills, high employment,\nand high value-added production. This act sets legal standards that hold the govern-\nment formally responsible to the public for its ﬁscal performance. It also sets the\nframework for the country’s macroeconomic policies. The following are the ﬁve\nprinciples outlined under the Fiscal Responsibility Act:\n1. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; by achieving surpluses on the\noperating budget every year until such a level is reached.\n2. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; and the government must ensure\nthat expenditure is lower than revenue.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)2563. Sufﬁcient levels of Crown net worth must be achieved and maintained to guard\nagainst adverse future events.\n4. Reasonable taxation policies must be followed.\n5. Fiscal risks facing the government must be prudently managed.\nNew Zealand also has highly developed manufacturing and services sectors,\nwith the agricultural industry driving the bulk of the country’s exports. The\neconomy is strongly trade-oriented, with exports of goods and services representing\napproximately one third of GDP. Due to the small size of the economy and its\nsigniﬁcant trade activities, New Zealand is highly sensitive to global performance,\nespecially of its key Asian trading partners, Australia, China, United States, and Japan.\nTogether, Australia, China, and Japan represent 42% of New Zealand’s trading\nactivity. It is also extremely sensitive to exchange rate ﬂuctuations, particularly\nagainst the Australian dollar. The fo llowing lists are a breakdown of the New\nZealand’s most important trading partners:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Australia\n2. China\n3. European Union\n4. United States\n5. Japan\nLeading Import Sources\n1. European Union\n2. China\n3. Australia\n4. United States\n5. Japan\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Reserve\nBank of New Zealand\nMonetary policy in New Zealand is determined by the Reserve Bank (RBNZ).\nThe Monetary Policy Committee is an internal committee of bank executives who\nreview monetary policy on a weekly basis. Meetings to decide on changes to\nmonetary policy occur eight ti mes a year, or approximate ly every six weeks. Unlike\nmost other central banks, the decision for rate changes rests ultimately on the bank’s\ngovernor. The current policy target agreements set by the minister and the governor\nfocus on maintaining policy stability and avoiding unnecessary instability in output,\ninterest rates, and the exchange rate. Price stability refers to maintaining the annual\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)257CPI inﬂation at 1.5%. If the RBNZ does not meet this target, the government has\nthe ability to dismiss the governor of the RBNZ. This is rarely done, but this serves\nas a strong incentive for the RBNZ to meets its inﬂation target. The most common\ntools used by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy changes are the following.\nOfﬁcial Cash Rate (OCR)\nThe Ofﬁcial Cash Rate is the rate set by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy.\nThe Bank lends overnight cash at 25 basis points above the OCR rate and receives\ndeposits or pays interest at 25 basis points below this rate. By controlling the cost\nof liquidity for commercial banks, the RBNZ can inﬂuence the interest rates offered\nto individuals and corporations. This effectively creates a 50 basis point corridor\nthat bounds the interbank overnight rate. The idea is then that banks offering funds\nabove the upper bound will attract few takers, because funds can be borrowed for\na lower cost from the RBNZ. Also, banks offering rates below the lower bound\nwill also attract few takers, because they are offering lower yields than the RBNZ.\nThe ofﬁcial cash rate is reviewed and manipulated with the goal of maintaining\neconomic stability.\nObjectives for Fiscal Policy\nOpen market operations on the other hand are used to meet the cash target. The\ncash target is the targeted amount of reserves held by registered banks. The RBNZ\nprepares forecasts of daily ﬂuctuations on the cash target and will then use these\nforecasts to determine the amount of funds to inject or withdraw in order to meet\nthe cash target. The following government objectives provide a guideline for ﬁscal\nand monetary policy measures:\n■Expenses : Expenses will average around 35% of GDP over the horizon used to\ncalculate contributions toward future New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) costs.\nDuring the buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs, expenses plus contributions\nwill be around 35% of GDP. In the longer term, expenses less withdrawals to\nmeet NZS costs will be around 35% of GDP.\n■Revenue : Raise sufﬁcient revenue to meet the operating balance objective. A\nrobust, broad-based tax system that raises revenue in a fair and efﬁcient way.\n■Operating balance : Operating surplus on average over the economic cycle sufﬁcient\nto meet the requirements for contributions toward future NZS costs and ensure\nconsistency with the debt objective.\n■Debt: Gross debt below 30% of GDP on average over the economic cycle. Net\ndebt, which excludes the assets to meet future NZS costs, below 20% of GDP on\naverage over the economic cycle.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)258■Net worth : Increase net worth consistent with the operating balance objective.\nThis will be achieved through a buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs.\nSource: New Zealand Treasury\n■Important Characteristics of the New Zealand\nDollar\nStrong Correlation with AUD—Competition with Australia\nAustralia is New Zealand’s largest trading partner. This coupled with their geographic\nproximity and New Zealand’s high dependence on trade, creates strong ties between\nthe economies of the two countries. When the Australian economy is healthy and\nAustralian corporations increase their importing activities, New Zealand will be one\nof the ﬁrst to beneﬁt. When it is weak, New Zealand suffers but in recent years\nits sensitivity has diminished because of the country’s growing trade with China\nand other nations. Nonetheless, 22% of trade is still conducted with Australia,\nand this explains why there is a positive correlation between the two currencies.\nFigure 32.1 shows how closely AUDUS D and NZDUSD have moved between 2005\nand 2015.\nCommodity-Linked Currency\nNew Zealand is an export driven economy with commodities representing over\n40% of the country’s exports, and as a result the New Zealand dollar has a strong\ncorrelation with commodity prices, particularly dairy. Fonterra is one of the world’s\n1. 2\n1. 1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.4AUDUSD vs. NZDUSD\n6/30/05 6/30/06 6/30/07 6/30/08 6/30/09 6/30/10 6/30/11 6/30/12 6/30/13 6/30/140.5\nAUDUSD NZDUSD\nFIGURE 32.1 AUDUSD versus NZDUSD\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)259leading dairy producer and also largest company in New Zealand. Twice a month\nthe Global Dairy Trade will conduct an auction and if prices rise, it will be positive\nfor the New Zealand dollar. If prices fall, it will be negative for the currency\nbecause it can mean reduced payout and proﬁt for dairy producers. The correlation\nbetween Australian and New Zealand dollars also contributes to the NZD’s status as a\n‘‘commodity linked’’ currency. Therefore, the New Zealand dollar’s correlation with\ncommodity prices is not only limited to its own trade activities. Therefore, as com-\nmodity prices increase, the Australian economy beneﬁts, translating into increased\nactivity in all aspects of the country’s operations, including trade with New Zealand.\nCarry Trades\nOf the industrialized countries, New Zealand tends to maintain the highest interest\nrate as it needs to offer investors a higher yield to compensate for the risk of\ninvesting in a small economy. This yield advantage along with its secure credit rating\nhas made the New Zealand dollar one of the most popular currencies to purchase\nfor carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. The\npopularity of the carry trade has contributed to the rise of the New Zealand dollar in\nan environment where many global investors are looking for opportunities to earn\nhigh yield. However, this also makes the New Zealand dollar particularly sensitive\nto changes in interest rates. That is, when the United States begins increasing their\ninterest rates, while New Zealand stays on hold or reduces their interest rates, the\ncarry advantage of the New Zealand dollar would narrow. In such situations, the\nNew Zealand dollar could come under pressure as speculators reverse their carry\ntrade positions.\nInterest Rate Differentials\nInterest rate differentials between the cash rates of New Zealand and the short\nterm interest rate yields of other industrialized countries are closely watched by\nprofessional NZD traders. These differentials can be good indicators of potential\nmoney ﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield NZD short-term ﬁxed-\nincome assets are offering over foreign short-term ﬁxed income assets, or vice versa.\nThis differential provides traders with indications of potential currency movements,\nas investors are always looking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly\nimportant to carry traders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive\ninterest rate differentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\nPopulation Migration\nAs mentioned earlier, New Zealand has a very small population, less than half of\nNew York City. Therefore, changes in migration can have signiﬁcant effects on the\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)260economy. Between 2013 an d 2014, the population of New Zealand increased by\n78,800 people, which was the largest net migration in at least 90 years. Between\n2011 and 2012, for example, the population only grew by 26,400 people. Although\nthese absolute numbers appear small, it is fairly signiﬁcant for New Zealand because\nof the size of the population. In fact, this strong population migration into New\nZealand has contributed signiﬁcantly to the performance of the economy, because\nas the population increases, the demand for household goods increases, leading to\nan increase in overall consumer consumption.\nDrought Effects\nSince the bulk of New Zealand’s exports are commodities, the country’s GDP is\nhighly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage the country’s farming\nactivities. In 2013, droughts cost the country over $1.3 billion. In addition, droughts\nare also very frequent in Australia, New Zealand’s largest trading partner, and when\nthey occur it can have a negative impact on the New Zealand economy.\n■Important Economic Indicators for New Zealand\nNew Zealand does not release economic indicators often; however, when they do,\nthe following items are the most important:\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a quarterly measure of the total production and consumption of goods and\nservices in New Zealand. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households,\nbusinesses, government, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used\nto convert output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. This data are\nused to gauge where in the business cycle New Zealand ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often\nis perceived inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nConsumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a\n‘‘basket’’ of goods and services that account for a high proportion of expenditure by\nthe CPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation,\nand health. This is an important indicator to watch, as monetary policy changes are\nhighly inﬂuenced by this index as it is a measure of inﬂation.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)\nk\nk261\nk\nk\nFIGURE 32.2 NZDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)262Balance of Goods and Services\nNew Zealand’s Balance of Payments statements are records of the value of New\nZealand’s transactions in goods, services, income, and transfers with the rest of the\nworld, and the changes in New Zealand’s ﬁnancial claims on (assets), and liabilities\nto, the rest of the world. New Zealand’s International Investment Position statement\nshows, at a particular point in time, the stock of a country’s international ﬁnancial\nassets and international ﬁnancial liabilities.\nRetail Sales Ex Inﬂation\nCredit card spending numbers are released for New Zealand on a monthly basis but\nthe retail sales data is quarterly on an ex inﬂation basis. This measure tracks the\nresale of new and used goods to the public for personal or household consumption.\nIt is also an important input into GDP.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a m/m, q/q, h/h, and y/y basis. New\nZealand’s PPI data is released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 32.2 illustrates the 10-year performance of NZDUSD.\n263CHAPTER 33\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nCanadian Dollar\n(CAD)\n■Broad Economic Performance\nCanada is the world’s eleventh largest country with GDP valued at US$1.8 trillion as\nof 2014. As a resource-based economy, the country’s early economic development\nhinged on the development, exploitation, and exports of natural resources. It is\nnow the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold. However, in actuality,\nnearly two-thirds of the country’s GDP comes from the service sector, which also\nemploys three out of four Canadians. The strength in the service sector is partly\nattributed to the trend by businesses to subcontract a large portion of their services.\nThis may include a manufacturing company subcontracting delivery services to a\ntransportation company. Despite this, manufacturing and resources are still very\nimportant for the Canadian economy, as it represents over 25% of the country’s\nexports and is a primary source of income for a number of provinces.\nThe Canadian economy started to advance with the depreciation of its currency\nagainst the U.S. dollar and the Free Trade Agreement that came into effect in January\n1989. This agreement eliminated almost all trade tariffs between the United States\nand Canada. As a result, Canada now exports over 85% of its goods to the United\nStates. Further negotiations to incorporate Mexico created the North American Free\nTrade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect on January 1994. This more advanced\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)264treaty eliminated most tariffs on trading b etween all three countries. Canada’s close\ntrade relationship with the United States makes it particularly sensitive to the health\nof the U.S. economy. If the U.S. economy sputters, demand for Canadian exports\nwould suffer. The same is true for the opposite scenario; if U.S. economic growth\nis robust, Canadian exports will beneﬁt. In the past decade, trade with China has\nalso increased signiﬁcantly, rising in the ranks from the ﬁfth to the second most\nimportant trade partner for Canada. The following is a breakdown of Canada’s key\nexport and import markets:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. United Kingdom\n4. Japan\n5. Mexico\nLeading Import Sources\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Japan\n4. Mexico\n5. United Kingdom\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Governing Council of the Bank of Canada is the board that is responsible for\nsetting Canadian monetary policy. This council consists of seven members: the\ngovernor and six deputy governors. The Bank of Canada meets approximately eight\ntimes per year to discuss changes in monetary policy. They also release a monthly\nmonetary policy update every quarter, but the rate decision itself is the big market\nmover for the currency.\nCentral Bank Goals\nThe Bank of Canada’s primary focus is on maintaining the ‘‘integrity and value of\nthe currency,’’ and this involves ensuring pri ce stability. Price stability is maintained\nby adhering to an inﬂation target currently set by the Department of Finance at\n1% to 3%. The Bank believes that high inﬂation can damage the functioning of the\neconomy. In their opinion, low inﬂation on the other hand equates to price stability,\nwhich can help to foster sustainable long-term economic growth. The BoC controls\ninﬂation through short-term interest rates. If inﬂation is above the target, the Bank\nwill apply tighter monetary conditions. If it is below the target, the Bank will loosen\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)265monetary policy. Overall, the central bank has done a pretty good job of keeping\nthe inﬂation target within the band since 1998.\nThe Bank measures monetary conditions using its Monetary Conditions Index,\nwhich is a weighted sum of changes in the 90-day commercial paper rate and G-10\ntrade-weighted exchange rates. The weight of the interest rate versus the exchange\nrate is 3 to 1, which is the affect of a chan ge in interest rates on the exchange rate\nbased on historical studies. This means that a 1% increase in short-term interest\nrates is the same as a 3% appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate. To\nchange monetary policy, the BoC manipulates the Bank Rate, which can in turn\naffect the exchange rate. If the currency appreciates to undesirable levels, the BoC\ncan decrease interest rates to offset the rise. If it depreciates, the BoC can raise rates.\nHowever, interest rate changes are not used for the purposes of manipulating the\nexchange rate. Instead, they are used to control inﬂation but an excessively strong\ncurrency and lower inﬂationary pressures can accelerate the changes. The following\nare the most commonly used tools by the BoC to implement monetary policy.\nBank Rate\nThe Bank Rate is the main rate used to control inﬂation. This is the rate of interest\nthat the Bank of Canada charges to commercial banks. Changes to this rate will affect\nother interest rates, including mortgage rates and prime rates charged by commercial\nbanks. Therefore, changes to this rate will ﬁlter into the overall economy.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) is the framework for the Bank of Canada’s\nimplementation of monetary policy. It is through this framework that Canada’s\ncommercial banks borrow and lend overnight money to each other in order to fund\ntheir daily transactions. The LVTS is an electronic platform through which these\nﬁnancial institutions conduct large transactions. The interest rate charged on these\novernight loans is called the overnight rate or bank rate. The BoC can manipulate the\novernight rate by offering to lend at rates lower or higher than the current market\nrate if the overnight lending rate is trading above or below the target banks.\nOn a regular basis, the bank releases a number of publications that are important to\nfollow. This includes a biannual Monetary Policy Report that contains an assessment of\nthe current economic environment and implications for inﬂation and a quarterly Bank\nof Canada Review that includes economic commentary, featured articles, speeches by\nmembers of the Governing Council, and important announcements.\nImportant Characteristics of the Canadian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . As the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold,\nCanada’s economy is highly dependent on commodities. This creates a strong\npositive correlation between the Canadian dollar and oil prices. Generally\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)266speaking, when oil prices rise, it beneﬁts domestic producers and increases their\nincome from exports. However at the same time, strong commodity prices can\nhurt growth abroad; so while rising oil prices are initially positive for Canada,\nthe negative impact on global growth could lead to a decline in demand over the\nmedium term. On the ﬂip side, falling oil prices are negative for the Canadian\ndollar; but if prices remain low and global growth beneﬁts, it can eventually\nneutralize the negative impact.\n■Strong correlation with the United States . Since the 1980s, Canada has been running\nmerchandise trade surpluses with the United States and now approximately 77%\nof Canadian exports are bound for the Untied States. This heavy reliance on U.S.,\ndemand makes Canada extremely sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy. As the\nU.S. economy accelerates, trade increases with Canadian companies, lifting overall\neconomic activity. However, as the U.S. economy slows, the Canadian economy\nwill be hurt signiﬁcantly as U.S. companies reduce their importing activities.\n■Mergers and acquisitions . Due to the proximity of the United States and Canada,\ncross-border mergers and acquisitions are very common, as companies worldwide\nstrive for globalization. These mergers and acquisitions lead to money ﬂowing\nbetween the two countries, which ulti mately impacts the currencies. In 2001,\nthe signiﬁcant U.S. acquisition of Canadian energy companies infused US$25\nbillion into Canada. This led to a strong rally in USDCAD, as the U.S. companies\nneeded to sell USD and buy CAD to pay for their acquisitions. Any similar type\nof M&A ﬂow in the future will also have a signiﬁcant but short-term impact on\nthe Canadian dollar.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of\nCanada and the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries\nare closely watched by professional Canadian dollar traders. These differentials\ncan be good indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much\npremium yield Canadian short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, and vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Carry trades . A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. When\nCanada has a higher interest rate than th e United States, the short USDCAD carry\ntrade becomes more attractive; but if th e United States emba rks on a tightening\ncampaign or Canada lowers rates, the positive interest rate differential between\nthe Canadian dollar and other currencies would narrow. In such situations, the\nCanadian dollar could come under pressure if the speculators begin to exit out of\ntheir carry trades.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)267■Important Economic Indicators for Canada\nCanadian economic reports can have a signiﬁcant impact on the currency. Here are\na handful of the most important releases.\nCanadian Employment\nEvery month, Canada releases its labor market report and this report provides more\ndetails than that of the United States. Job growth is expressed as net job growth and\nthen split into full- and part-time hirers. Generally speaking, the market prefers that\nthe bulk of job growth is full time, because it represents real long-term employment\nand not short-term hires that can be laid off at any time. The unemployment rate is\nalso released, and the number of unemployed persons is expressed as a percentage\nof the labor force.\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\nThe monthly consumer price report measures the average rate of increase in prices.\nWhen economists speak of inﬂation as an economic problem, they generally mean\na persistent increase in the general price level over a period of time, resulting in a\ndecline in a currency’s purchasing power. Inﬂation is often measured as a percentage\nincrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Canada’s inﬂation policy, as set out\nby the federal government and the Bank of Canada, aims to keep inﬂation within\na target range of 1% to 3%. If the rate of inﬂation is 10% a year, $100 worth of\npurchases last year will, on average, cost $110 this year. At the same inﬂation rate,\nthose purchases will cost $121 next year, and so on.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nThe gross domestic product measures the total value of all goods and services\nproduced within Canada during a given year. It is a measure of the income generated\nby production within Canada. GDP is also referred to as economic output. To\navoid counting the same output more than once, GDP includes only ﬁnal goods\nand services—not those that are used to make another product. For example, GDP\nwould not include the wheat used to make bread, but would include the bread itself.\nTrade Balance\nThe balance of trade is a statement of a country’s trade in goods (merchandise) and\nservices. It covers trade in products such as manufactured goods, raw materials, and\nagricultural goods, as well as travel and transportation. The balance of trade is the\ndifference between the value of the goods and services that a country exports and\nthe value of the goods and services that it imports. If a country’s exports exceed its\nimports, it has a trade surplus and the trade balance is said to be positive. If imports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)268\nFIGURE 33.1 USDCAD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nexceed exports, the country has a trade deﬁcit, and its trade balance is said to be\nnegative.\nRetail Sales\nRetail sales is a monthly national accounts measure that calculates current expenditure\nby households and producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes\npurchases of durable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure\nby persons on the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by\nunincorporated enterprises. Stronger consumer spending is positive for Canada’s\neconomy and, in turn, the Canadian dollar, whereas weaker consumer spending is\nnegative for Canada’s economy and currency.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.\nFigure 33.1 illustrates the 10-year

        "213CHAPTER 27\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nEuro (EUR)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe European Union (EU) was developed as an institutional framework for the\nconstruction of a united Europe. As of May 2015, the EU consists of 28 member\ncountries with 19 of these nations sharing the euro as a common currency. The\nEurozone consists of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,\nGreece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,\nPortugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. With the exception of Denmark and the\nUnited Kingdom, other EU states are obliged to join the monetary union when they\nmeet the criteria to do so. Aside from a common currency, these countries also\nshare a single monetary policy dictated by the European Central Bank (ECB). These\ncommon currency countries constitute the European Monetary Union (EMU).\nThe EMU is the world’s second largest economic power, with gross domestic\nproduct valued at approximately US$18 trillion in 2014. With a highly developed\nﬁxed income, equity, and futures market, the EMU is the second most attractive\ninvestment market for domestic and international investors. In its early days, the\nEMU found difﬁculty attracting foreign direct investment or large capital ﬂows\nbecause, historically, the U.S. markets are larger with more consistent returns. As\na result, the U.S. absorbs 71% of total foreign savings. However, with the euro\nbecoming an established currency and the European Monetary Union incorporating\nmore members, the euro’s importance as a reserve currency is rising and translating\ninto greater capital ﬂows. The only problem is that European bond markets are\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)214fragmented, and there are not enough quality assets for central banks to invest in.\nUnless there are euro bonds, foreign central banks could be slow to diversify their\nreserve holdings. Nonetheless, they will do so gradually, providing ongoing support\nfor the euro.\nTrade is extremely important to Eurozone nations and most countries conduct\nthe majority of their trade with other states in the region. This is important because\none of the most valuable aspects of the euro is its facilitation of trade activity through\nthe elimination of exchange rate risk. Large Eurozone nations such as Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Spain also conduct signiﬁcant trade activity with countries like the\nUnited States and China. This makes the value of the euro particularly important\nto economic activity. A country like the United States is less sensitive to exchange\nrate ﬂuctuations because most of its demand is internal, but Europe is extremely\nsensitive to its exchange rate because many Eurozone nations rely on external\ndemand. The size and scope of the EMU’s trade with the rest of the world provides\nit with signiﬁcant power in the international trade arena. International clout is also\none of the primary goals in the formation of the European Union, because it allows\nindividual nations to negotiate as a group on an equal playing ﬁeld with the United\nStates and China, their two largest trading partners. The breakdowns of the most\nimportant trading partners for the European Union are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Switzerland\n4. Russia\n5. Turkey\nLeading Import Sources\n1. China\n2. Russia\n3. United States\n4. Norway\n5. Switzerland\nWhile trade is extremely important, the service sector has the largest share of\ntotal output followed by manufacturing. In fact, a large number of the companies\nwhose primary purpose is to produce ﬁnished products still concentrate their EU\nactivity on innovation, research, design, and marketing, while outsourcing most of\ntheir manufacturing activities to Asia.\nThe EU’s growing role in international trade has major implications for the role of\nthe euro as a reserve currency. As more countries conduct trade with the Eurozone,\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)215they will be motivated to accumulate more euros to reduce exchange risk and\ntransaction costs. Traditionally, most international trade transactions involve the\nBritish pound, the Japanese yen, and/or the U.S. dollar. Before the establishment of\nthe euro, it was unreasonable to hold large amounts of every individual EU national\ncurrency. As a result, currency reserves tended toward the dollar. At the end of the\n1990s, approximately 65% of all world reserves were held in U.S. dollars, but after\nthe introduction of the euro, foreign reserve assets slowly shifted towards the euro.\nThis trend will only continue as the world becomes more globalized.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nMakers—The European Central Bank\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is the governing body responsible for determining\nthe monetary policy of the countries participating in the EMU. The Executive Board\nof the EMU consists of the president of the ECB, the vice president of the ECB, and\nfour other members. These individuals, along with the governors of the national\ncentral banks, comprise the Governing Council. The ECB is set up such that the\nExecutive Board implements the policies dictated by the Governing Council. New\nmonetary policies decisions are typically made by majority vote, with the president\nhaving the casting vote in the event of a tie in their monthly meeting. After each\nmeeting the Central Bank president holds a press conference to answer questions.\nThis is also used as an opportunity to clarify their monetary policy stance.\nThe EMU’s primary objective is to maintain price stability and promote growth.\nMonetary and ﬁscal policy changes are made to ensure that this objective is met. With\nthe formation of the EMU, the Maastric ht Treaty was developed by the Union to\napply a number of criteria for each member country. These criteria were developed\nby the Union to help them achieve their objective. Deviations from these criteria\nby any one country will result in heavy ﬁnes. Listed below are the EMU criteria.\nIt is apparent based on these criteria that the ECB has a strict mandate focused on\ninﬂation and deﬁcit. Generally, the ECB strives to maintain annual growth in HCPI\n(Harmonized Consumer Price Index) below 2% and M3 (Money Supply) annual\ngrowth around 4.5%.\nThe EMU Criteria\nIn the 1992 Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) the following\npreconditions were created for any EU member state looking to join the economic\nand monetary union (EMU).\n■A rate of inﬂation no more than 1.5% above the average of the three best\nperforming member states, taking the average of the 12-month year-on-year rate\npreceding the assessment date.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)216■Long-term interest rates not exceeding the average rates of these low-inﬂation\nstates by more than 2% for the preceding 12 months.\n■Exchange rates which ﬂuctuate within the normal margins of the exchange-rate\nmechanism (ERM) for at least two years.\n■A general government debt/GDP ratio of not more than 60%, although a higher\nratio may be permissible if it is ‘‘sufﬁciently diminishing.’’\n■A general government deﬁcit not exceeding 3% of GDP, although a small and\ntemporary excess can be permitted.\nIf a country meets the convergence criteria and joins the EMU, their monetary\npolicy will be determined by the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB and the\nESCB (European System of Central Banks) are independent institutions from both\nnational governments and other EU institutions, granting them complete control\nover monetary policy. This operational independence is accorded to them as per\nArticle 108 of the Maastricht Treaty, which states that any member of the decision-\nmaking bodies cannot seek or take instructions from any Community Institutions,\nany government of a member state, or any other body. In other words, no one\ncountry can pressure the ECB into making a monetary policy change that is in only\ntheir best interest. The primary tools the ECB uses to control monetary policy is the\nfollowing.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe ECB has four main categories of open market operations to steer interest rates,\nmanage liquidity, and signal monetary policy stance. This includes:\n■Main reﬁnancing operations . These are regular liquidity-providing reverse transac-\ntions conducted weekly with a maturity o f two weeks, which provide the bulk of\nreﬁnancing to the ﬁnancial sector.\n■Longer-term reﬁnancing operations . These are liquidity-providing reverse transactions\nwith a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months, which provide\ncounterparties with additional longer-term reﬁnancing.\n■Fine-tuning operations . These are executed on an ad-hoc basis, with the aim of\nboth managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates, in\nparticular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected\nliquidity ﬂuctuations.\n■Structural operations . These involve the issuance of debt certiﬁcates, reverse trans-\nactions, and outright transactions. These operations will be executed whenever\nthe ECB wishes to adjust th e structural position of the Eurosystem vis-` a-vis the\nﬁnancial sector (on a regular or nonregular basis).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)217ECB Minimum Bid Rate (Repo Rate)\nThe ECB minimum bid rate is the key policy target for the ECB and the level of\nborrowing that the ECB offers to the central banks of its member states. This is also\nthe rate that is subject to change at the monthly ECB meetings. Since inﬂation is a\nmajor concern for European policy makers, they are generally more inclined to keep\ninterest rates at lofty levels to prevent inﬂation. Changes in the ECB’s minimum bid\nrate can have large ramiﬁcations for the EUR.\nThe ECB does not have an exchange rate target, but will factor in exchange rates\nin their policy deliberations because they can affect price stability. A high exchange\nrate lowers inﬂationary pressures while a low exchange rate promotes it. The ECB is\nnot prohibited from intervening in the foreign exchange markets if they believe that\ninﬂation is a concern. As a result, comments by members of the Governing Council\nare closely watched by forex traders and can have a signiﬁcant impact on the euro.\nIn addition to their monthly meetings, the Central Bank will also publish a\nmonthly bulletin and release staff forecasts and minutes from past meetings. The\npresident of the Central Bank holds a press conference after the policy meeting and\nthat, along with each of these event risk s, can cause volatility in the currency.\nNow let’s take a look at some of the important characteristics of the euro:\n■EURUSD cross is the most liquid and actively traded currency . The euro was introduced\nas an electronic currency in January 1999. At the time, the euro replaced all\npre-EMU currencies, except for Greece’s currency, which was converted to the\neuro in January 2001. As a result, the EURUSD cross is now the most liquid\ncurrency in the world and its movements are used as the primary gauge of the\nhealth of both the European and U.S. economies. Figure 27.1 highlights the\n10 year performance of EUR-USD. The euro is most frequently known as the\n‘‘anti-dollar’’ since dollar or U.S. fundamentals generally have a greater impact\non the movement of the currency.\nEURJPY and EURCHF are also very liquid currencies that can be used as a\ngauge of the health of the Japanese and Swiss economies. Many new traders will\nstart with the EURUSD because of its orderly movements, tight spread, and\nliquidity.\n■Euro: A currency without a country . One of the greatest problems of the euro is that it\nis currency without a country. Instead, it bears the economic, political, and social\nrisks of 19 different nations. This is its gr eatest strength and its greatest weakness.\nIn the past decade, we have seen how the debt crisis in smaller Eurozone nations\nhave affected the currency as a whole. It undermines conﬁdence and has, on many\noccasions, put the entire monetary union at risk.\n■Spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and 10-year Bunds can indicate euro sentiment .\nTen-year government bonds can serve as an important indicator of where the euro\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)218\nFIGURE 27.1 EURUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)219is headed, especially against the U.S. dollar. The differential between the 10-year\nU.S. government bond and the 10-year German Bund rates can provide a good\nindication for EURUSD’s movement. If Bund rates are higher than U.S. Treasury\nrates and the differential increases, or the spread widens, this is generally positive\nfor the EURUSD. Alternatively, a decrease in the differential or a tightening of\nthe interest rates is generally bearish for EURUSD. As there is no Euro bond,\nthe 10-year German Bund yield is typically used as the benchmark bond for the\nEurozone because Germany is the largest country in the monetary union.\n■Predictions for euro area money ﬂows . Another useful rate to follow is the three-month\ninterest rate, also known as the euro interbank offer rate or the Euribor rate. This\nis the rate offered from one large bank to another on interbank term deposits.\nTraders tend to compare the Euribor futures rate with the Eurodollar futures rate.\nEurodollars are deposits denominated in U.S. dollars at banks and other ﬁnancial\ninstitutions outside the United States. Because investors like high-yielding assets,\nEuropean ﬁxed-income assets become more attractive as the spread between\nEuribor futures and Eurodollar futures widens in favor of Euribors. As the spread\nnarrows, European assets become less attractive, whereby implying a potential\ndecrease in money ﬂows into the Euro.\nMergers and acquisition activity can also affect how the EURUSD moves.\nIn recent years we have seen increased M&A activity between EU and U.S.\nmultinationals. Large deals, especially with a large cash component, can lead to a\nsudden burst in the EURUSD, but the reaction is generally short-lived.\n■Important Indicators for the Euro\nWhen it comes to Eurozone economic reports, the only ones that affect the euro are\nGerman or Eurozone data. The largest countries in the Eurozone in order of GDP\ncontribution are Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. While French and Italian data\nare important, they rarely move the currency. So what forex traders should focus on\nare the broader regional reports and German data. Central bank rate decisions are\nthe most important, but here are some additional economic reports that can have\nmeaningful impact on the currency.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the Manufacturing\nand Service sectors. For the Eurozone, they provide this data for the four largest\neconomies and a composite index for the region. These numbers are extremely\nmarket moving because they provide the most up-to-date information on how each\nof the economies are performing in the current month and not how the economies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)220performed the previous month like many other reports. However, since the reports\nare for the current period, they are usually subject to revisions so the euro will\nmove on the preliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents\nexpansion, and a reading below 50 represents contraction. For the Eurozone, the\nmanufacturing PMI index is the most important along with the composite index,\nwhich aggregates how the manufacturing and service sector are performing. Since\nthe German data are released shortly before the Eurozone report, they can have a\ngreater impact on the currency.\nIFO Survey\nGermany is by far the largest economy in Europe and is responsible for approximately\n20% of total GDP. Any insight into German business conditions is seen as an insight\ninto Europe as a whole. The IFO is a monthly survey conducted by the IFO institute.\nThey survey over 7,000 German businesses, asking for their assessment of the\nGerman business climate and their short-term plans. The initial publication of the\nresults consists of the business climate headline ﬁgure and its two equally weighted\nsubindices: current business conditions and business expectations. The typical range\nis from 80 to 120, with a higher number indicating greater business conﬁdence. The\nreport is most valuable, however, when measured against previous data.\nInﬂation Indicators—HICP\nSince the ECB has an inﬂation mandate, the EU Harmonized Index of Consumer\nPrices (HICP) published by Eurostat is very important. This harmonized index is\ndesigned for international comparison as required by EU law. The index is compiled\nwith information on prices retrieved by each national statistical agency. Individual\ncountries are required to provide Eurostat with the 100 indices used to compute the\nHICP. The national HICPs are totaled by Eurostat as a weighted average of these\nsubindices, and the weights used are country-speciﬁc. The HICP is released at the\nend of the month following the reference period, which is about 10 days after the\npublications of the national CPIs from Spain and France, the ﬁnal EMU-5 countries\nto release their CPIs. Even if part of the information is already known when the\nHICP is released, it is an important release because it serves as the reference inﬂation\nindex for the ECB who aims to keep Eurozone consumer price inﬂation between\n0% and 2%.\nGerman Industrial Production\nIndustrial production data are seasonally adjusted (SA) and include a breakdown into\nfour major subcategories: mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction. The\nmanufacturing aggregate comprises four main product groups: basic and producer\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)221goods, capital goods, consumer durables, and consumer nondurables. The market\ntends to pay attention to the annual rate of change and the seasonally adjusted\nmonth-on-month ﬁgure. Germany’s ﬁgure is most important since it is the largest\ncountry in the Eurozone; however, the market can also react to the French industrial\nproduction report. The initial industrial production release is based on a narrower\ndata sample and hence subject to revision when the full sample has become available.\nThe ministry occasionally provides insight on the expected direction of the revision\nin the initial data release.\nGerman Unemployment\nLabor market numbers are important for every country and in the case of the\nEurozone, German unemployment is the most important. Released by the Labor\nOfﬁce, the data contain information on the number of unemployed, as well as\nthe changes on the previous month, on both seasonally (SA) and nonseasonally\n(NSA) adjusted terms. The NSA unemployment rate is provided, along with data\non vacancies, short-shift working arrangements, and the number of employees\n(temporarily suspended in 1999). Within an hour after the FLO release, the\nBundesbank releases the SA unemployment rate. The day ahead of the release,\nthere is often a leak of the ofﬁcial data from a trade-union source. The leak is\nusually of the NSA level of unemployment in millions. When a precise ﬁgure is\nreported on Reuters, as given by ‘‘sources’’ for the NSA level of unemployment,\nthe leak usually reﬂects t he ofﬁcial ﬁgures. Rumors often circulate up to one week\nbefore the ofﬁcial release, and they are notoriously imprecise. Regardless, a drop\nin unemployment along with an improvement in the jobless rate is positive for the\ncurrency, whereas a rise in jobless claims or increase in the unemployment rate is\nnegative for the currency.\nPreliminary GDP\nPreliminary GDP is issued when Eurostat has collected data from a sufﬁcient number\nof countries to produce an estimate. This usually includes France, Germany, and\nthe Netherlands. However, Italy is not included in the preliminary release and is\nonly added in the ﬁnal number. The yearly aggregates for EU-15 and EMU-11\nare a simple sum of national GDP. For the quarterly accounts, the aggregation is\nmore complex since some countries (Greece, Ireland, and Luxembourg) do not\nyet produce quarterly national accounts data. Moreover, Portugal produces only\npartial quarterly accounts with a signiﬁcant lag. Thus, both the EU-15 and EMU-11\nquarterly paths are the result of estimates from quarterly data based on a group of\ncountries accounting for more than 95% of total EU GDP (see the Foreword for a\ndetailed description of the weights of each country in the EU).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)222M3\nM3 is a broad measure of money supply, which includes everything from notes\nand coins to bank deposits. The ECB closely monitors M3 as they view it as a key\nmeasure of inﬂation. At its session in December 1998, the governing council of the\nECB set its ﬁrst reference value for M3 growth at 4.5%. This value supports inﬂation\nb e l o w2 % ,t r e n dg r o w t ho f2 %t o2 . 5 % ,a n dal o n g - t e r md e c l i n ei nt h ev e l o c i t y\nof money by 0.5% to 1%. The growth rate is monitored on a three-month moving\naverage basis in order to prevent monthly volatility to distort the information given\nby the aggregate. The ECB’s approach to monetary targeting leaves considerable\nroom for maneuver and interpretation. Because the ECB does not impose bands\non M3 growth, as the Bundesbank used to do, there will be no automatic action\nwhen M3 growth diverges from the reference value. Moreover, although the ECB\nconsiders M3 to be the key indicator, it will also take into account the changes in\nother monetary aggregates.\nIndividual Country Budget Deﬁcits\nThe Stability and Growth Pact states that budget deﬁcits for every country in the\nmonetary union must be kept below 3% of GDP. Failure to meet these targets will\nbe punished. However through the years many Eurozone nations have had deﬁcits\nin excess of 3% and penalties have not been enforced.\n223CHAPTER 28\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nBritish Pound (GBP)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe United Kingdom is the world’s ﬁfth largest economy with GDP valued at\napproximately US$3 trillion in 2014 according to the IMF. With one of the most\ndynamic central banks in the world, the UK economy beneﬁted from many years of\nstrong growth, low unemployment, expa nding output, and resilient consumption.\nThe strength of consumer consumption has been largely due to the strong housing\nmarket. The United Kingdom is a service-oriented economy, with manufacturing\nrepresenting an increasingly smaller portion of GDP, now equivalent to only one-\nﬁfth of national output. Their capital market system is one of the most developed\nin the world, with ﬁnance and banking being the strongest contributors to GDP.\nAlthough the majority of the UK’s GDP is from services, it is also one of the\nlargest producers and exporters of natural gas in the European Union. The energy\nproduction industry accounts for 10% of GDP, which is one of the highest shares of\nany industrialized nation. This is particularly important, as increases in energy prices\n(such as oil) will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt the large number of UK oil exporters. (The\nUnited Kingdom became a net oil importer for a brief period due to disruptions in\nthe North Sea in 2003, but it has already resumed its status as a net oil exporter.)\nOverall, the United Kingdom is a net importer of goods with a consistent\ntrade deﬁcit. Its largest trading partner is the EU, with trade between the two\nconstituencies accounting for over 50% of all of the country’s import and export\nactivities. The United States, on an individual basis, still remains the United\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)224Kingdom’s largest trading partner. The breakdowns of the most important trading\npartners for the United Kingdom are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. Germany\n3. Switzerland\n4. Netherlands\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Netherlands\n3. China\n4. United States\n5. France\nSince the launch of the euro in 1999, the single currency’s troubles have become\nincreasingly apparent, and this has made the UK’s decision to maintain its own\ncurrency and monetary authority increasingly intelligent. Yet the possibility of euro\nadoption will remain a question in the minds of pound traders for many years\nto come, although in 2015 into 2016, the more relevant question is whether the\nUnited Kingdom will remain in the EMU. A decision on euro entry has signiﬁcant\nramiﬁcations for the UK economy—the most important of which is that UK interest\nrates would have to be adjusted to reﬂect the equivalent interest rate of the Eurozone.\nOne of the primary arguments against adopting the euro is that the UK government\nhas sound macroeconomic policies that have worked very well for the country for\ndecades. Its successful monetary and ﬁscal policies have led it to outperform most\nmajor economies during economic downturns, including the European Union.\nThe UK Treasury has previously speciﬁed ﬁve economic tests that must be met\nprior to euro entry, which are the following:\nUK’s Five Economic Tests for Euro\n1. Is there sustainable convergence in business cycles and economic structures\nbetween the United Kingdom and other EMU members, so that the UK citizens\ncould live comfortably with euro interest rates on a permanent basis?\n2. Is there enough ﬂexibility to cope with economic change?\n3. Would joining the EMU create an environment that would encourage ﬁrms to\ninvest in the United Kingdom?\n4. Would joining the EMU have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the\nUK’s ﬁnancial services industry?\n5. Would joining the EMU be good for promoting stability and growth in\nemployment?\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)225The United Kingdom is a very political country where government ofﬁcials are\nhighly concerned with voter approval. If voters do not support euro entry, the\nlikelihood of EMU entry would decline. The following are some of the arguments\nfor and against adopting the euro:\nArguments in Favor of Adopting the Euro\n■There would be reduced exchange rate uncertainty for UK businesses and lower\nexchange rate transa ction costs or risks.\n■The prospect of sustained low inﬂation under the governance of the European\nCentral Bank should reduce long-term interest rates and stimulate sustained\neconomic growth.\n■Single currency promotes price transparency.\n■The integration of national ﬁnancial markets of the EU will lead to higher efﬁciency\nin the allocation of capital in Europe.\n■The euro is the second most important reserve currency after the USD.\n■With the United Kingdom joining the euro, the political clout of the EMU would\nincrease dramatically.\nArguments against Adopting the Euro\n■Currency unions have collapsed in the past.\n■Economic or political instabilities of one country would impact the Euro, which\nwould have exchange rate ramiﬁcations for otherwise healthy countries.\n■Strict EMU criteria outlined by the Stability and Growth Pact.\n■Entry would mean a permanent transfer of domestic monetary authority to the\nEuropean Central Bank.\n■Joining a currency union with no monetary ﬂexibility would require the United\nKingdom to have more ﬂexibility in the labor and housing markets.\n■There are fears about which countries might dominate the ECB.\n■Adjusting to new currency will require large transaction costs.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Bank\nof England\nFor the United Kingdom, the Bank of England (BoE) controls monetary policy, and\nthe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is a nine-member committee responsible\nfor setting interest rate policy in the United Kingdom. It consists of a governor,\ntwo deputy governors, two executive directors of the central bank, and four outside\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)226experts. The committee was granted operational independence in 1997, which\nmeans they won’t be inﬂuenced by the governing party. Despite this independence,\nmonetary policies have centered on achieving an inﬂation target dictated by the\nChancellor of the Treasury. Currently, this target is RPIX (Retail Price Index)\ninﬂation of 2.5%. The central bank has the power to change interest rates to levels\nthat will allow them to meet this target. The MPC holds monthly meetings, which\nare closely followed for announcements on changes in monetary policy, including\nchanges in the interest rate (bank repo rate). When no changes are made, no details\nare provided. In this case, the rate decision is generally a nonevent for the currency,\nwith traders shifting their focus to the minutes released two weeks later.\nThe MPC publishes statements after every meeting, along with a quarterly\nInﬂation Report that details the MPC’s two-year forecast for growth and inﬂation\nalong with justiﬁcation for policy movements. In addition, another publication,\ntheQuarterly Bulletin, provides information on past monetary policy movements\nand analysis of the international economic environment and its impacts on the UK\neconomy. All of these reports can provide guidance of future policy changes. The\nmain policy tools used by the MPC and BoE are the following.\nBank Repo Rate\nThis is the key rate used in monetary policy to meet the Treasury’s inﬂation target.\nThis rate is set for the Bank’s own operati ons in the market, such as its short-term\nlending activities. Changes to this rate affect the rates set by the commercial banks\nfor their savers and borrowers. In turn, this rate will affect spending and output in\nthe economy, and eventually costs and prices. An increase in this rate would imply\nan attempt to curb inﬂation and slow growth, while a decrease in this rate would be\naimed at stimulating growth and expansion.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe goal of open market operations is to implement changes in the bank repo rate,\nwhile assuring adequate liquidity in the market and continued stability in the banking\nsystem. This is reﬂective of the three main objectives of the BoE: maintaining the\nintegrity and value of the currency, maintaining the stability of the ﬁnancial system,\nand seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the United Kingdom’s ﬁnancial services.\nTo ensure liquidity, the Bank conducts daily open market operations to buy or sell\nshort-term government ﬁxed-income instruments. If this is not sufﬁcient to meet\nliquidity needs, the Bank would also conduct additional overnight operations.\nImportant Characteristics of the British Pound\n■GBPUSD is very liquid . The GBPUSD is one of the most liquid currencies in the\nworld, with 6% of all currency trading involving the British pound as either\nthe base or counter currency. It is also one of the three most liquid currencies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)227alongside EURUSD and USDJPY. One of the reasons for the currency’s liquidity\nis the country’s highly developed capital markets. Many foreign investors seeking\nopportunities other than the United States have sent their funds to the United\nKingdom for investment. In order to create these transactions, foreigners will\nneed to sell their local currency and buy British pounds.\n■GBP has three names . The UK’s currency has three names: the British pound,\nsterling, and cable. All of these are used interchangeably.\n■GBP is laden with speculators . At the time of publication, the British pound has one\nof the highest interest rates among the developed nations. Although Australia\nand New Zealand have higher interest rates, their ﬁnancial markets are not as\ndeveloped as that of the United Kingdom. As a result, many investors who already\nhave positions or are interested in initiating new carry trades positions frequently\nuse the GBP as the lending currency and will go long the pound against currencies\nsuch as the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. A carry trade involves\nbuying or lending a currency with a higher interest and selling or borrowing a\ncurrency with a lower interest rate. In recent years, carry trades have increased in\npopularity, which helped spur demand for the British pound. However, should the\ninterest rate yield differential bet ween the pound and other currencies narrow,\nan exodus of carry traders will increase volatility in the British pound.\n■Interest rate differentials between Gilt s and foreign bonds ar e closely followed . Interest rate\ndifferentials between UK Gilts—U.S. Tr easuries and UK Gilts and German Bunds\nare widely watched by FX market participants. Gilts versus Treasuries can be a\nbarometer of GBPUSD ﬂows, while Gilts versus Bunds can be used as a barometer\nfor EURGBP ﬂows. More speciﬁcally, these interest rate differentials indicate how\nmuch premium yield UK ﬁxed-income assets are offering over U.S. and European\n(German Bunds are usually used as a barometer for European yield) ﬁxed-income\nassets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders with indications of potential\ncapital ﬂow or currency movements, as global investors are always shifting their\ncapital in search of the assets with the highest yields. The United Kingdom can\nprovide these yields with the safety of having the same credit stability as the United\nStates.\n■Euro sterling futures can give indications for interest rate movements .S i n c et h eU K\ninterest rate or bank repo rate is the primary tool used in monetary policy, it is\nimportant to keep abreast of potential changes to the interest rate. Comments\nfrom government ofﬁcials is one way to gauge biases for potential rate changes,\nbut the Bank of England is one of the only central banks that requires members\nof the Monetary Policy Committee to publish their speciﬁc voting records.\nThis personal accountability indicates that comments by individual committee\nmembers represent their own opinions and not that of the BoE. Therefore,\nit is necessary to look for other indication of potential BoE rate movements.\nThree-month euro sterling futures reﬂect market expectations on euro sterling\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)228\nFIGURE 28.1 GBPUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\ninterest rates three months into the future. These contracts are also useful in\npredicting UK interest rate changes, which will ultimately affect the ﬂuctuations\nof the GBPUSD. Figure 28.1 illustrates 10 year performance of GBP-USD.\n■Comments on euro by UK politicians will impact the euro . Any speeches, remarks\n(especially from the Prime Minister or Treasury Chancellor), or polls in regards\nto the euro will impact currency trade. Indication of adoption of the euro tends\nto put downward pressure on GBP, while further opposition to euro entry will\ntypically boost the GBP. Reason being that in order for the GBP to come in line\nwith the euro, interest rates would have to decline and monetary policy would\nhave to be subjected to a foreign entity. A decrease in the interest rate would\ninduce carry trade investors to close their positions or sell pounds. The GBPUSD\nwould also decline because of the uncertainties involved with Euro adoption. The\nUK economy is performing very well under the direction of its current monetary\nauthority. The EMU is currently encountering many difﬁculties with member\ncountries breaching EMU criteria. With one monetary authority dictating 19\ncountries (plus UK would be 20), the EMU has yet to prove that they have\ndeveloped a monetary policy suitable for all member states.\n■GBP has positive correlation with energy prices . The UK houses some of the largest\nenergy companies in the world, including British Petroleum. Energy production\nrepresents 10% of GDP. As a result, the British pound tends to have a positive\ncorrelation with energy prices. Speciﬁcally, since many members of the EU\nimport oil from the United Kingdom, as oil prices increase, they will, in turn,\nhave to buy more pounds to fund their energy purchases. In addition, rises in the\nprice of oil will also beneﬁt the earnings of the nations’ energy exporters.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)229■GBP crosses . Although the GBP/USD is a more liquid currency than EURGBP,\nEURGBP is typically the leading gauge for GBP strength. The GBPUSD currency\npair tends to be more sensitive to U.S. developments, while EURGBP is a\nmore pure fundamental pound trade since Europe is Britain’s primary trade\nand investment partner. However, both currencies are naturally interdependent,\nwhich means movements in the EURGBP can affect movements in the GBPUSD.\nThe reverse is also true—that is, movements in GBPUSD will also affect trading\nin EURGBP. Therefore, it is important for pound traders to be consciously aware\nof the trading behavior of both currency pairs. The EURGBP rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURUSD divided by the GBPUSD rate. Small differences in\nthese rates are often exploited by market participants and quickly eliminated.\n■Important Economic Indicators\nfor the United Kingdom\nAll of the following indicators are important for the United Kingdom. However,\nsince the United Kingdom is primarily a service-oriented economy, it is particularly\nimportant to pay attention to service sector data.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the manufacturing,\nservice, and construction sectors. These numbers are extremely market moving\nbecause they provide the most up-to-date information on how each of the economies\nis performing in the current month and not how the economies performed\nthe previous month, like many other reports. However since the reports are for the\ncurrent period, they are usually subject to revisions, so the euro will move on the\npreliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents expansion, and a\nreading below 50 represents contraction. For the United Kingdom, the PMI services\nindex is the most important, along with the composite index, which aggregates how\nthe manufacturing and service sector are performing.\nEmployment Situation\nThe employment report is a monthly survey of the labor market conducted by\nthe Ofﬁce of National Statistics. The obj ectives of the survey are to divide the\nworking-age population into three separate classiﬁcations (employed, unemployed,\nand not in the labor force), and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of\nthese categories. Data from the survey provide market participants with information\non major labor market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors,\nhours worked, labor force participation, and unemployment rates. The timeliness\nof the survey makes it a closely watched s tatistic by the currency market as it is a\ngood barometer of the strength of the UK economy and an important input into\nmonetary policy.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)230Retail Sales\nThe key to growth is consumer spending, and for this reason, the retail sales report\nis also extremely market moving. The Retail Sales Index measures the total goods\nsold by a sampling of retail stores over the course of a month. This index is used as\na gauge of consumer consumption and consumer conﬁdence. While retail sales can\nbe quite volatile due to seasonality, it is one of the most important indicators on the\nhealth of the economy, along with a key input for GDP.\nConsumer or Retail Price Index\nCPI or RPI is a measure of the change in prices of a basket of consumer goods. The\nmarkets however focus on the underlying RPI or RPI-X, which excludes mortgage\ninterest payments. The RPI-X is closely watc hed as the treasury sets inﬂation targets\nfor the BoE, currently deﬁned as 2.5% annual growth in RPI-X.\nGDP\nGDP is a quarterly report conducted by the Bureau of Statistics. GDP is a measure\nof the total production and consumption of goods and services in the UK. GDP\nis measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses, government, and\nnet foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert output measured\nat current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used to gauge where in\nthe business cycle the United Kingdom ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is perceived\nas inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or weak\ngrowth.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures the change in output in the United\nKingdom of manufacturing; mining and quarrying; and electricity, gas, and water\nsupply. Output refers to the physical quantity of items produced, unlike sales value,\nwhich combines quantity and price. The index covers the production of goods and\npower for domestic sales in the United Kingdom and for export. Because IP is\nresponsible for close to a quarter of gross domestic product, IP is widely watched as\nit can provide good insight into the current state of the economy.\nUK Housing Starts\nHousing starts measures the number of residential building construction projects\nthat have begun during any particular month. This is important for the United\nKingdom as the housing market is the primary industry that sustains the economy.\n231CHAPTER 29\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nSwiss Franc (CHF)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nSwitzerland is the twentieth largest economy in the world, with a GDP valued at\nover US$685 billion as of 2014. Although the economy is relatively small, it is one of\nthe wealthiest in the world on a GDP per capita basis. The country is prosperous and\ntechnologically advanced with economic and political stability that rivals many larger\neconomies. The country’s prosperity stems primarily from technological expertise\nin manufacturing, tourism, and banking. More speciﬁcally, Switzerland is known for\ntheir chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, machinery, precision instruments,\nwatches, and a ﬁnancial system historically known for protecting the conﬁdentiality\nof its investors. This coupled with the country’s lengthy history of political neutrality\nearned Switzerland the Swiss franc safe haven status and as a direct result of that,\nit is the one world’s most popular destinations for offshore capital. Even when the\ncentral bank introduced a temporary 1.20 EURCHF peg and lowered interest rates\nto negative levels, Switzerland stil l managed to attract safe haven ﬂows.\nIt is estimated that Switzerland holds over US$2 trillion in offshore assets as of\n2014 and attracts over 35% of the world’s private wealth management business.\nA large and highly advanced banking and insurance industry has developed to support\nthis demand, and the sector employs over 50% of the population and comprises over\n70% of total GDP. Since Switzerland’s ﬁnancial industry thrives on its safe haven\nstatus and renowned conﬁdentiality, capital ﬂows tend to drive the economy during\ntimes of global risk aversion, while trade ﬂows drive the economy in a risk-seeking\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)232environment. Trade ﬂows are extremely important, with nearly two thirds of all\ntrade conducted with Europe. With this in mind, Switzerland’s most important\ntrading partners a re the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Germany\n2. India\n3. United States\n4. Hong Kong\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Italy\n3. United States\n4. France\n5. China\nTraditionally, Switzerland has a strong trade and current account surplus that\nlends support to the currency. Most of the surplus can be attributed to the large\namount of foreign direct investment into the country, in seek of safety of capital,\ndespite the low to negative yields offered by Switzerland.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Swiss\nNational Bank\nMonetary policy in Switzerland is determined by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). They\nare a completely independent authority with a three-person committee responsible\nfor determining monetary policy. This committee consists of a chairman, a vice\nchairman, and one other (member) who constitute the Governing Board of the\nSNB. Due to the small size of the committee, all decisions are based on a consensus\nvote. The Board reviews monetary policy at least once a quarter, but decisions on\nmonetary policy can be made and announced at any point in time. Unlike most other\ncentral banks, the SNB does not set one ofﬁcial interest rate target, but instead sets\na target range for their three-month Swiss Libor rate.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nIn December of 1999, the SNB shifted from focusing on monetary targets (M3) to an\ninﬂation target of less than 2% inﬂation per year. This measure is taken based on the\nnational consumer price index. Monetary targets still remain important indicators\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)233and are closely watched by the central bank, because they provide information on\nthe long-term inﬂation. This new inﬂation focus also increases the central bank’s\ntransparency. In their mandate, they have clearly stated, ‘‘Should inﬂation exceed\n2% in the medium term, the National Bank will tend to tighten its monetary stance.’’\nIf there is danger of deﬂation, the National Bank would loosen monetary policy. The\nSNB also closely monitors exchange rates, as excessive strength in the Swiss franc\ncan cause inﬂationary conditions. This is especially true in environments of global\nrisk aversion, as capital ﬂows into Switzerland increases signiﬁcantly during those\ntimes. As a result, the SNB typically favors a weak franc, and is not hesitant to use\nintervention as liquidity tool. SNB ofﬁcials intervene in the franc using a variety of\nmethods including verbal remarks on liquidity, money supply, and the currency.\nTheir Tools\nThe most commonly used tools by the SNB to implement monetary policy include\nthe following.\nTarget Interest Rate Range\nTraditionally, the SNB implements monetary policy by setting a target range for\ntheir three-month interest rate known as the Swiss Franc Libor rate. According\nto the SNB, ‘‘The Libor is a reference inte rest rate in the interbank market for\nunsecured loans.’’ It is a trimmed mean of the rates charged by 12 leading banks and\nis published daily by the British Bankers’ Association. The National Bank publishes\nits target range regularly. As a rule, this range extends over 1 percentage point,\nand the SNB generally aims to keep the Libor in the middle of the range. The SNB\nundertakes quarterly economic and monetary assessments at which it reviews its\nmonetary policy. If circumstances so require, it will also adjust the Libor target\nrange in between these quarterly assessments. It sets out the reasons for its decisions\nin press releases.\nOpen Market Operations\nRepo transactions are the SNB’s major monetary policy instrument. A repo\ntransaction involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider\n(lender), while agreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity\nat a later date. This structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker\nmust pay the cash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short\nmaturities ranging from one day to a few weeks. The SNB uses these repo transactions\nto manipulate undesirable moves in the three-month Libor rate. To prevent increases\nin the three-month Libor rate above the SNB’s target, the bank would supply the\ncommercial banks with additional liquidity through repo transactions at lower repo\nrates, and in essence create additional liquidity. Conversely, the SNB can reduce\nliquidity or induce increases in the three-month Libor rate by increasing repo rates.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)234In addition to the quarterly monetary policy decision, the SNB publishes a\nQuarterly Bulletin with a detailed assessment of the current state of the economy\nand a review of monetary policy. A Monthly Bulletin is also published containing a\nshort review of economic developments. These reports are important to watch, as\nthey may contain information on changes in the SNB’s assessment of economy and\nguidance on monetary policy.\n1.20 EUR/CHF Peg Implementation and Abandonment\nFew would have expected that one of the seminal developments in the forex market\nwas the Swiss National Bank’s decision to implement and later abandon its 1.20\nEURCHF peg. This decision transformed the foreign exchange industry, bankrupted\nmany brokers, and led to tighter regulations across the globe. Faced with a high level\nof uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued currency and deﬂation risks\nin 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At\nthe time, it pledged to sell francs in an unlimited quantity to maintain the peg. The\ngoal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping the gain in the franc. However,\nin January 2015, the prospect of quantitative easing from the European Central\nBank pushed the SNB to abandon the peg. It also accumulated signiﬁcant foreign\nexchange reserves that irritated critics, but more importantly, the franc became less\novervalued through the years, giving the SNB fewer reasons to maintain the peg.\nSNB’s decision was a complete surprise, and caused a 30% drop in EURCHF in\na single day. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\n■Important Characteristics of the Swiss Franc\n■Safe haven status . This is perhaps the most unique characteristic of the Swiss franc.\nSwitzerland’s safe haven status is continually stressed because this and the secrecy\nof the banking system are the key advantages of Switzerland. The Swiss franc\nmoves primarily on external events rather than domestic economic conditions.\nThat is, as mentioned earlier, due to its political neutrality, the franc is considered\nthe world’s premier safe haven currency. Therefore, in times of global instability\nand/or uncertainty, investors tend to be more concerned with capital retention\nthan appreciation. At such times, funds will ﬂow into Switzerland, which would\ncause the Swiss franc to appreciate regardless of whether growth conditions are\nfavorable.\n■Swiss franc is closely correlated with gold . Switzerland is the world’s third largest\nofﬁcial holder of gold. In the past, a Swiss constitutional mandate required the\ncurrency to be backed 40% with gold reserves. The mandate is now removed\nbut the positive correlation between the Swiss franc and gold remains because\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)235the relationship has been engrained into the minds of forex traders; therefore,\nboth gold and the Swiss franc are perceived as safe haven instruments. Before the\nSNB abandoned the EURCHF 1.20, Swiss franc had an 80% positive correlation\nwith gold. These days, the correlation is still there but in a smaller magnitude.\nGenerally speaking, if the price of gold appreciates, the Swiss franc has a high\nlikelihood of rising in value. In addition, since gold is also viewed as the ultimate\nsafe haven form of money, both gold and the Swiss franc beneﬁt during periods\nof global economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n■Carry trades effects . With one of the lowest interest rates in the industrialized world,\nover the past few years, the Swiss franc has become one of the most popular\nfunding currencies for carry trades. As mentioned in this book, the popularity of\ncarry trades has increased signiﬁcantly over the past two decades, as investors are\nactively seeking high yield. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency\nwith a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest\nrate. With CHF having one of the lowest interest rates of all industrialized\ncountries, it is one of the primary currencies sold or borrowed in carry trades.\nThis results in the need to sell CHF against a higher yielding currency. Carry\ntrades are typically done in cross-currencies such as GBPCHF or AUDCHF, but\nthese trades can impact both EURCHF and USDCHF. The unwinding of carry\ntrades involves the need for investors to buy back the Swiss franc.\n■Interest rate differentials between euro Swiss futures and foreign interest rate futures are\nclosely followed . One of the favorite indicators of professional Swiss franc traders\nis the interest rate differential bet ween three-month euro Swiss futures and\neurodollar futures. These differentials can provide guidance on potential money\nﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield U.S. ﬁxed-income assets are\noffering over Swiss ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides\ntraders with indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always\nlooking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry\ntraders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate\ndifferentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Potential changes in banking regulations . Over the past few years members of the\nEuropean Union have been exerting signiﬁcant pressure on Switzerland to relax\nthe conﬁdentiality of their banking system and to increase transparency of their\ncustomers’ accounts. The European Union is pressing this issue because of its\nactive measures to persecute EU tax evaders. This should be a concern for many\nyears to come. However, this is a difﬁcult decision for Switzerland to make because\nthe conﬁdentiality of their customers’ accounts represents the core strength of\ntheir banking system. The EU has threatened to impose severe sanctions on\nSwitzerland if they do not comply with their proposed measures. Both countries\nare currently working to negotiate an equitable resolution. Any news or talk of\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)236changing banking regulations will impact both Switzerland’s economy and the\nSwiss franc.\n■Mergers and acquisition activity . Switzerland’s primary industry is banking and\nﬁnance. In this industry, merger and acquisition activities (M&A) are very\ncommon, especially as consolidation continues in the overall industry. As a result,\nthese M&A activities can have signiﬁcant impact on the Swiss franc. If foreign\nﬁrms purchase Swiss banks or insurance companies, they will need to buy Swiss\nfrancs and in turn, sell their local currency. If Swiss banks purchase foreign ﬁrms,\nthey would need to sell Swiss francs and buy the foreign currency. Either way,\nit is important for Swiss franc traders to frequently watch for notices on M&A\nactivity involving Swiss ﬁrms.\n■Trading behavior, cross currency characteristics . The EURCHF is the most commonly\ntraded currency for traders who want to participate in CHF movements. USDCHF\nis less frequently traded because of its greater illiquidity and volatility. However,\nday traders may tend to favor USDCHF over EURCHF because of its volatile\nmovements. In actuality, the USDCHF is a synthetic currency derived from\nEURUSD and EURCHF because more tra nsactions are done between the euro\nand Swiss franc. Market makers or professional traders tend to use those pairs as\nleading indicators for trading USDCHF or to price the current USDCHF level\nwhen the currency pair is illiquid. Theoretically, the USDCHF rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURCHF rate divided by EURUSD. Only during times of\nunusual circumstances, such as the Iraq War, September 11, or the EURCHF peg,\nwill USDCHF develop a market of its own. Any small differences in these rates\nare quickly exploited by market participants. Figure 29.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of EUR-CHF.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Switzerland\nEconomic data from Switzerland tends to have limited impact on the currency, but\nthese are the most important pieces of Swiss data.\nKoF Leading Indicators\nThe KoF leading indicators report is released by the Swiss Institute for Business\nCycle Research. This index is generally used to gauge the future health of the\nSwiss economy. It contains six components: (1) change in manufacturers’ orders;\n(2) the expected purchase plans of manufacturers over the next three months; (3)\nthe judgment of stocks in wholesale business; (4) consumer perception of their\nﬁnancial conditions; (5) backlog in the construction sector; and (6) orders backlog\nfor manufacturers.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)\nk\nk237\nk\nk\nFIGURE 29.1 EURCHF 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)238Consumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index is calculated monthly, on the basis of retail prices paid in\nSwitzerland. In accordance with prevalent international practice, the commodities\ncovered are distinguished according to the consumption concept, which includes in\nthe calculation of the CPI of those goods and services that are part of the private\nconsumption aggregate according to the National Accounts. The basket of goods does\nnot include transfer expenditure such as direct taxation, social insurance contributions,\nand health insurance premiums. The index is a key measure of inﬂation.\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services in\nthe Switzerland. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Switzerland ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nBalance of Payments\nBalance of payments is the collective term for the accounts of Swiss transactions\nwith the rest of the world. The current account is the balance of trade plus services\nportion. BoP is an important indicator for Swiss traders, as Switzerland has always\nkept a strong current account balance. Any changes to the current account, positive\nor negative, could see substantial ﬂows.\nProduction Index (Industrial Production)\nThe production index is a quarterly measure of the change in the volume of industrial\nproduction (or physical output by producers).\nRetail Sales\nSwitzerland’s retail sales report is released on a monthly basis 40 days after the\nreference month. The report is an important indicator of consumer spending habits\nand is not seasonally adjusted.\n239CHAPTER 30\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nJapanese Yen (JPY)\n■Economic Overview\nJapan is the third largest economy in the world with GDP valued at over US$4.6\ntrillion in 2014 (behind the United States and China). If we count the European\nUnion as a whole, it would be considered the fourth largest economy. Japan is one of\nthe world’s largest exporters and is responsible for over US$690 billion in exports\nper year. Manufacturing and exports of products such as electronics and cars are the\nsignature drivers of the economy, accounting for nearly 17% of GDP. As a result,\nJapanese growth is extremely sensitive to the value of the currency. For many years,\nJapan has maintained a trade surplus, but the earthquake followed by tsunami in\n2011 turned the country into a net oil importer and created a long period of trade\nimbalances, where oil imports exceeded exports in value. This began to change in\nearly 2015, when a weakening yen and falling oil prices helped to turn around trade\nactivity, returning Japan to a surplus nation. Having a trade surplus means that there\nwill be inherent demand for the Japanese yen even when interest rates are low\nand there are structural deﬁciencies. Japan’s most important trade partners are the\nUnited States and China:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. South Korea\n4. Taiwan\n5. Hong Kong\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)240Leading Import Sources:\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. South Korea\n4. Australia\n5. Saudi Arabia\n■Abenomics\nIn the 1980s, Japan’s capital market was one of the most attractive markets for\ninternational investors seeking investment opportunities in Asia. Japan had the most\ndeveloped capital markets in the region, and its banking system was considered to\nbe the one of the strongest in the world. At the time, the country was experiencing\nabove-trend economic growth and near zero inﬂation. This resulted in rapid\ngrowth expectations, boosted asset prices, and rapid credit expansion, leading to the\ndevelopment of an a sset bubble. Between 1990 and 1997, the asset bubble collapsed,\ninducing a US$10 trillion decline in asset prices, with the fall in real estate values\naccounting for nearly 65% of the total decline, nearly two years of national output.\nThis fall in asset prices sparked the banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early\n1990s and developed into a full-blown systemic crisis in 1997 following the failure\nof a number of high-proﬁle ﬁnancial institutions. Many of these banks and ﬁnancial\ninstitutions extended loans to builders and real estate developers at the height of\nthe asset bubble in the 1980s, with land as collateral. A number of these developers\ndefaulted after the asset bubble collapse, leaving the country’s banks saddled with\nbad debt and collateral worth sometimes 60% to 80% less than when the loans\nwere taken out. Due to the large size of these banking institutions and their role in\ncorporate funding, the crisis had profound effects on Japan and the global economy.\nEnormous bad debts, falling stock prices, and a collapsing real estate sector crippled\nJapan’s economy for more than two decades.\nIt was not until the rollout of Abenomics that the economy began to turn around.\nWhen Shinzo Abe became prime minister for the second time in 2012, he rolled out\na three-pronged plan to stimulate growth and pull the economy out of stagnation\nthrough monetary policy, ﬁscal policy, and economic growth strategies. This was\nknown as Abenomics . In the ﬁrst few weeks of the pr ogram, Abe announced a massive\nstimulus package that involved signiﬁcant government spending and a strong dose\nof quantitative easing. The effects were almost immediate, with the Japanese yen\nfalling signiﬁcantly across the board. Not soon after, the unemployment rate started\nto fall and growth slowly returned.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)241■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers\nMonetary policy in Japan is determined by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). In 1998, the\nJapanese government passed laws giving the BoJ operational independence from the\nMinistry of Finance (MoF) and complete control over monetary policy. However,\ndespite the government’s attempts to decen tralize decision making, the MoF still\nremains in charge of foreign exchange policy. The BoJ is responsible for executing\nall ofﬁcial Japanese foreign exchange transactions at the direction of the MoF. The\nBank of Japan’s Policy Board consists of the BoJ governor, two deputy governors,\nand six other members. Monetary policy meetings are held twice a month, with\nbrieﬁngs and press releases provided immediately. The BoJ also publishes a Monthly\nReport issued by the Policy Board, and a Monthly Economic Report . These reports\nare important to watch for changes in BoJ sentiment and signals of new monetary\nor ﬁscal policy measures, as the government is constantly trying to develop fresh\ninitiatives to stimulate growth.\nThe MoF and the BoJ are very important institutions, and they both can\ninﬂuence currency movements. Since the MoF is the director of foreign exchange\ninterventions, it is important to watch and keep abreast of the comments made\nfrom MoF ofﬁcials. Being an export driven economy, the government tends to favor\na weaker currency. So if the Japanese yen appreciates signiﬁcantly or too rapidly\nagainst the dollar, members of the BoJ and MoF will become increasingly vocal about\ntheir concerns or disapproval in regards to its current level or recent movements.\nThese comments can affect how the yen moves, but if government ofﬁcials ﬂood the\nmarket with comments and there is no follow-up action, the market would start\nto become immune to these concerns. However, the MoF and BoJ have a lengthy\nhistory of interventions in the currency markets to manipulate the value of the yen\nvalue in Japan’s best interests, so their comments cannot be completely ignored.\nThe most popular tool that the BoJ uses to control monetary policy is open\nmarket operations.\nOpen Market Operations\nThese activities are focused on controlling th e uncollateralized overnight call rate.\nThe Bank of Japan has maintained a zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) for some time\nnow, which means that the Bank of Japan cannot lower this rate further to stimulate\ngrowth, consumption, or liquidity. Therefore, in order to maintain zero interest\nrates, the BoJ has to manipulate liquidity through open market operations, targeting\nzero interest on the overnight call rate. It manipulates liquidity by the outright\nbuying or selling of bills, repos, or Japanese government bonds. A repo transaction\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)242involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider (lender), while\nagreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date.\nThis structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the\ncash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities,\nranging from one day to a few weeks.\nImportant Characteristics of the JPY\n■Proxy for Asian strength/weakness . Japan tends to be seen as a proxy for broad Asian\nstrength because the country has the largest GDP in Asia outside of China. With\nthe most developed capital markets, Japan was once the primary destination for\nall investors who wanted access into the region. Japan also conducts a signiﬁcant\namount of trade with its Asian partners. As a result, economic problems or\npolitical instability in Japan tend to spill over into the other Asian countries.\nHowever, this spillover is not one-sided. Economic or political problems in\nother Asian economies, particularly China, can also have dramatic impacts on\nthe Japanese economy and in turn movements in the Japanese yen. For example,\nNorth Korean political instability poses a great risk to Japan and the Japanese yen\ndue to the country’s geographic proximity.\n■Bank of Japan intervention practices . The BoJ and MoF are active participants in\nthe foreign exchange markets. That is, t hey have a lengthy history of entering\nthe FX markets if they are d issatisﬁed with the value of the Japanese yen. While\nthey have not intervened since 2011, they won’t be reluctant to do so if the\ncurrency strengthens signiﬁcantly. As Japan is a very political economy, with\nclose ties between government ofﬁcials and principals of large private institutions,\nthe MoF can have a very narrow segment in mind when it decides to intervene\nin the currency. Since the BoJ is such an active participant, it is very in tune\nwith the market movements and its participants. Periodically, the BoJ receives\ninformation on large hedge fund positions from banks and likes to intervene when\nspeculators are on the other side of the market, allowing them to get the most\n‘‘bang for the bucks.’’ The MoF and BoJ always considers three main factors\nbefore intervention:\n1.Amount of appreciation/depreciation in JPY —Intervention has historically\noccurred when the yen moves by 7 or more yen in less than 6 weeks. Using\nthe USDJPY as a barometer, 7 yen would be equivalent to 700 pips, which\nwould represent a move from 120.00 to 127.00.\n2.Current USDJPY rate —Historically, only 11% of all BoJ interventions that\nwere conducted to counter a strong JPY occurred above the 115 level.\n3.Speculative positions— In order to maximize the impact of intervention, the\nBoJ and MoF prefer to intervene when market participants hold massive\npositions in the opposing direction because the ﬂow of stops will exacerbate\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)243the reversal in the currency pair. The CFTC provides a weekly report on\nexisting speculative positions that can be found at www.cftc.gov.\n■JPY movements are sensitive to time . The Japanese yen can be particularly active\ntowards the end of Japan’s ﬁscal year (March 31), as exporters repatriate their\ndollar denominated assets to window dress their balance sheets. This is particularly\nimportant for Japanese banks because they need to rebuild their balance sheets\nto meet FSA guidelines that require the banks to mark to market their security\nholdings. In anticipation of the need for repatriation-related purchases, Japanese\nyen speculators frequently bid the yen higher in attempt to take advantage of this\nincreased inﬂow. As a result, following ﬁscal year end, the Japanese yen tends to\nhave a bias toward depreciation as speculators close their positions.\nAside from the ﬁscal year end, time is also a factor on a day-to-day basis.\nUnlike traders in London or New York who typically have lunch at their trading\ndesk, Japanese traders tend to take hour-long lunches, leaving only a junior trader\nin the ofﬁce. On occasion, this can translate into additional volatility in the yen\nduring this period as the market becomes illiquid. In addition to this period, the\nJPY tends to move fairly orderly during Japanese and London hours, unless there\nare ofﬁcial comments or major surprises in economic data. During U.S. hours,\nhowever, the JPY tends to have higher volatility, as U.S. traders are actively\nengaging in dollar and yen positions.\n■Stocks and bonds have a positive correlation with USDJPY . The Nikkei has a positive\ncorrelation with USDJPY, which means that when the currency pair appreciating,\nequities are generally on the rise as well. For Japan, the currency typically leads\nequities because a weak yen is positive for the economy, but there can be times\nwhen equities lead currencies. The spread between U.S. 10-year Treasury and\nJGB yields is also very important for the currency. Typically, when the yield\nspread is on the rise, we see USDJPY move higher, and when the yield spread\ndeclines, it creates pressure on USDJPY. Figure 30.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of USDJPY.\n■Carry trade effects . The popularity of carry trades has increased in recent years, as\ninvestors are actively seeking high-yielding assets. With the Japanese yen having\nthe lowest interest rate of all industrialized countries, it is the primary currency\nsold or borrowed in carry trades. The most popular carry trade currencies\nincluded GBPJPY, AUDJPY, NZDJPY, and even USDJPY. Carry traders would\ngo short the Japanese yen against the higher yielding currencies. Unwinding of\ncarry trades as result of spread narrowing is typically beneﬁcial for the Japanese\nyen, as the reversal process involves purchasing the yen and buying back other\ncurrencies. Since there is so much demand to sell the yen for carry, in periods of\nrisk aversion, these trades can be unwound quickly creating a signiﬁcant rally in\nthe currency.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)244■Important Economic Indicators for Japan\nSince Japan is a manufacturing-oriented economy, manufacturing data tend to have\nthe most signiﬁcant impact on the yen. However, on a monthly basis, unless there is\na big surprise, Japanese data do not typically move the currency. The most inﬂuential\nevent risk is always the monetary policy announcement and trade balance. Aside\nfrom that, these are the numbers to watch.\nTankan Survey\nIf there is one piece of Japanese data to follow, it should be the quarterly Tankan\nReport. The Tankan is an economic survey of Japanese enterprises published four\ntimes a year. The survey includes more than 9,000 enterprises, which are divided\ninto four major groups: large, small, and medium-sized companies, as well as\nprincipal enterprises. The survey provides us with an overall impression of the\nbusiness climate in Japan and is widely watched and anticipated by foreign exchange\nmarket participants.\nBalance of Payments\nThe monthly balance of payments report provides investors with insight into Japan’s\ninternational economic transactions that include goods, services, investment income,\nand capital ﬂows. The current account side of BoJ can be used a good gauge of\ninternational trade. Figures are released on a monthly and semiannual basis.\nEmployment\nEmployment ﬁgures are reported on a monthly basis by the Management and\nCoordination Agency of Japan. The employment release measures the number of\njobs and unemployment rate for the country as a whole. The data are obtained\nthrough a statistical survey of the current labor force. This release is a closely\nwatched economic indicator because of its timeliness and its importance as a leading\nindicator of economic activity.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures trends in the output of Japanese\nmanufacturing, mining, and utilities companies. Output refers to the total quantity\nof items produced. The index covers the production of goods for domestic sales\nin Japan and for export. It excludes production in the agriculture, construction,\ntransportation, communication, trade, ﬁnance, and service industries; government\noutput; and imports. The IP index is then developed by weighting each component\naccording to its relative importance during this base period. Investors feel IP and\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)\nk\nk245\nk\nk\nFIGURE 30.1 USDJPY 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)246inventory accumulation have strong correlations with total output and can provide\nvaluable insight into the current state of the economy.\nGDP\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a broad measure of the total production and\nconsumption of goods and services measured over quarterly and yearly periods in\nJapan. GDP is measured by adding total expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. Preliminary reports\nare the most signiﬁcant for FX market participants.\n247CHAPTER 31\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nAustralian Dollar\n(AUD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nAustralia is the twelfth largest country in the world, with a gross domestic product\nof approximately US$1.5 trillion. In Asia, it ranks as the third largest economy\nin the region. On a relative basis, the economy is very small, only one-tenth\nthat of the United States and less than one-ﬁfth the size of China. However on a\nper capita basis, Australia ranks right up there with many industrialized Western\nEuropean countries. Australia has a service-oriented economy with close to 70%\nof GDP coming from industries such as ﬁnance, property, and business services.\nHowever, the country has a trade deﬁcit, with manufacturing dominating the\ncountry’s exporting activities. Rural and mineral exports account for over 60% of all\nmanufacturing exports and 12% of GDP. The economy is therefore highly sensitive\nto changes in commodity prices. As a country heavily dependent on exports, the\npace of growth of Australia’s largest trade partners is extremely important because\ndownturns or rapid growth abroad can impact import and export demand. Here’s a\nbreakdown of Australia’s most important trading partners:\nL a r g e s tE x p o r tM a r k e t s\n1. China\n2. Japan\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)2483. South Korea\n4. United States\n5. New Zealand\nLargest Import Sources\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. Japan\n4. Singapore\n5. Germany\nAs you can see, Australia’s number one trading partner is China. In fact, Chinese\ndemand represents a third of the country’s trade activity. In terms of products, the\nChinese are major importers of Australian iron ore, coal, natural gas, and gold.\nAsia Pac is extremely important to Australia, as more than 70% of its exports are\ndestined for countries within the region. This makes Australia’s economy highly\nsensitive to the performance of countries in the Asian Paciﬁc region. Hiccups in\nChina’s economy can have a signiﬁcant impact on Australia, not only in terms of\nexporting activities but also on housing market activity. At the same time, growth in\nChina is positive for Australia’s economy. During the global ﬁnancial crisis, exports\nto China helped shelter Australia from a major downturn. The relationship between\nChina and Australia is known as Sino-Australian relations. China has recently taken\nsteps to produce its own resources, and if this trend continues, it could dramatically\nchange the landscape of Australia’s economy.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is the central bank of Australia. The monetary\npolicy committee within the central bank consists of the governor (chairman), the\ndeputy governor (vice chairman), secretary to the treasurer, and six independent\nmembers appointed by the government. Changes to monetary policy are made on\nconsensus within the committee.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nThe RBA’s charter states t hat the mandate of the Reserve Bank Board is to focus\nmonetary and banking policy on ensuring:\n1. The stability of the currency of Australia;\n2. The maintenance of full employment in Australia; and\n3. The economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)249In order to achieve these objectives, the government has set an informal consumer\nprice inﬂation target of 2% to 3% per year. The RBA believes that the key to long-\nterm sustainable growth in the economy is to control inﬂation, which would preserve\nthe value of money. In addition, an inﬂation target provides a discipline for monetary\npolicy making and guidelines for private-sector inﬂation expectations. This also\nincreases the transparency of the banks’ activities. Should inﬂation or inﬂation\nexpectations exceed the 2% to 3% target, traders should know that it would raise\nred ﬂags at the RBA and prompt the central bank to favor a tighter monetary policy\nor, in the other words, further rate hikes.\nMonetary policy decisions involve setting the interest rate on overnight loans\nin the money market. Other interest rates in the economy are inﬂuenced by this\ninterest rate to varying degrees, so that the behavior of borrowers and lenders in\nthe ﬁnancial markets is affected by monetary policy (though not only by monetary\npolicy). Through these channels, monetary policy affects the economy in pursuit of\nthe goals just outlined.\nCash Rate\nThe cash rate is the RBA’s target rate for open market operations and is the rate\ncharged on overnight loans between ﬁnancial intermediaries. This means the cash\nrate should have a close relationship with the prevailing money market interest rates.\nChanges in monetary policy directly affect the interest rate structure of the ﬁnancial\nsystem. They also affect sentiment in a currency. Figure 31.1 graphs the AUDUSD\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.01. 2\n1. 1\n1. 0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n6/4/10 6/4/11 6/4/12AUDUSD vs. AU-US 10 Year Spread\n6/4/13 6/4/14 6/4/15\nAU-US Spread AUDUSD\nFIGURE 31.1 AUDUSD vs. 10-Year Yield Spread\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)250against the interest rate differential between Australia and the United States between\n2010 and 2015. There is clearly a positive c orrelation between the 10-year yield\nspread and the currency. Between June 2014 and June 2015, for example, the yield\nspread dropped from 1.5% to 0.5%, and thi s coincided with a drop in the AUDUSD\nfrom 95 to 76 cents.\nMaintaining the Cash Rate: Open Market Operations\nThe focus of daily open market operations is to keep the cash rate close to the target,\nby managing money market liquidity provided to commercial banks. If the Reserve\nBank wishes to decrease the cash rate, it would increase supply of short-dated\nrepurchase agreements at a lower interest rate than the prevailing cash rate, which\nwould in essence decrease the cash rate. If the Reserve Bank wishes to increase\nthe cash rate, it would decrease supply of short-dated repurchase agreements,\nwhich would increase the cash rate. A repurchase agreement involves a cash taker\n(commercial bank) selling securities to a cash provider (RBA), while agreeing to\nrepurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date. This structure\nis similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the cash provider\ninterest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities, ranging from\none day to a few weeks.\nAustralia has had a ﬂoating exchange rate since 1983, and the Reserve Bank\nof Australia may undertake foreign exchange market operations when the market\nthreatens to become excessively volatile or when the exchange rate is clearly\ninconsistent with underlying economic fundamentals. The RBA monitors a trade-\nweighted index (TWI), as well as the cross-rate with the U.S. dollar. Intervention\noperations are invariably aimed at stabilizing market conditions rather than meeting\nexchange rate targets.\nMonetary Policy Meetings\nThe RBA meets every month (except for January), on the ﬁrst Tuesday of each\nmonth, to discuss potential changes in monetary policy. Following each meeting, the\nRBA issues a press release outlining justiﬁcations for its monetary policy changes.\nIf it leaves rates unchanged, no statement is published. The RBA also publishes a\nmonthly Reserve Bank Bulletin . The May and November issues of the Reserve Bank\nBulletin include the semiannual statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy. The\nFebruary, May, August, and November issues contain a Quarterly Report on the\nEconomy and Financial Markets. It is important to read these bulletins for signals on\npotential monetary policy changes.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)251Important Characteristics of the Australian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . Historically, the Australian dollar has had a very strongly\ncorrelation (approximately 80%) with commodity prices and, more speciﬁcally,\ngold and iron ore prices. The correlation stems from the fact that Australia is\nthe world’s second largest gold producer and the world’s largest producer of\niron ore. Therefore, the price of iron ore and gold is extremely important to\nAustralia’s economy. However, unless there is a sharp movement in gold or\niron ore prices, it generally takes time for the AUDUSD to adjust to changes in\nthe price of commodities. Generally speaking, if commodity prices are strong,\ninﬂationary fears start to appear, and the RBA would be inclined to raise rates to\ncurb inﬂation. However, this is a sensitive topic, as gold prices tend to increase\nin times of global economic or political uncertainty. If the RBA increases rates\nduring those conditions, it leaves Australia more vulnerable to spillover effects.\n■Carry trade effects . Australia has one of highest interest rates among the developed\ncountries. With a fairly liquid currency, the Australian dollar is one of the most\npopular currencies to use for carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or\nlending a currency with a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency\nwith a low interest rate. The popularity of the carry trade has contributed to the\n57% rise of the Australian dollar aga inst the U.S. dolla r between 2001 and 2005.\nWhile the carry trade suffered great ly in 2008, it came back strongly between\n2009 and 2011. During this time, many foreign investors were looking for high\nyield when equity investments offered minimal returns. However, carry trades\nonly last as long as the actual yield advantage remains. If global central banks\nincrease their interest rates and the positive interest rate differential between\nAustralia and other countries narro w, the AUDUSD could s uffer from an exodus\nof carry traders.\n■Drought effects . Since the majority of Australia’s exports are commodities, the\ncountry’s GDP is highly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage\nthe country’s farming activities. For example, 2002 was a particularly difﬁcult\nyear for Australia, because the country was experiencing a severe drought. The\ndrought took an extreme toll on Australia’s farming activities, with dry conditions\nhampering the economy throughout the twenty-ﬁrst century. This is important\nbecause agriculture accounts for 3% of the country’s GDP. The RBA estimates\nthat the ‘‘decline in farm production could directly reduce GDP growth by\naround 1 percentage point.’’ Aside from exporting activities, a drought also has\nindirect effects on other aspects of Australia’s economy. Industries that supply and\nservice agriculture, such as the wholesale and transport sectors, as well as retail\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)252operations in rural farming areas, may also be negatively affected by a drought.\nHowever, it is also important to note that the Australian economy has a history\nof recovering strongly after a drought. The 1982–1983 drought ﬁrst subtracted\nthen subsequently added around 1% to 1 1∕2% to GDP growth. The 1991–1995\ndrought reduced GDP by around 1∕2to3∕4percentage points in 1991–1992 and\n1994–1995, but the recovery boosted GDP by 3∕4percentage points.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of Australia\nand the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries should\nalso be closely watched by Australian dollar traders. These differentials can be\ngood indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much premium\nyield Australian dollar short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Australia\nGDP\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services\nin Australia. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Australia ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth generally coincides with a\nweak growth period.\nCPI\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a basket\nof goods and services, which account for a high proportion of expenditure by the\nCPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation, and\nhealth. This is an important indicator to watch, as it is a key input for monetary\npolicy decisions.\nBalance of Goods and Services\nThis number is a monthly measure of Australia’s international trade in goods and\nservices on a balance of payments basis. General merchandise imports and exports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)\nk\nk253\nk\nk\nFIGURE 31.2 AUDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)254are derived mainly from international trade statistics, which are based on Australian\nCustoms Service records. The current account is the balance of trade plus services.\nPrivate Consumption\nThis is a national accounts measure that reﬂects current expenditure by households\nand producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes purchases of\ndurable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure by persons\non the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by unincorporated\nenterprises. This number is important to watch, as private consumption or consumer\nconsumption is the foundation for resilience in the Australian economy.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average\nchanges in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI\ntracks changes in prices for nearly every goods-producing industry in the domestic\neconomy, including agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries,\nmanufacturing, and mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally\nadjusted ﬁnished goods PPI and how the index has reacted on an m/m, q/q, h/h\nand y/y basis. Australia’s PPI data are released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 31.2 illustrates the 10 year performance of AUDUSD.\n255CHAPTER 32\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nNew Zealand Dollar\n(NZD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nNew Zealand is a very small economy with GDP valued at approximately\nUS$183 billion in 2013. In fact, there are less people living in New Zealand\nthan in New York City. It was once one of the most regulated countries within\nthe OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), but over\nthe past two decades the country has been moving toward a more open, modern,\nand stable economy. With the passing of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994, the\ncountry is shifting from an agricultural farming community to one that seeks to\nbecome a leading knowledge-based economy with high skills, high employment,\nand high value-added production. This act sets legal standards that hold the govern-\nment formally responsible to the public for its ﬁscal performance. It also sets the\nframework for the country’s macroeconomic policies. The following are the ﬁve\nprinciples outlined under the Fiscal Responsibility Act:\n1. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; by achieving surpluses on the\noperating budget every year until such a level is reached.\n2. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; and the government must ensure\nthat expenditure is lower than revenue.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)2563. Sufﬁcient levels of Crown net worth must be achieved and maintained to guard\nagainst adverse future events.\n4. Reasonable taxation policies must be followed.\n5. Fiscal risks facing the government must be prudently managed.\nNew Zealand also has highly developed manufacturing and services sectors,\nwith the agricultural industry driving the bulk of the country’s exports. The\neconomy is strongly trade-oriented, with exports of goods and services representing\napproximately one third of GDP. Due to the small size of the economy and its\nsigniﬁcant trade activities, New Zealand is highly sensitive to global performance,\nespecially of its key Asian trading partners, Australia, China, United States, and Japan.\nTogether, Australia, China, and Japan represent 42% of New Zealand’s trading\nactivity. It is also extremely sensitive to exchange rate ﬂuctuations, particularly\nagainst the Australian dollar. The fo llowing lists are a breakdown of the New\nZealand’s most important trading partners:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Australia\n2. China\n3. European Union\n4. United States\n5. Japan\nLeading Import Sources\n1. European Union\n2. China\n3. Australia\n4. United States\n5. Japan\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Reserve\nBank of New Zealand\nMonetary policy in New Zealand is determined by the Reserve Bank (RBNZ).\nThe Monetary Policy Committee is an internal committee of bank executives who\nreview monetary policy on a weekly basis. Meetings to decide on changes to\nmonetary policy occur eight ti mes a year, or approximate ly every six weeks. Unlike\nmost other central banks, the decision for rate changes rests ultimately on the bank’s\ngovernor. The current policy target agreements set by the minister and the governor\nfocus on maintaining policy stability and avoiding unnecessary instability in output,\ninterest rates, and the exchange rate. Price stability refers to maintaining the annual\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)257CPI inﬂation at 1.5%. If the RBNZ does not meet this target, the government has\nthe ability to dismiss the governor of the RBNZ. This is rarely done, but this serves\nas a strong incentive for the RBNZ to meets its inﬂation target. The most common\ntools used by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy changes are the following.\nOfﬁcial Cash Rate (OCR)\nThe Ofﬁcial Cash Rate is the rate set by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy.\nThe Bank lends overnight cash at 25 basis points above the OCR rate and receives\ndeposits or pays interest at 25 basis points below this rate. By controlling the cost\nof liquidity for commercial banks, the RBNZ can inﬂuence the interest rates offered\nto individuals and corporations. This effectively creates a 50 basis point corridor\nthat bounds the interbank overnight rate. The idea is then that banks offering funds\nabove the upper bound will attract few takers, because funds can be borrowed for\na lower cost from the RBNZ. Also, banks offering rates below the lower bound\nwill also attract few takers, because they are offering lower yields than the RBNZ.\nThe ofﬁcial cash rate is reviewed and manipulated with the goal of maintaining\neconomic stability.\nObjectives for Fiscal Policy\nOpen market operations on the other hand are used to meet the cash target. The\ncash target is the targeted amount of reserves held by registered banks. The RBNZ\nprepares forecasts of daily ﬂuctuations on the cash target and will then use these\nforecasts to determine the amount of funds to inject or withdraw in order to meet\nthe cash target. The following government objectives provide a guideline for ﬁscal\nand monetary policy measures:\n■Expenses : Expenses will average around 35% of GDP over the horizon used to\ncalculate contributions toward future New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) costs.\nDuring the buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs, expenses plus contributions\nwill be around 35% of GDP. In the longer term, expenses less withdrawals to\nmeet NZS costs will be around 35% of GDP.\n■Revenue : Raise sufﬁcient revenue to meet the operating balance objective. A\nrobust, broad-based tax system that raises revenue in a fair and efﬁcient way.\n■Operating balance : Operating surplus on average over the economic cycle sufﬁcient\nto meet the requirements for contributions toward future NZS costs and ensure\nconsistency with the debt objective.\n■Debt: Gross debt below 30% of GDP on average over the economic cycle. Net\ndebt, which excludes the assets to meet future NZS costs, below 20% of GDP on\naverage over the economic cycle.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)258■Net worth : Increase net worth consistent with the operating balance objective.\nThis will be achieved through a buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs.\nSource: New Zealand Treasury\n■Important Characteristics of the New Zealand\nDollar\nStrong Correlation with AUD—Competition with Australia\nAustralia is New Zealand’s largest trading partner. This coupled with their geographic\nproximity and New Zealand’s high dependence on trade, creates strong ties between\nthe economies of the two countries. When the Australian economy is healthy and\nAustralian corporations increase their importing activities, New Zealand will be one\nof the ﬁrst to beneﬁt. When it is weak, New Zealand suffers but in recent years\nits sensitivity has diminished because of the country’s growing trade with China\nand other nations. Nonetheless, 22% of trade is still conducted with Australia,\nand this explains why there is a positive correlation between the two currencies.\nFigure 32.1 shows how closely AUDUS D and NZDUSD have moved between 2005\nand 2015.\nCommodity-Linked Currency\nNew Zealand is an export driven economy with commodities representing over\n40% of the country’s exports, and as a result the New Zealand dollar has a strong\ncorrelation with commodity prices, particularly dairy. Fonterra is one of the world’s\n1. 2\n1. 1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.4AUDUSD vs. NZDUSD\n6/30/05 6/30/06 6/30/07 6/30/08 6/30/09 6/30/10 6/30/11 6/30/12 6/30/13 6/30/140.5\nAUDUSD NZDUSD\nFIGURE 32.1 AUDUSD versus NZDUSD\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)259leading dairy producer and also largest company in New Zealand. Twice a month\nthe Global Dairy Trade will conduct an auction and if prices rise, it will be positive\nfor the New Zealand dollar. If prices fall, it will be negative for the currency\nbecause it can mean reduced payout and proﬁt for dairy producers. The correlation\nbetween Australian and New Zealand dollars also contributes to the NZD’s status as a\n‘‘commodity linked’’ currency. Therefore, the New Zealand dollar’s correlation with\ncommodity prices is not only limited to its own trade activities. Therefore, as com-\nmodity prices increase, the Australian economy beneﬁts, translating into increased\nactivity in all aspects of the country’s operations, including trade with New Zealand.\nCarry Trades\nOf the industrialized countries, New Zealand tends to maintain the highest interest\nrate as it needs to offer investors a higher yield to compensate for the risk of\ninvesting in a small economy. This yield advantage along with its secure credit rating\nhas made the New Zealand dollar one of the most popular currencies to purchase\nfor carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. The\npopularity of the carry trade has contributed to the rise of the New Zealand dollar in\nan environment where many global investors are looking for opportunities to earn\nhigh yield. However, this also makes the New Zealand dollar particularly sensitive\nto changes in interest rates. That is, when the United States begins increasing their\ninterest rates, while New Zealand stays on hold or reduces their interest rates, the\ncarry advantage of the New Zealand dollar would narrow. In such situations, the\nNew Zealand dollar could come under pressure as speculators reverse their carry\ntrade positions.\nInterest Rate Differentials\nInterest rate differentials between the cash rates of New Zealand and the short\nterm interest rate yields of other industrialized countries are closely watched by\nprofessional NZD traders. These differentials can be good indicators of potential\nmoney ﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield NZD short-term ﬁxed-\nincome assets are offering over foreign short-term ﬁxed income assets, or vice versa.\nThis differential provides traders with indications of potential currency movements,\nas investors are always looking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly\nimportant to carry traders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive\ninterest rate differentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\nPopulation Migration\nAs mentioned earlier, New Zealand has a very small population, less than half of\nNew York City. Therefore, changes in migration can have signiﬁcant effects on the\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)260economy. Between 2013 an d 2014, the population of New Zealand increased by\n78,800 people, which was the largest net migration in at least 90 years. Between\n2011 and 2012, for example, the population only grew by 26,400 people. Although\nthese absolute numbers appear small, it is fairly signiﬁcant for New Zealand because\nof the size of the population. In fact, this strong population migration into New\nZealand has contributed signiﬁcantly to the performance of the economy, because\nas the population increases, the demand for household goods increases, leading to\nan increase in overall consumer consumption.\nDrought Effects\nSince the bulk of New Zealand’s exports are commodities, the country’s GDP is\nhighly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage the country’s farming\nactivities. In 2013, droughts cost the country over $1.3 billion. In addition, droughts\nare also very frequent in Australia, New Zealand’s largest trading partner, and when\nthey occur it can have a negative impact on the New Zealand economy.\n■Important Economic Indicators for New Zealand\nNew Zealand does not release economic indicators often; however, when they do,\nthe following items are the most important:\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a quarterly measure of the total production and consumption of goods and\nservices in New Zealand. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households,\nbusinesses, government, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used\nto convert output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. This data are\nused to gauge where in the business cycle New Zealand ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often\nis perceived inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nConsumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a\n‘‘basket’’ of goods and services that account for a high proportion of expenditure by\nthe CPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation,\nand health. This is an important indicator to watch, as monetary policy changes are\nhighly inﬂuenced by this index as it is a measure of inﬂation.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)\nk\nk261\nk\nk\nFIGURE 32.2 NZDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)262Balance of Goods and Services\nNew Zealand’s Balance of Payments statements are records of the value of New\nZealand’s transactions in goods, services, income, and transfers with the rest of the\nworld, and the changes in New Zealand’s ﬁnancial claims on (assets), and liabilities\nto, the rest of the world. New Zealand’s International Investment Position statement\nshows, at a particular point in time, the stock of a country’s international ﬁnancial\nassets and international ﬁnancial liabilities.\nRetail Sales Ex Inﬂation\nCredit card spending numbers are released for New Zealand on a monthly basis but\nthe retail sales data is quarterly on an ex inﬂation basis. This measure tracks the\nresale of new and used goods to the public for personal or household consumption.\nIt is also an important input into GDP.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a m/m, q/q, h/h, and y/y basis. New\nZealand’s PPI data is released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 32.2 illustrates the 10-year performance of NZDUSD.\n263CHAPTER 33\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nCanadian Dollar\n(CAD)\n■Broad Economic Performance\nCanada is the world’s eleventh largest country with GDP valued at US$1.8 trillion as\nof 2014. As a resource-based economy, the country’s early economic development\nhinged on the development, exploitation, and exports of natural resources. It is\nnow the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold. However, in actuality,\nnearly two-thirds of the country’s GDP comes from the service sector, which also\nemploys three out of four Canadians. The strength in the service sector is partly\nattributed to the trend by businesses to subcontract a large portion of their services.\nThis may include a manufacturing company subcontracting delivery services to a\ntransportation company. Despite this, manufacturing and resources are still very\nimportant for the Canadian economy, as it represents over 25% of the country’s\nexports and is a primary source of income for a number of provinces.\nThe Canadian economy started to advance with the depreciation of its currency\nagainst the U.S. dollar and the Free Trade Agreement that came into effect in January\n1989. This agreement eliminated almost all trade tariffs between the United States\nand Canada. As a result, Canada now exports over 85% of its goods to the United\nStates. Further negotiations to incorporate Mexico created the North American Free\nTrade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect on January 1994. This more advanced\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)264treaty eliminated most tariffs on trading b etween all three countries. Canada’s close\ntrade relationship with the United States makes it particularly sensitive to the health\nof the U.S. economy. If the U.S. economy sputters, demand for Canadian exports\nwould suffer. The same is true for the opposite scenario; if U.S. economic growth\nis robust, Canadian exports will beneﬁt. In the past decade, trade with China has\nalso increased signiﬁcantly, rising in the ranks from the ﬁfth to the second most\nimportant trade partner for Canada. The following is a breakdown of Canada’s key\nexport and import markets:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. United Kingdom\n4. Japan\n5. Mexico\nLeading Import Sources\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Japan\n4. Mexico\n5. United Kingdom\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Governing Council of the Bank of Canada is the board that is responsible for\nsetting Canadian monetary policy. This council consists of seven members: the\ngovernor and six deputy governors. The Bank of Canada meets approximately eight\ntimes per year to discuss changes in monetary policy. They also release a monthly\nmonetary policy update every quarter, but the rate decision itself is the big market\nmover for the currency.\nCentral Bank Goals\nThe Bank of Canada’s primary focus is on maintaining the ‘‘integrity and value of\nthe currency,’’ and this involves ensuring pri ce stability. Price stability is maintained\nby adhering to an inﬂation target currently set by the Department of Finance at\n1% to 3%. The Bank believes that high inﬂation can damage the functioning of the\neconomy. In their opinion, low inﬂation on the other hand equates to price stability,\nwhich can help to foster sustainable long-term economic growth. The BoC controls\ninﬂation through short-term interest rates. If inﬂation is above the target, the Bank\nwill apply tighter monetary conditions. If it is below the target, the Bank will loosen\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)265monetary policy. Overall, the central bank has done a pretty good job of keeping\nthe inﬂation target within the band since 1998.\nThe Bank measures monetary conditions using its Monetary Conditions Index,\nwhich is a weighted sum of changes in the 90-day commercial paper rate and G-10\ntrade-weighted exchange rates. The weight of the interest rate versus the exchange\nrate is 3 to 1, which is the affect of a chan ge in interest rates on the exchange rate\nbased on historical studies. This means that a 1% increase in short-term interest\nrates is the same as a 3% appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate. To\nchange monetary policy, the BoC manipulates the Bank Rate, which can in turn\naffect the exchange rate. If the currency appreciates to undesirable levels, the BoC\ncan decrease interest rates to offset the rise. If it depreciates, the BoC can raise rates.\nHowever, interest rate changes are not used for the purposes of manipulating the\nexchange rate. Instead, they are used to control inﬂation but an excessively strong\ncurrency and lower inﬂationary pressures can accelerate the changes. The following\nare the most commonly used tools by the BoC to implement monetary policy.\nBank Rate\nThe Bank Rate is the main rate used to control inﬂation. This is the rate of interest\nthat the Bank of Canada charges to commercial banks. Changes to this rate will affect\nother interest rates, including mortgage rates and prime rates charged by commercial\nbanks. Therefore, changes to this rate will ﬁlter into the overall economy.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) is the framework for the Bank of Canada’s\nimplementation of monetary policy. It is through this framework that Canada’s\ncommercial banks borrow and lend overnight money to each other in order to fund\ntheir daily transactions. The LVTS is an electronic platform through which these\nﬁnancial institutions conduct large transactions. The interest rate charged on these\novernight loans is called the overnight rate or bank rate. The BoC can manipulate the\novernight rate by offering to lend at rates lower or higher than the current market\nrate if the overnight lending rate is trading above or below the target banks.\nOn a regular basis, the bank releases a number of publications that are important to\nfollow. This includes a biannual Monetary Policy Report that contains an assessment of\nthe current economic environment and implications for inﬂation and a quarterly Bank\nof Canada Review that includes economic commentary, featured articles, speeches by\nmembers of the Governing Council, and important announcements.\nImportant Characteristics of the Canadian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . As the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold,\nCanada’s economy is highly dependent on commodities. This creates a strong\npositive correlation between the Canadian dollar and oil prices. Generally\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)266speaking, when oil prices rise, it beneﬁts domestic producers and increases their\nincome from exports. However at the same time, strong commodity prices can\nhurt growth abroad; so while rising oil prices are initially positive for Canada,\nthe negative impact on global growth could lead to a decline in demand over the\nmedium term. On the ﬂip side, falling oil prices are negative for the Canadian\ndollar; but if prices remain low and global growth beneﬁts, it can eventually\nneutralize the negative impact.\n■Strong correlation with the United States . Since the 1980s, Canada has been running\nmerchandise trade surpluses with the United States and now approximately 77%\nof Canadian exports are bound for the Untied States. This heavy reliance on U.S.,\ndemand makes Canada extremely sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy. As the\nU.S. economy accelerates, trade increases with Canadian companies, lifting overall\neconomic activity. However, as the U.S. economy slows, the Canadian economy\nwill be hurt signiﬁcantly as U.S. companies reduce their importing activities.\n■Mergers and acquisitions . Due to the proximity of the United States and Canada,\ncross-border mergers and acquisitions are very common, as companies worldwide\nstrive for globalization. These mergers and acquisitions lead to money ﬂowing\nbetween the two countries, which ulti mately impacts the currencies. In 2001,\nthe signiﬁcant U.S. acquisition of Canadian energy companies infused US$25\nbillion into Canada. This led to a strong rally in USDCAD, as the U.S. companies\nneeded to sell USD and buy CAD to pay for their acquisitions. Any similar type\nof M&A ﬂow in the future will also have a signiﬁcant but short-term impact on\nthe Canadian dollar.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of\nCanada and the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries\nare closely watched by professional Canadian dollar traders. These differentials\ncan be good indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much\npremium yield Canadian short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, and vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Carry trades . A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. When\nCanada has a higher interest rate than th e United States, the short USDCAD carry\ntrade becomes more attractive; but if th e United States emba rks on a tightening\ncampaign or Canada lowers rates, the positive interest rate differential between\nthe Canadian dollar and other currencies would narrow. In such situations, the\nCanadian dollar could come under pressure if the speculators begin to exit out of\ntheir carry trades.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)267■Important Economic Indicators for Canada\nCanadian economic reports can have a signiﬁcant impact on the currency. Here are\na handful of the most important releases.\nCanadian Employment\nEvery month, Canada releases its labor market report and this report provides more\ndetails than that of the United States. Job growth is expressed as net job growth and\nthen split into full- and part-time hirers. Generally speaking, the market prefers that\nthe bulk of job growth is full time, because it represents real long-term employment\nand not short-term hires that can be laid off at any time. The unemployment rate is\nalso released, and the number of unemployed persons is expressed as a percentage\nof the labor force.\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\nThe monthly consumer price report measures the average rate of increase in prices.\nWhen economists speak of inﬂation as an economic problem, they generally mean\na persistent increase in the general price level over a period of time, resulting in a\ndecline in a currency’s purchasing power. Inﬂation is often measured as a percentage\nincrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Canada’s inﬂation policy, as set out\nby the federal government and the Bank of Canada, aims to keep inﬂation within\na target range of 1% to 3%. If the rate of inﬂation is 10% a year, $100 worth of\npurchases last year will, on average, cost $110 this year. At the same inﬂation rate,\nthose purchases will cost $121 next year, and so on.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nThe gross domestic product measures the total value of all goods and services\nproduced within Canada during a given year. It is a measure of the income generated\nby production within Canada. GDP is also referred to as economic output. To\navoid counting the same output more than once, GDP includes only ﬁnal goods\nand services—not those that are used to make another product. For example, GDP\nwould not include the wheat used to make bread, but would include the bread itself.\nTrade Balance\nThe balance of trade is a statement of a country’s trade in goods (merchandise) and\nservices. It covers trade in products such as manufactured goods, raw materials, and\nagricultural goods, as well as travel and transportation. The balance of trade is the\ndifference between the value of the goods and services that a country exports and\nthe value of the goods and services that it imports. If a country’s exports exceed its\nimports, it has a trade surplus and the trade balance is said to be positive. If imports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)268\nFIGURE 33.1 USDCAD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nexceed exports, the country has a trade deﬁcit, and its trade balance is said to be\nnegative.\nRetail Sales\nRetail sales is a monthly national accounts measure that calculates current expenditure\nby households and producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes\npurchases of durable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure\nby persons on the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by\nunincorporated enterprises. Stronger consumer spending is positive for Canada’s\neconomy and, in turn, the Canadian dollar, whereas weaker consumer spending is\nnegative for Canada’s economy and currency.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.\nFigure 33.1 illustrates the 10-year

        "xiABOUT THE AUTHOR\nKathy Lien is managing director of FX strategy for BK Asset Management and\nco-founder of BKForex.com. As a ﬁnancial market prodigy, she graduated from\nNew York University’s Stern School of Business at the age of 18. After graduation,\nshe joined JPMorgan Chase’s interbank foreign exchange trading desk. This early\nstart has given Kathy more than 15 years of experience in the foreign exchange\nmarket. At JPMorgan, she helped to make markets in G20 currencies and later\nmoved to the bank’s cross markets proprietary trading group where she traded FX\nspot, options, interest rate derivatives, bonds, equities, and futures.\nIn 2003, Kathy joined FXCM and started DailyFX.com, a leading online foreign\nexchange research portal. As chief strategist, she managed a team of 10 analysts\ndedicated to providing research and commentary on the foreign exchange market.\nIn 2008, Kathy joined Global Futures & Forex Ltd as director of Currency Research,\nwhere she provided research and analysis to clients and managed a global foreign\nexchange research team with analysts in the United States, London, and Japan. In\n2012, she became an ofﬁcial CNBC contributor and served as a guest host for Money\nin Motion .\nAs an expert in G20 currencies, Kathy travels around the world teaching investors\nto trade forex. She is often quoted in the Wall Street Journal, UK Telegraph, andSydney\nMorning Herald , and by Reuters, Bloomberg, Marketwatch, Associated Press, AAP,\nand other leading news sources. She also appears regularly on CNBC US, Asia, and\nEurope, and on Sky Business.\nKathy is an internationally published author of the best-selling book Day Trading\nand Swing Trading the Currency Market; The Little Book of Currency Trading; andMillionaire\nABOUT THE AUTHORxiiTraders: How Everyday People Beat Wall Street at Its Own Game —all published through\nWiley.\nKathy’s extensive experience in cross-markets analysis, trading strategy devel-\nopment, and predicting economic data surprises has made her known in the forex\ncommunity as the ‘‘queen of the macro forex trade.’’\n1CHAPTER 1\nForeign Exchange—\nThe Fastest Growing\nMarket of Our Time\nThe foreign exchange market is the largest and fastest growing market in the\nworld. Traditionally, it is the platform through which governments, businesses,\ninvestors, travelers, and other interested parties convert or ‘‘exchange’’ currency.\nAt its most fundamental level, the foreign exchange market is an over-the-counter\n(OTC) market with no central exchange and clearing house where orders are\nmatched. FX dealers and market makers around the world are linked to each other\naround-the-clock via telephone, computer, and fax, creating one cohesive market.\nThrough the years, this has changed with many institutions offering exchange traded\nFX instruments, but all of the prices are still derived from the underlying or spot\nforex market.\nIn the past two decades, foreign exchange, also known as forex orFX,became\navailable to trade by individual retail investors, and this access caused the market\nto explode in popularity. In the early 2000s, the Bank of International Settlements\nreported a 57% increase in volume between Ap ril 2001 and 2004. At the time more\nthan $1.9 trillion were changing hands on a daily basis. After the ﬁnancial crisis in\n2008, the pace of growth eased to a still- respectable 32% between 2010 and 2013,\nbut the actual volume that changed hands was signiﬁcantly larger at an average of\n$5.3 trillion per day. To put this into perspective, it is 50 times greater than the\ndaily trading volume of the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ combined.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET2While the growth of the retail foreign exchange market contributed to this surge\nin volume, an increase in volatility over the past few years also made investors\nmore aware of how currency movements can impact the equity and bond markets.\nIf stocks, bonds, and commodity traders want to make more educated trading\ndecisions, it is important for them to also follow forex movements. What follows\nare some of the examples of how currency ﬂuctuations impacted stock and bond\nmarket movements in past years.\n■EURUSD and Corporate Proﬁtability\nFor stock market traders, particularly those who invest in European corporations that\nexport a tremendous amount of goods to the United States, monitoring exchange\nrates are essential to predicting earnings and corporate proﬁtability. Throughout 2003\nand 2004, European manufacturers complained extensively about the rapid rise in the\neuro and the weakness in the U.S. dollar. The main culprit for the dollar’s selloff at\nthe time was the country’s rapidly growing trade and budget deﬁcits. This caused the\nEURUSD exchange rate to surge, which took a signiﬁcant toll on the proﬁtability of\nEuropean corporations because a higher exchange rate makes the goods of European\nexporters more expensive to U.S. consumers. In 2003, inadequate hedging shaved\napproximately EUR$1 billion euros from Volkswagen’s proﬁts, while DSM, a Dutch\nchemicals group, warned that a 1% move in the EURUSD rate would reduce proﬁts\nby EUR$7 million to EUR$11 million. Unfortunately, inadequate hedging is still a\nreality in Europe, which makes monitoring the EURUSD exchange rate even more\nimportant in forecasting the earnings and proﬁtability of European exporters.\n■Nikkei and U.S. Dollar\nTraders exposed to Japanese equities also need to be aware of the developments\nthat are occurring in the U.S. dollar and ho w that affects the Nikkei rally. Japan\nrecently came out of 10 years of stagnation. During this time, mutual funds and\nhedge funds were grossly underweight Japanese equities. When the economy began\nto turn around, global macro funds rushed to make changes to their portfolios in fear\nof missing out on a great opportunity to take advantage of Japan’s recovery. Hedge\nfunds borrowed signiﬁcant amount of dollars to pay for increased exposure, but the\nproblem was that their borrowings were very sensitive to U.S. interest rates and the\nFed’s monetary policy tightening cycle. Increased borrowing costs forthe dollar could\nderail the Nikkei’s rally because higher rates will raise the dollar’s ﬁnancing costs. Yet\nwith the huge current account deﬁcit, the Fed might need to continue raising rates\nto increase the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Therefore, continual\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET3rate hikes, coupled with slowing growth in Japan, may make it less proﬁtable for\nfunds to be overleveraged and overly exposed to Japanese stocks. As a result, how\nthe U.S. dollar moves also plays a role on the future direction of the Nikkei.\n■George Soros\nKnown as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England,’’ George Soros is one of\nthe most well-known traders in the FX market. We discuss his adventures in\nmore detail in Chapter 2, but in a nutshell, in 1990, England decided to join\nthe Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) system because it wanted to take part in\nthe stable and low-inﬂation environment created by the Bundesbank, the central\nbank of Germany. This alliance tied the pound to the deutschmark, which meant\nthat the United Kingdom was subject to the monetary policies enforced by the\nBundesbank. In the early 1990s, Germany aggressively increased interest rates to\navoid the inﬂationary effects related to German reuniﬁcation. However, national\npride and the commitment of ﬁxing exchange rates within the ERM prevented\nEngland from devaluing the pound. On Wednesday, September 16, also known as\nBlack Wednesday, George Soros leveraged the entire value of his fund ($1 billion) and\nsold $10 billion worth of pounds to bet against the ERM. This essentially ‘‘broke’’\nthe Bank of England and forced it to devalue the pound. In a matter of 24 hours, the\nBritish pound fell approximately 5%, or 5000 pips. The Bank of England promised\nto raise rates in order to tempt speculators to buy pounds. As a result, this caused\ntremendous volatility in the bond markets, with 1-month UK LIBOR rates rising\n1% and then retracing those gains over the next 24 hours. If bond traders were\ncompleted oblivious to what was going on in the currency markets, they would have\nprobably found themselves dumbstruck in face of such rapid gyration in yields.\n■Chinese Yuan Revaluation and Bonds\nFor Treasury traders, there’s another currency-related issue that is important to\nfollow and that is the gradual revaluation of the Chinese yuan. For most of its history,\nthe yuan or renminbi (RMB) was pegged to the U.S. dollar. In the 1980s, the RMB\nwas devalued to promote growth in C hina’s economy, and between 1997 and 2005\nthe People’s Bank of China artiﬁcially maintained a USDRMB rate of 8.27. At the\ntime, it received signiﬁcant criticism because keeping the peg meant that the Chinese\ngovernment would artiﬁcially weaken its currency to make Chinese goods more\ncompetitive. To maintain the band, the Chinese government had to sell the yuan and\nbuy U.S. dollars each time their currency appreciated above the band’s upper limit.\nThese dollars were then used to purchase U.S. Treasuries, and this practice turned\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET4China into the world’s largest holder of U.S. Treasuries. In 2005, however, China\nended its dollar peg and linked the value of the yuan to a basket of currencies and\nallowed it to ﬂuctuate within a narrow band that was reset every day. While the exact\npercentage of the basket is unknown, it is largely dominated by the U.S. dollar and\nincludes other currencies such as the euro, Japanese yen, South Korean won, British\npound, Thai baht, Russian ruble, and Australian, Canadian, and Singapore dollar.\nThrough the years China has gradually widened the band that the yuan can trade\nin, but if China were to end the ﬂoat and allow the RMB to trade freely on the\nglobal foreign exchange market, the impact on the ﬁxed-income markets would be\nsigniﬁcant because it would reduce the government’s need to purchase Treasuries\nand other ﬁxed-income securities. An announcement of this sort would send yields\nsoaring and prices tumbling. While it could be years before this happens, it will be\nimportant for bond investors to follow these developments if they want to effectively\nmanage the risk.\n■Comparing the FX Market with Futures\nand Equities\nThe foreign exchange market has not always been a popular market to trade because\nfor many decades, it was restricted to hedge funds, commodity trading advisers who\nmanage large amounts of capital, major corporations, and institutional investors\ndue to regulation, capital requirements, and technology. Yet it was the market\nof choice for many of these large players because the risk was fully customizable.\nTrader A could use a 50 times leverage, and Trader B could trade cash on cash.\nWhen the market opened up to retail traders, many brokerage ﬁrms swept in to\nprovide leveraged trading along with free instantaneous execution platforms, charts,\nand real-time news. This access to low-cost information helped foreign exchange\ntrading surge in popularity, increasing its attractiveness as an alternative asset class\nto trade.\nMany equity and futures traders also turned to currencies, adding the asset class\nto their trading portfolios. Before you choose to do so, however, it is important to\nunderstand some of the key difference s between the forex and equity markets.\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs, and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET5Characteristics of Equities Market\n1. There is decent market liquidity, but that can depend on a stock’s daily volume.\n2. The market is only available for trading 9:30am to 5pm NY Time, with limited\nafter-hours trading.\n3. The existence of exchange fees results in higher costs and commissions.\n4. There is an uptick rule to short stocks, which many day traders ﬁnd frustrating.\n5. The number of steps involved in completing a trade can increase slippage and\nerror.\nAs one of the most liquid markets in the world, the volume and liquidity present in\nthe FX markets has allowed traders to access a 24-hour market with low transaction\ncosts, high leverage, the ability to proﬁt in both bull and bear markets, minimized\nerror rates, limited slippage, and no trading curbs or uptick rules. Oftentimes, traders\ncan use the same strategies for analyzing the equity markets in the FX market. Funda-\nmental traders will ﬁnd that countries can be analyzed like stocks. Technical traders\nwill ﬁnd that the FX market is perfect for their style of analysis because of the abun-\ndance of tick data and because it is already one of the most commonly used analysis\ntools by professional traders. Now let’s take a closer look at the individual attributes\nof the FX market to really understand why this is such an attractive market to trade!\n24-Hour Market\nOne of the primary reasons why the FX market is popular is because for active\ntraders, it is the ideal market to trade. It’s 24-hour nature offers traders instant access\nto the markets at all hours of the day for immediate response to global developments.\nThis characteristic also gives traders the added ﬂexibility of determining their own\ntrading day. Active day traders no longer have to wait for the equities market to\nopen at 9:30am NY Time to begin trading. If there is a signiﬁcant announcement or\ndevelopment either domest ically or overseas bet ween 4pm NY Time and 9:30am\nNY Time, most day traders will have to wait for the exchanges to open at 9:30am\nto place trades. In all likelihood, by that time, unless you have access to electronic\ncommunication networks (ECNs) such as Instinet for premarket trading, the market\nwould have gapped up or gapped down against your favor. This is particularly\nfrustrating when important data are released at 8:30am NY Time, such as nonfarm\npayrolls. Professionals would have already priced in the outcome before the average\ntrader can even access to market.\nIn addition, many people who want to trade also have a full-time job during\nthe day. The ability to trade after hours makes the FX market a much more\nconvenient market for all traders. Different times of the day will offer different\ntrading opportunities, as the global ﬁnancial centers around the world are all actively\ninvolved in foreign exchange. With the FX m arket, trading after hours with a large\nonline FX broker provides the same liquidity and spread as any other time of day.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET6As a guideline, at 5pm Sunday NY Time, trading begins as the markets open in\nSydney, Australia. Then, the Tokyo markets open at 7 pm NY Time. Next, Singapore\nand Hong Kong open at 9pm NY Time followed by the European markets in Frankfurt\n(2am) and then London (3am). By 4am the European markets are in full swing, and\nAsia has concluded their trading day. The U.S. markets open ﬁrst in New York around\n8am Monday as Europe winds down. By 5pm, Sydney is set to reopen once again.\nThe majority of trading activity happens when the markets overlap; for example,\nAsia and Europe trading overlaps between 12am to approximately 2am, Europe and\nthe United States overlaps between 8a m to approximately 12pm NY Time, while\nthe United States and Asia overlap be tween 5pm and 9pm. During New York and\nLondon hours, all currency pairs trade actively. During the Asian hours, however,\nthe trading activity for pairs such as the GBPJPY and AUDJPY tend to peak.\nLower Transaction Costs\nLower transaction costs also makes forex an attractive asset class to trade. In the\nequity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission and with online\nequity brokers, commissions can run upwards of $20 per trade. This means that for\npositions of $100,000, average roundtrip commissions could be as high as $120.\nThe over the counter (OTC) structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which, in turn, lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Equity traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade for\nshort-term traders. For an active equity trader who typically places 30 trades a day,\nat $20 commission per trade, you would have to up to pay $600 in daily transaction\ncosts. This is a signiﬁcant amount of money that could take a large cut out of proﬁts\nor deepen losses. The reason why costs are so high is because there are a lot of\npeople involved in an equity transaction. More speciﬁcally, for each trade, there is\na broker, the exchange, and the specialist. All of these parties need to be paid, and\ntheir payment comes in the form of commission and clearing fees. In the FX market,\nbecause it is decentralized with no exchange or clearinghouse (everything is taken\ncare of by the market maker), these fees are not applicable.\nCustomizable Leverage\nEven though many people realize that higher leverage comes with risks, traders are\nhumans, and few of them ﬁnd it easy to turn away the opportunity to trade on\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET7someone else’s money. The FX market caters perfectly to these traders by offering\nthe highest leverage available for any market. Most online currency ﬁrms offer 50\ntimes leverage on regular-sized accounts and up to 200 times leverage on miniature\naccounts (abroad leverage can be as high as 400 times). Compare that to the 2 times\nleverage offered to the average equity investor and the 10 times capital that is\ntypically offered to the professional trader, and you can see why many traders have\nturned to the foreign exchange market. The margin deposit for leverage in the FX\nmarket is not seen as a down payment on a purchase of equity, as many perceive\nmargins to be in the stock markets. Rather, the margin is a performance bond, or\ngood-faith deposit, to ensure against trading losses. This is very useful to short-term\nday traders who need the enhancement in capital to generate quick returns. For the\nmore risk-averse investor, leverage is completely customizable, which means that\nif they only feel comfortable with 10 or 20 times leverage or no leverage at all,\nthey can elect to do so. It is extremely important to understand that leverage is a\ndouble-edged sword—it can magnify proﬁts but also losses.\nProﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nIn the FX market, proﬁt potentials exist in both bull and bear markets. Since\ncurrency trading always involves buying one currency and selling another, there\nis no structural bias to the market. Therefore, if you are long one currency, you\nare at the same time short another. As a result, equal proﬁt potential exists in\nboth upward-trending and downward-trending markets. This is different from the\nequities market, where most traders go long instead of short stocks, so the general\nequity investment community tends to suffer in a bear market.\nNo Trading Curbs or Uptick Rule\nThe FX market is the largest market in the world, forcing market makers to offer\nvery competitive prices. Unlike the equities market, there is never a time in the\nFX markets when trading curbs would take into effect and trading would be halted,\nonly to gap when reopened. This eliminates missed proﬁts due to archaic exchange\nregulations. In the FX market, traders would be able to place trades 24 hours a day\nwith virtually no disruptions.\nOne of the biggest annoyances for day trades in the equity market is the fact\nthat traders are prohibited from shorting a stock in a downtrend unless there is an\nuptick. This can be very frustrating as traders wait to join short sellers, but are only\nleft with continually watching the stock trend down before an uptick occurs. In the\nFX market, there is no such rule. If you want to short a currency pair, you can do\nso immediately; this allows for instant and efﬁcient execution.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET8Online Trading Reducing Error Rates\nA shorter trade process minimizes errors. Online currency trading is typically a\nthree-step process. A trader would place an order on the platform, the FX dealing\ndesk would automatically execute it electronically, and the order conﬁrmation\nwould be posted or logged onto the trader’s trading station. Typically, these three\nsteps would be completed in a matter of seconds. For an equities trade on the other\nhand, there is generally a ﬁve-step process. The client would call his broker to place\nan order, the broker sends the order to the exchange ﬂoor, the specialist on the\nﬂoor tries to match up orders (the broker competes with other brokers to get the\nbest ﬁll for the client), the specialist executes the trade, and the client receives a\nconﬁrmation from the broker. The elimination of a middleman minimizes the error\nrates in currency trades and increases the efﬁciency of each transaction.\nLimited Slippage\nUnlike the equity markets, many online FX market makers provide instantaneous\nexecution from real-time, two-way quotes. These quotes are the prices where the\nﬁrms are willing to buy or sell the quoted currency, rather than vague indications\nof where the market is trading, which may or may not be honored. Orders are\nexecuted and conﬁrmed within seconds. Robust systems would never request the\nsize of a trader’s potential order, or which side of the market he’s trading, before\ngiving him a bid/offer quote. Inefﬁcient dealers determine whether the investor is a\nbuyer or a seller, and shade the price to increase their own proﬁt on the transaction.\nThe equity market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’ system, under\nwhich you may not get executed at the price you wish, but rather at the next best\nprice available. For example, let’s say Microsoft is trading at $52.50. If you enter a\nbuy order at this rate, by the time it reaches the specialist on the exchange ﬂoor, the\nprice may have risen to $53.25. In this case, you will not get executed at $52.50;\nyou will get executed at $53.25, which is essentially a loss of 3∕4of a point. The\nprice transparency provided by the some of the better market makers assures that\ntraders always receive a fair price.\nPerfect Market for Technical Analysis\nFor technical analysts, currencies rarely spend much time in tight trading ranges and\nhave the tendency to develop strong trends. Over 80% of volume is speculative in\nnature and as a result, the market frequently overshoots and then corrects itself.\nHence, technical analysis works well for the FX market, and a technically trained\ntrader can easily identify new trends and breakouts, which provide multiple oppor-\ntunities to enter and exit positions. Charts and indicators are used by all professional\nFX market traders, and candle charts are available on most charting packages. In addi-\ntion, the most commonly used indicators such as Fibonacci retracements, stochastics,\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET9MACD, moving averages, RSI, and support/resistance levels have proven valid in\nmany instances.\nIn the USDJPY chart shown in Figure 1.1, it is clear that Fibonacci retracements,\nmoving averages, and stochastics have at one point or another given successful\ntrading signals. For example, the 61.8% retracement level served as resistance for\nUSDJPY in December 2014, January 2015, and February 2015. The moving-average\ncrossovers of the 10- and 20-day simple moving averages also successfully forecasted\nthe rally in USDJPY in late October, along with the decline in early January. Equity\ntraders who focus on technical analysis have the easiest transition, since they can\nimplement the same technical strategies that they use in the equities market into the\nFX market.\nAnalyze Stocks Like Countries\nTrading currencies is not a big challenge for fundamental traders either, because\ncountries can be analyzed like stocks. For example, if you analyze growth rates of\nstocks, you can use gross domestic product (GDP) to analyze the growth rate of\ncountries. If you analyze inventory and production ratios, you can follow industrial\nproduction (IP) or durable goods data. If you follow sales ﬁgures, you can analyze\nretail sales data. As with a stock investme n t ,i ti sb e t t e rt oi n v e s ti nt h ec u r r e n c yo fa\ncountry that is growing faster and fund it with a currency of a country that is growing\nslower. Currency prices reﬂect the balance of supply and demand for currencies.\nTwo of the primary factors affecting supply and demand of currencies are interest\nrates and the overall strength of the economy. Economic indicators such as GDP,\nforeign investment, and the trade balance reﬂect the general health of an economy\nand are therefore responsible for the underlying shifts in supply and demand for\nthat currency. There is a tremendous amount of data released at regular intervals,\nsome of which are more important than others. Data related to interest rates and\ninternational trade is the most closely followed.\nIf there is uncertainty regarding the direction of interest rates, any bit of news\non monetary policy can directly affect how the currency trades. Traditionally,\nif a country raises its interest rate, the currency of that country will strengthen\nin relation to other countries as investors shift assets to that country to gain a\nhigher return. In contrast, an interest rates hike is generally bad news for stocks\nbecause it means that borrowing costs have risen. In response, some investors will\ntransfer money out of a country’s stock market when interest rates are increased,\ncausing the country’s currency to weaken. Determining which effect dominates can\nbe tricky, but generally there is an advance consensus on how interest rates will\nmove. Indicators that have the biggest impact on interest rates are producer prices,\nconsumer prices, employment, spending, and GDP. Most of the time monetary\npolicy announcements are known in advance with meeting dates by the Bank of\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET10\nFIGURE 1.1 USDJPY Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET11England (BoE), the Federal Reserve (FED), European Central Bank (ECB), Bank\nof Japan (BoJ), and other central banks posted on their respective websites.\nAnother piece of data that can impact how currencies move is the trade balance,\nwhich shows the net differ ence over a period of time b etween a nation’s exports and\nimports. When a country imports more than it exports, the trade balance will show\na deﬁcit, which is generally considered unfavorable. For example, if U.S. dollars are\nsold for other domestic national currencies (to pay for imports), the ﬂow of dollars\noutside the country will depreciate the value of the dollar. Similarly, if trade ﬁgures\nshow an increase in exports, dollars will ﬂow into the United States and appreciate\nthe value of the dollar. From the standpoint of a national economy, a deﬁcit in and of\nitself is not necessarily a bad thing. If the deﬁcit is greater than market expectations\nhowever, it can trigger a negative price movement.\n■FX versus Futures\nTrading spot forex is also different from trading futures, and like equity traders,\nmany futures traders have also added currency spot trading into their portfolios. We\nknow that the spot forex market has the following attributes:\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nCharacteristics of Futures Markets\n1. There is limited market liquidity depending on the month of contract trades.\n2. The presence of exchange fees results in more costs and commissions.\n3. Market hours for futures trading are much shorter than spot and are dependent\non the product traded; each product may have different open and closing hours,\nand there is limited after-hours trading.\n4. Futures leverage is higher than equities, but still only a fraction of the leverage\noffered in FX.\n5. There tends to be prolonged bear markets.\n6. Pit trading structure increases error and slippage.\nLike in the equities market, traders can implement the same strategies they use\nin analyzing the futures markets in the FX m arket. Most future tr aders are technical\ntraders, and the FX market is perfect for technical analysis. In fact, it is the most\npopular analysis technique used by professional FX traders. Taking a closer look at\nhow the futures market stacks up, we see the following.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET12Comparing Market Hours and Liquidity\nThe volume traded in the FX market is estimated to be over ﬁve times that of the\nfutures market. The FX market is open for trading 24 hours a day, but the futures\nmarket has confusing market hours which vary based on the product traded. For\nexample, if you traded gold futures, it is only open for trading between 7:20am\nand 1:30pm on the COMEX. If you traded crude oil futures on the New York\nMercantile Exchange, t rading would only be ope n between 8:30am. and 2:10pm.\nThese varying hours not only create confusion but also makes it difﬁcult to act on\nbreakthrough announcements throughout the reminder of the day.\nIn addition, if you have a day job and can only trade after hours, futures would be\na very inconvenient market product to trade. You would basically be placing orders\nbased on past prices that are not current market prices. This lack of transparency\nmakes trading very cumbersome. In addition, each time zone has its own unique\nnews and developments that could move speciﬁc currency pairs, and with futures it\ncan difﬁcult to act on breaking overnight news.\nLow to Zero Transaction Costs\nIn the equity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission. With future\nbrokers, average commissions can run close to $160 per trade on positions of\n$100,000 or greater. The OTC structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which can in turn lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight,\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Futures traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow to zero transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade\nfor short-term traders. If you are an active futures trader who typically places 20\ntrades a day, at $100 commission per trade, you would have to pay $2,000 in daily\ntransaction costs. A typical futures trade involves a broker, a future commissions\nmerchant (FCM) order desk, a clerk on the exchange ﬂoor, a runner, and a pit\ntrader. All of these parties need to be paid, and their payment comes in the form of\ncommission and clearing fees, whereas the electronic nature of the market minimizes\nthese costs.\nNo Limit Up or Down Rules/Proﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nUnlike the tight restriction on the futures market, there is no limit down or limit\nup rule in the FX market. For example, on the S&P index futures, if the contract\nvalue falls more than 5% from the previous day’s close, limit down rules will come\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET13in effect, whereby on a 5% move, the index would only be allowed to trade at\nor above this level for the next 10 minutes. For a 20% decline, trading would be\ncompletely halted. Due to the decentralized nature of the FX market, there are no\nexchange-enforced restrictions on daily activity, which can help eliminate missed\nopportunities caused by archaic exchange regulations.\nExecution Quality and Speed/Low Error Rates\nThe futures market is also known for inconsistent execution, both in terms of pricing\nand execution time. Every futures trader has, at some point in time, experienced\na half hour or so wait for a market order to be ﬁlled, only to ﬁnd that the order\nhas been executed at a price far away from where the market was trading when\nthe initial order was placed. Even with electronic trading and limited guarantees of\nexecution speed, the price for ﬁlls on market orders is far from certain. The reason\nfor this inefﬁciency is the number of steps that are involved in placing a futures\ntrade. A futures trade is typically a seven-step process:\n1. The client calls his broker and places his trade (or places it online).\n2. The trading desk receives the order, processes it, and routes it to the FCM\norder desk on the exchange ﬂoor.\n3. The FCM order desk passes the order to the order clerk.\n4. The order clerk hands the order to a runner or signals it to the pit.\n5. The trading clerk goes to the pit to execute the trade.\n6. The trade conﬁrmation goes to the runner or is signaled to the order clerk and\nprocessed by the FCM order desk.\n7. The broker receives the trade conﬁrmation and passes it on to the client.\nAn FX trade in comparison is typically only a three-step process. A trader would\nplace an order on the platform, the FX dealing desk would automatically execute\nit electronically, and the order conﬁrmation would be posted or logged on the\ntrader’s trading station. The elimination of the involvement of these additional\nparties increases the speed of the trade execution and decreases errors.\nIn addition, the futures market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’\nsystem, under which your trades frequently do not get executed at the initial market\norder price, but rather, at the next best price available. For example, let’s say a\nclient is long 5 March Dow Jones futures contracts at 8800. If the client enters a\nstop order at 8700, when the rate reaches this level, the client will most likely be\nexecuted at 8690. This 10-point difference would be attributed to slippage, which\nis very common in the futures market.\nOn most FX trading stations, traders execute directly off of real-time streaming\nprices. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, there is generally no discrepancy\nbetween the displayed price and the execution price. This holds true even during\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET14volatile times and fast-moving markets. In the futures market, execution is uncertain\nbecause all orders must be done on the exchange. This creates a situation where\nliquidity is limited by the number of participants, which, in turn, limits quantities\nthat can be traded at a given price. Real-time streaming prices ensure that market\norders, stops, and limits are executed with minimal slippage and no partial ﬁlls.\n■W h oA r et h eP l a y e r si nt h eF XM a r k e t ?\nSince the foreign exchange market is an OTC market without a centralized exchange,\ncompetition between market makers prohibits monopolisti c pricing strategies. If\none market maker attempts to drastically skew the price, then traders simply have\nthe option to ﬁnd another market maker. Moreover, spreads are closely watched to\nensure market makers are not whimsically altering the cost of the trade. Many equity\nmarkets, on the other hand, operate in a completely different fashion; the New York\nStock Exchange, for instance, is the sole place where companies listed on the NYSE\ncan have their stocks traded. Centralized markets are operated by what are referred\nto as specialists. Market makers, on the other hand, is the term used in reference to\ndecentralized marketplaces. Since the NYSE is a centralized market, a stock traded\non the NYSE can only have one bid–ask quote at all times. Decentralized markets,\nsuch as foreign exchange, can have multiple market makers—all of whom have the\nright to quote different prices. Here is an illustration of how both centralized and\ndecentralized markets operate.\nCentralized Markets\nBy their very nature, centralized markets tend to be monopolistic: With a single\nspecialist controlling th e market, prices can easil y be skewed to a ccommodate the\ninterests of the specialist, not those of the traders (see Figure 1.2). If, for example,\nthe market is ﬁlled with sellers that the specialists must buy from but no prospective\nbuyers on the other side, the specialist may simply widen the spread, thereby\nBuyers\nCan buy only\nfrom one\nspecialistSpecialist\nUnites buyers and\nsellers; maintains\nsole control over\nthe spreadSellers\nCan sell only to\none specialist\nFIGURE 1.2 Centralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET15increasing the cost of the trade and preventing additional participants from entering\nthe market. Or, specialists can drastically alter the quotes they are offering, thus\nmanipulating the price to accommodate their own risk tolerance.\nHierarchy of Participants\nWhile the foreign exchange market is decentralized, and hence employs multiple\nmarket makers rather than a single specialist, participants in the FX market are\norganized into a hierarchy; those with superior credit access, volume transacted,\nand sophistication receive priority pricing in the market (see Figure 1.3). At the\ntop of the food chain is the interbank market, which trades the highest volume per\nday in relatively few currencies. In the interbank market, the largest banks can deal\nwith each other directly, via interbank brokers, or through electronic brokering\nsystems like EBS or Reuters. The interbank market is a credit-approved system,\nwhere banks trade based solely on the credit relationships they have established\nwith one another. The banks can see the rates everyone is dealing at, but each bank\nmust have a speciﬁc credit relationship with that bank in order to trade at the rates\nbeing offered. Other institutions such as online FX market makers, hedge funds,\nand corporations must trade FX through these banks, although some have created\ntheir own liquidity pools through the years. Many banks (e.g., small community\nbanks or banks in emerging markets), corporations, and institutional investors do\nnot have access to these rates because they have no established credit lines with\nbig banks. This forces smaller participants to deal through just one bank for their\nRetail Clients\nTrader\nTrader\nTrader\nTraderOnline TradingInterbank Market\nBank Bank\nBank BankEBS and\nReutersOnline FX\nMarket\nMakers\nFIGURE 1.3 Decentralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET16foreign exchange needs, and oftentimes this means much less competitive rates for\nthe participants further down the participant hierarchy. Those receiving the least\ncompetitive rates are customers of banks and physical currency exchange companies.\nRecently, technology has broken down the barriers that used to stand between the\nend-users of foreign exchange services and the interbank market. The online trading\nrevolution opened its doors to retail clientele by connecting market makers and\nmarket participants in an efﬁcient, low-cost manner. In essence, online trading\nplatforms serve as a gateway to the liquid FX market. Average traders can now\ntrade alongside the biggest banks in the world, with virtually similar pricing and\nexecution. What used to be a game dominated and controlled by the ‘‘big boys’’ is\nslowly becoming a level playing ﬁeld where individuals can proﬁt and take advantage\nof the same opportunities as big banks. FX is no longer an old boys club, which\nmeans opportunities abound for aspiring online currency traders.\nDealing Stations— Interbank Market\nFor serious traders who want to know more about the interbank market, the\nmajority of FX volume is actually transacted primarily through the interbank\nmarket. The leading banks of the world trade with each other electronically\nover two platforms—the EBS and Reuters, dealing 3000-spot matching. Both\nplatforms offer trading in the major currency pairs; however, certain currency\npairs are more liquid and generally more frequently traded over one versus the\nother. Some cross-currency pairs are traded over these platforms as well, but\nothers are calculated from the rates of the major currency pairs and are then offset\nusing the ‘‘legs.’’ For example, if an interbank trader had a client who wanted to\ngo long NZDCAD, the trader would most likely buy NZDUSD and USDCAD\nseparately. The trader would then multiply these rates and provide the client with\nthe respective NZDCAD rate, creating a synthetic quote and trade.\n17CHAPTER 2\nHistorical Events in\nthe FX Markets\nBefore learning how to trade currencies, it is important for every new and\nseasoned market participant to have some understanding about the most\nimportant historical events that have shaped the currency market. To this day, these\nevents are often referenced by professional traders.\n■Bretton Woods: Anointing the Dollar as the World\nCurrency (1944)\nIn July 1944, representatives of 44 nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire,\nto create a new institutional arrangement for governing the international economy\nin the years following World War II. Most agreed that international economic\ninstability was one of the principle causes of the war, and that such instability needed\nto be prevented in the future. The agreement, which was developed by renowned\neconomists John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White, was initially proposed\nto Great Britain as a part of the Lend Lease Act—an American act designed to assist\nGreat Britain in postwar redevelopment efforts. After various negotiations, the ﬁnal\nform of the Bretton Woods Agreement consisted of three key items:\n1. The formation of key international authorities designed to promote fair trade\nand international economic harmony\n2. The ﬁxation of exchange rates between currencies\n3. The convertibility between gold and t he U.S. dollar, thus empowering the U.S.\ndollar as the reserve currency of choice for the world\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS18Of these three parameters, only the ﬁrst is still in existence today, but the\norganizations formed as a direct result of Bretton Woods include the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT); and they all play a crucial role in modern day development and regulation\nof international economies. Since the demise of Bretton Woods, the IMF has\nworked closely with the World Bank. Toge ther, the two institutions now regularly\nlend funds to developing nations, assisting them in the development of a public\ninfrastructure capable of supporting a sound mercantile economy that can contribute\nin the international arena. In order to ensure that these nations can actually enjoy\nequal and legitimate access to trade with their industrialized counterparts, the World\nBank and IMF must work closely with GATT. While GATT was initially meant to\nbe a temporary organization, it now operates to encourage the dismantling of trade\nbarriers—namely, tariffs and quotas.\nThe Bretton Woods Agreement existed from 1944 to 1971, after which it\nwas replaced by the Smithsonian Agreement, an international contract pioneered\nby U.S. President Richard Nixon out the necessity to accommodate for Bretton\nWoods’ shortcomings. Unfortunately, the Smithsonian Agreement possessed the\nsame critical weakness: While it did not include gold/U.S. dollar convertibility,\nit maintained ﬁxed exchange rates—a facet that did not accommodate the United\nStates’ ongoing trade deﬁcit and the international need for a weaker U.S. dollar. As\na result, the Smithsonian Agreement was short-lived.\nUltimately, the exchange rates of t he world evolved into a free market,\nwhere supply and demand were the sole criteria that determined the value of a\ncurrency. While this did and still does result in a number of currency crises and\ngreater volatility between currencies, it also allowed the market to become self-\nregulating, and thus could dictate the appropriate value of a currency without any\nhindrances.\nAs for Bretton Woods, perhaps its most memorable contribution to the interna-\ntional economic arena was its role in changing the international perception about the\nU.S. dollar. While the euro is a revolutionary currency blazing new frontiers in both\nsocial behavior and international trade, the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve\ncurrency of choice. This is due, in large part, to the Bretton Woods Agreement:\nBy establishing dollar/gold convertibility, the dollar’s role as the world’s most\naccessible and reliable currency was ﬁrmly cemented. So while Bretton Woods\nmight be a doctrine of yesteryear, its impact on the U.S. dollar and international\neconomics still resonates today.\n■The End of Bretton Woods: Free Market\nCapitalism Is Born (1971)\nOn August 15, 1971, it became ofﬁcial: The Bretton-Woods system was abandoned\nonce and for all. While it had been exorcised before—only to subsequently emerge\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS19in a new form—this ﬁnal eradication of the Bretton Woods system was truly its\nlast stand: No longer would currencies be ﬁxed in value to gold, allowed only to\nﬂuctuate in a 1% range, but instead, their fair valuation could be determined by\nfree-market behavior such as trade ﬂows and foreign direct investment.\nAlthough U.S. President Nixon was conﬁdent that the end of the Bretton Woods\nsystem would bring about better times for the international economy, he was\nnot a believer that the free market could dictate a currency’s true valuation in a\nfair and catastrophe-free manner. Nixon and many well-respected economists at\nthe time reasoned that an entirely unstructured foreign exchange market would\nresult in competing devaluations, which, in turn, would lead to the breakdown of\ninternational trade and investment. The end result, Nixon and his board of economic\nadvisors argued, would be global depression.\nIn response, the Smithsonian Agreement was introduced a few months later.\nHailed by President Nixon as the ‘‘greatest monetary agreement in the history of\nthe world,’’ the Smithsonian Agreement strived to maintain ﬁxed exchange rates\nwithout the backing of gold. Its key difference from the Bretton Woods system was\nthat the value of the dollar could ﬂoat in a range of 2.25%, compared to just 1%\nunder Bretton Woods.\nUltimately, the Smithsonian Agreement proved to be unfeasible as well. Without\nexchange rates ﬁxed to gold, the free market gold price shot up to $215 per\nounce. Moreover, the U.S. trade deﬁcit continued to grow, and from a fundamental\nstandpoint, the U.S. dollar needed to be devalued beyond the 2.25% parameters\nestablished by the Smithsonian Agreement. In light of these problems, the foreign\nexchange markets were forced to close in February 1972.\nThe markets reopened in March 1973, and this time, they were not bound by a\nSmithsonian Agreement: The value of the US dollar was to be determined entirely\nby the market, as its value was not ﬁxed to any commodity, nor was its exchange rate\nﬂuctuation conﬁned to certain parameters. While this did provide the U.S. dollar,\nand other currencies by default, the agility required to adapt to a new and rapidly\nevolving international trading environment, it also set the stage for unprecedented\ninﬂation. The end of Bretton Woods and the Smithsonian Agreement, as well as\nconﬂicts in the Middle East, resulted in substantially higher oil prices and helped\nto create stagﬂation—the synthesis of unemployment and inﬂation—in the U.S.\neconomy. It would not be until later in the decade, when Federal Reserve Chairman\nPaul Volcker initiated new economic policies and President Reagan introduced a new\nﬁscal agenda, that the U.S. dollar would return to ‘‘normal’’ valuations. By then,\nthe foreign exchange markets had thoroughly developed and were capable of serving\na multitude of purposes. In addition to employing a laissez-faire style of regulation\non international trade, they also were beginning to attract speculators seeking to\nparticipate in a market with unrivaled liquidity and continued growth. Ultimately,\nthe death of Bretton Woods in 1971 marked the beginning of a new economic era, one\nthat liberated international trading while also proliferating speculative opportunities.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS20■Plaza Accord—Devaluation\nof the U.S. Dollar (1985)\nAfter the demise of all the various exchange rate regulatory mechanisms that\ncharacterized the twentieth century—t hat is, the Gold Standard, the Bretton\nWoods Standard, and the Smithsonian Agreement—the currency market was left\nwith virtually no regulation other than the mythical ‘‘invisible hand’’ of free\nmarket capitalism, one that supposedly strived to create economic balance through\nsupply and demand. Unfortunately, due to a number of unforeseen economic\nevents—such as the OPEC oil crises, stagﬂation throughout the 1970s, and drastic\nchanges in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ﬁscal policy—supply and demand, in and\nof themselves, became insufﬁcient means by which the currency markets could be\nregulated. A system of sorts was needed, but not one that was inﬂexible: Fixation of\ncurrency values to a commodity, such as gold, proved to be too rigid for economic\ndevelopment, as was also the notion of ﬁxing maximum exchange rate ﬂuctuations.\nThe balance between structure and rigidity was one that had plagued the currency\nmarkets throughout the twentieth century, and while advancements had been made,\na deﬁnitive solution was still greatly needed.\nHence, in 1985, the respective ministers of ﬁnance and central bank governors\nof the world’s leading economies—France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom,\nand the United States—convened in New York City, with the hopes of arranging a\ndiplomatic agreement that would work to optimize the economic effectiveness of\nthe foreign exchange markets. Meeting at the Plaza Hotel, the international leaders\ncame to the following agreements regarding speciﬁc economies and the international\neconomy as a whole:\n■Across the world, inﬂation was at very low levels. Contrary to the stagﬂation of\nthe 1970s—where inﬂation was high and real economic growth was low—the\nglobal economy in 1985 had done a complete 180, as inﬂation was now low and\ngrowth was strong.\n■While low inﬂation, even when coupled with robust economic growth, still\nallowed for low interest rates—a caveat that developing countries particularly\nenjoyed—there was an imminent danger of protectionist policies such as tariffs\nentering the economy. The United States was experiencing a large and growing\ncurrent account deﬁcit, while Japan and Germany were facing large and growing\nsurpluses. An imbalance so fundamental in nature could create serious economic\ndisequilibrium, which, in turn, would result in a distortion of the foreign exchange\nmarkets, and thus, the international economy as a whole.\n■The results of current account imbalances, and the protectionist policies that\nensued, required action. Ultimately, it was believed that the rapid acceleration\nin the value of the U.S. dollar, which appreciated more than 80% against the\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS21currencies of its major trading partners, was the primary culprit. The rising\nvalue of the U.S. dollar created enormous trade deﬁcits, hurting many different\neconomies.\nAt the meeting in the Plaza Hotel, the Uni ted States persuad ed other attending\ncountries to coordinate a multilateral intervention, and on September 22, 1985,\nthe Plaza Accord was implemented. This agreement was designed to allow for\na controlled decline of the dollar and the appreciation of the main anti-dollar\ncurrencies. Each country agreed to changes to their economic policies and to\nintervene in currency markets as necessary to weaken the value of the dollar. The\nUnited States agreed to cut its budget deﬁcit and lower interest rates. France, the\nUnited Kingdom, Germany, and Japan agreed to raise interest rates. Germany also\nagreed to tax cuts, while Japan agreed to let the value of the yen ‘‘fully reﬂect\nthe underlying strength of the Japanese economy.’’ However, one major problem\nwas that not every country adhered to their pledges made under the Plaza Accord.\nThe United States, in particular, did not follow through with its initial promise to\ncut the budget deﬁcit. Japan was severely hurt by the sharp rise in the yen, as its\nexporters were unable to remain competitive overseas, and it is argued that this\neventually triggered a 10-year recession in Japan. The United S tates, on the other\nhand, enjoyed considerable growth and price stability as a result of the agreement.\nThe effects of the multilateral intervention were seen immediately, and within\nless than two years, the dollar fell 46% and 50% against the German deutschemark\nand the Japanese yen, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.1.

This gradually resolved\nthe current account deﬁcits for the time being, and also ensured that protectionist\npolicies were minimal and nonthreatening. But perhaps most importantly, the\nPlaza Accord cemented the role of the central banks in regulating exchange rate\nmovement—yes, the rates would not be ﬁxed, and hence would be determined\nprimarily by supply and demand; but ultimately, such an invisible hand is insufﬁcient,\nand it was the right and responsibility of the world’s central banks to intervene on\nbehalf of the international economy when necessary.\n■George Soros—The Man Who Broke the Bank\nof England\nWhen George Soros placed a $10 billion speculative bet on the UK pound and\nwon, he became universally known as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England.’’\nWhether you love him or hate him, Soros led the charge in one of the most\nfascinating events in currency trading history. Here are the details.\nThe UK Joins the Exchange Rate Mechanism\nIn 1979, a Franco-German initiative set up the European Monetary System (EMS) to\nstabilize exchange rates, reduce inﬂation, and prepare for monetary integration. The\nExchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), one of the EMS’s main components, gave each\nparticipatory currency a central exchange rate against a basket of currencies, the\nEuropean Currency Unit (ECU). Participants (initially France, Germany, Italy, the\nNetherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and Luxemburg) were then required to\nmaintain their exchange rates within a 2.25% ﬂuctuation band above or below each\nbilateral central rate. The ERM was an adjustable-peg system, and nine realignments\nwould occur between 1979 and 1987. Whil e the United Kingdom was not one of\nthe original members, it would eventually join in 1990 at a rate of DM2.95 to the\npound and with a ﬂuctuation band of +/–6%.\nUntil mid-1992, the ERM appeared to be a success, as a disciplinary effect\nhad reduced inﬂation throughout Europe under the leadership of the German\nBundesbank. The stability wouldn’t last, however, as international investors started\nworrying that the exchange rate values of several currencies within the ERM\nwere inappropriate. Following German reuniﬁcation in 1989 government spending\nsurged, forcing the Bundesbank to print more money. This led to high inﬂation\nand left the German central bank with little choice but to increase interest rates.\nHowever, the rate hike came with consequences as it placed upward pressure on\nthe German mark. This forced other central banks to raise their interest rates as\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS23well as to maintain their pegged currency exchange rates (a direct application of\nIrving Fischer’s interest parity theory). Realizing that the UK’s weak economy and\nhigh unemployment rate would not permit the British government to maintain this\npolicy for long, George Soros stepped into action.\nSoros Bets Against the Success of UK Involvement in the ERM\nThe quantum hedge fund manager essentially wanted to bet that the pound would\ndepreciate because the United Kingdom would either devalue the pound or leave the\nERM. Thanks to the progressive removal of capital controls during the EMS years,\ninternational investors at the time had more freedom than ever to take advantage\nof perceived disequilibria, so Soros established short positions in pounds and long\npositions in marks by borrowing pounds and investing in mark-denominated assets.\nHe also made great use of options and futures. In all, his positions accounted for\na gargantuan $10 billion. Soros was not the only one; many other investors soon\nfollowed suit. Everyone was selling pounds, placing tremendous downward pressure\non the currency.\nAt ﬁrst, the Bank of England (BoE) tried to defend the pegged rates by buying\n15 billion pounds with its large reserve assets, but its sterilized interventions\n(whereby the monetary base is held constant thanks to open market interventions)\nwere limited in their effectiveness. The pound was trading dangerously close to the\nlower levels of its ﬁxed band. On September 16, 1992, a day that would later be\nknown as Black Wednesday, the bank announced a 2% rise in interest rates (from\n10% to 12%) in an attempt to boost the pound’s appeal. A few hours later, it\npromised to raise rates again to 15%, but international investors such as Soros could\nnot be swayed, knowing that huge proﬁts were right around the corner. Traders\nkept selling pounds in huge volumes, and the BoE kept buying them until, ﬁnally, at\n7:00 pm that same day, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced that Britain would\nleave the ERM and that rates would return to their initial level of 10%. The chaotic\nBlack Wednesday marked the beginning of a steep depreciation in the pound’s\neffective value.\nWhether the return to a ﬂoating currency was due to the Soros-led attack on\nthe pound or because of simple fundamental analysis is still debated today. What\nis certain, however, is that the pound’s depreciation of almost 15% against the\ndeutschemark and 25% against the dollar over the next ﬁve weeks as seen in Figure 2.2\nand Figure 2.3 resulted in tremendous proﬁts for Soros and others traders (the pound\nalso weakened by a similar proportion to the dollar). Within a month, the quantum\nfund cashed in on approximately $2 billion by selling the now more expensive\nDMs and buying back the now cheaper pounds. ‘‘The man who broke the Bank of\nEngland’’ showed how central banks can still be vulnerable to speculative attacks.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS243.00British Pound vs. Deutschemark (GBPDEM)\n2.90\n2.80\n2.70\n2.60\n2.50\n2.40\n2.30\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.2 GBPDEM after Soros\n2.10\n2.00\n1 .90\n1 .80\n1 .70\n1 .60\n1 .50\n1 .40British Pound Against US Dollar GBPUSD\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.3 GBPUSD after Soros\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS25■Asian Financial Crisis (1997–1998)\nFalling like a set of dominos on July 2, 1997, the relatively nascent Asian tiger\neconomies provide the perfect example of the interdependence in global capital\nmarkets and their subsequent effects throughout international currency forums.\nBased on several fundamental breakdowns, the cause of the ‘‘contagion’’ stemmed\nlargely from shrouded lending practices, inﬂated trade deﬁcits, and immature capital\nmarkets. Compiled, these factors contributed to a perfect storm that left major\nregional markets incapacitated and once-prized currencies devalued to signiﬁcantly\nlower levels. With adverse effects easily seen in the equities markets, currency\nmarket ﬂuctuations were negatively impacted in much the same manner during this\ntime period.\nThe Bubble\nLeading up to 1997, investors had become increasingly attracted to Asian investment\nprospects, focusing on real estate development and domestic equities. As a result,\nforeign investment capital ﬂowed into the region as economic growth rates climbed\non improved production in countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and\nKorea. Thailand, home of the baht, experienced a 6.5% growth rate in 1996, falling\nfrom 13% in 1988. Lending additional support for a stronger economy was the\nenactment of a ﬁxed currency peg to the U.S. dollar. With a ﬁxed valuation to\nthe greenback, countries like Thailand could ensure ﬁnancial stability in their own\nmarkets and a constant rate for export trading purposes with the world’s largest\neconomy. Ultimately, the region’s national currencies appreciated, as underlying\nfundamentals were justiﬁed and increased speculative positions of further climbs in\nprice mounted.\nBallooning Current Account Deﬁcits and Nonperforming Loans\nHowever, in early 1997, a shift in sentiment began to occur as international account\ndeﬁcits became increasingly difﬁcult for respective governments to handle and\nlending practices were revealed to be detrimental to the economic infrastructure. In\nparticular, economists were alerted to the fact that Thailand’s current account deﬁcit\nballooned in 1996 to $14.7 billion and had been climbing since 1992. Although\ncomparatively smaller than the U.S. deﬁcit, the gap represented 8% of the country’s\ngross domestic product. Shrouded lending practices also contributed heavily to\nthese breakdowns, as close personal relationships with high-ranking banking ofﬁcials\nwere well rewarded and surprisingly common throughout the region. In particular\nthis affected many of South Korea’s highly leveraged conglomerates as total\nnonperforming loan values skyrocketed to 7.5 percent of gross domestic product.\nAdditional evidence of these practices could be observed in ﬁnancial institutions\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS26throughout Japan. First announcing questionable and nonperforming loans of\n$136 billion in 1994, Japanese authorities admitted to an alarming $400 billion\ntotal a year later. Coupled with a then-crippled stock market, cooling real estate\nvalues, and dramatic slowdowns in the economy, investors saw opportunity in\na depreciating yen, subsequently adding selling pressure to neighbor currencies.\nWhen their own asset bubble collapsed, asset prices fell by $10 trillion, with\nthe fall in real estate prices accounting for nearly 65% of the total decline—the\nlosses were worth two years of national output. This fall in asset prices sparked\nthe banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early 1990s and then developed into a\nfull-blown, systemic crisis in 1997, following the failure of a number of high-proﬁle\nﬁnancial institutions. In response, Japanese monetary authorities issued rhetoric on\npotentially increasing benchmark interest rates in hopes of defending the domestic\ncurrency valuation. Unfortunately, these considerations never materialized and a\nshortfall ensued. Sparked mainly by an announcement of a managed ﬂoat of the Thai\nbaht, the slide snowballed as central bank reserves evaporated and currency price\nlevels became unsustainable in light of downside selling pressure.\nCurrency Crisis\nFollowing mass short speculation and attempted intervention, the aforementioned\nAsian economies were left ruined and momentarily incapacitated. The Thailand baht,\na once-prized possession, was devalued by as much as 48 percent, even slumping\ncloser to a 100% fall at the turn of the new year. The most adversely affected was\n01/01/97 02/01/97 03/01/97 04/01/97 05/01/97 06/01/97 07/01/97 08/01/97 09/01/97 10/01/97 11/01/97 12/01/97 01/01/98 02/01/98 03/01/98 04/01/9860\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0140001997–98 Asian Currency Fluctuations\n12000\n10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0Thailand Baht Indonesia Rupiah\nFIGURE 2.4 Asian Crisis Price Action\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS27150USDJPY During Asian Crisis\n145\n140\n135\n130\n125\n120\n115\n110\n105\n100\n5/3/19966/3/19967/3/19968/3/19969/3/199610/3/199611/3/199612/3/19961/3/19972/3/19973/3/19974/3/19975/3/19976/3/19977/3/19978/3/19979/3/199710/3/199711/3/199712/3/19971/3/19982/3/19983/3/19984/3/19985/3/19986/3/1998\nFIGURE 2.5 USDJPY Asian Crisis Price Action\nthe Indonesian rupiah.

Additionally, it\nshowed the inability of central banks to successfully intervene in currency valuations\nwith the absence of secure economic fundamentals and overwhelming market forces.\nToday, with the assistance of IMF reparation packages and the implementation of\nstricter requirements, Asia’s four little dragons are healthy once again. With inﬂa-\ntionary benchmarks and a revived exporting market, Southeast Asia is building back\nits once prominent stature among the world’s industrialized economic regions. With\nthe experience of evaporating currency reserves under their belt, the Asian tigers\nnow take active initiatives to ensure that there is large pot of reserves on hand in\ncase speculators attempt to attack their currencies once again.\n■Introduction of the Euro (1999)\nThe introduction of the euro was a monumental achievement, marking the largest\nmonetary changeover ever. The euro was ofﬁcially launched as an electronic trading\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS28currency on January 1, 1999. Euro notes and coins were put into circulation in 2002.\nThe 11 initial member states were: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy,\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, and Finland. As of 2015, there\nare 17 countries in the Eurozone. Each country ﬁxed its currency to a speciﬁc\nconversion rate against the euro, and a common monetary policy governed by the\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) was adopted. To many economists, the system would\nideally include all of the original 15 EU nations, but the United Kingdom, Sweden,\nand Denmark decided to keep their own currencies. In deciding whether to adopt\nthe euro, EU members have many important factors to consider.\nThe 1993 Maastricht Treaty sets out ﬁve main convergence criteria for member\nstates to participate in the European Monetary Union (EMU):\nMaastricht Treaty: C onvergence Criteria\n■The country’s government budget deﬁcit could not be greater than 3% of GDP.\n■The country’s government debt could not be larger than 60% of GDP.\n■The country’s exchange rate had to be maintained within ERM bands without any\nrealignment for two years prior to joining.\n■The country’s inﬂation rate could not be higher than 1.5% above the average\ninﬂation rate of the three EU countries with the lowest inﬂation rates.\n■The country’s long-term interest rate on government bonds could not be higher\nthan 2% above the average of the comparable rates in the three countries with the\nlowest inﬂation.\nAlthough the ease of traveling is one of the most attractive reasons to join the\neuro, being part of the monetary union provides other beneﬁts:\n■It eliminates exchange rate ﬂuctuations, providing a more stable environment to\ntrade within the euro area.\n■The purging of all exchange rate risk within the zone allows businesses to plan\ninvestment decisions with greater certainty.\n■Transaction costs also diminish, mainly those relating to foreign exchange\noperations, hedging operations, cross-border payments, and the management of\nseveral currency accounts.\n■Prices become more transparent as consumers and businesses can compare prices\nacross countries more easily, which, in turn, increases competition.\n■A huge single currency market becomes more attractive for foreign investors.\n■The economy’s magnitude and stability allow the ECB to control inﬂation with\nlower interest rates, thanks to increased credibility.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS\nk\nk29\nk\nk\nFIGURE 2.6 EURUSD Price Since Launch\nSource: eSignal\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS30Yet the euro is not without its limitations. Leaving aside political sovereignty\nissues, the main problem is that, by adopting the euro, a nation essentially forfeits\nany independent monetary policy. Since each country’s economy is not perfectly\ncorrelated to the EMU’s economy, a nation might ﬁnd the ECB hiking interest\nrates during a domestic recession. This can be particularly true for many of the\nsmaller nations. As a result, countries try to rely more heavily on ﬁscal policy, but\nthe efﬁciency of ﬁscal policy is limited when it is not effectively combined with\nmonetary policy. This inefﬁciency is further exacerbated by the 3% of GDP limit on\nbudget deﬁcits, as stipulated by the Stability and Growth Pact.\nSome concerns also subsist regarding the ECB’s effectiveness as a central bank.\nThe central bank strives for a 2% inﬂation target, but in the past 15 years, it strayed\naway from this level often. Also, from 1999 to late 2002, a lack of conﬁdence\nin the union’s currency (and in the union itself) led to a 24% depreciation, from\napproximately $1.15 to the euro in January 1999 to $0.88 in May 2000, forcing\nthe ECB to intervene in foreign exchange markets in the last few months of 2000.\nFigure 2.6 shows a daily chart of the euro since it was launched in 1999.\nSince 2000, things have greatly changed, with the euro trading at a premium to\nthe dollar, but quantitative easing in 2014 put the currency back in a downtrend\nversus the dollar. Some analysts claim that the euro will one day replace the dollar\nas the world’s dominant international currency, and while we believe it will have a\ngreater share in reserve portfolios, we doubt that this will be likely.\n31CHAPTER 3\nWhat Moves the\nCurrency Market?\nNow that we know a little bit about the history of the forex market, let’s take a\nlook at what moves currencies. There are two primary ways to analyze ﬁnancial\nmarkets: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis is rooted\nin understanding underlying economic conditions, while technical analysis uses\nhistorical prices to predict future movements. For as long as technical analysis\nhas been around, there has been an ongoing debate as to which methodology\nis more successful. Short-term traders prefer to use technical analysis, focusing\ntheir strategies primarily on price action, while medium-term traders tend to use\nfundamental analysis to determine a currency’s current and future valuation.\nBefore implementing successful trading strategies, it is important to understand\nwhat drives the movements of currencies in the foreign exchange market. The\nbest strategies tend to be the ones that combine both fundamental and technical\nanalysis. Textbook perfect technical formations have failed too often because of\nmajor fundamental news and events like U.S. nonfarm payrolls. But trading on\nfundamentals alone can also be risky. There will oftentimes be sharp gyrations in\nthe price of currency on a day when there are no news or economic reports. This\nsuggests that the price action is driven by nothing more than ﬂows, sentiment, and\npattern formations. Therefore, it is very important for technical traders to be aware\nof the key economic data or events that are scheduled for release, and, in turn,\nfor fundamental traders to be aware of important technical levels that the general\nmarket may be focusing on.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?32■Fundamental Analysis\nFundamental analysis focuses on the economic, social, and political forces that drive\nsupply and demand. Those using fundamental analysis as a trading tool look at\nvarious macroeconomic indicators such as growth rates, interest rates, inﬂation,\nand unemployment. We outlined some of the most important economic releases\nin the ﬁrst chapter of this book. Fundamental analysts will combine all of this\ninformation to assess current and future performance. This requires a lot of work\nand thorough analysis, as there is no single set of beliefs that guides fundamental\nanalysis. Traders employing fundamental analysis need to continually keep abreast\nof news and announcements, as they can indicate potential changes to the economic,\nsocial, and political environment. All traders should be aware of the broad economic\nconditions before placing trades. This is especially important for day traders who\nare trying to make trading decisions based on news events because even though\nFederal Reserve Monetary Policy decisions are always important, if the rate move is\ncompletely priced into the market, then the actual reaction in the EURUSD could\nbe nominal.\nTaking a step back, currencies move primarily based on supply and demand.\nThat is, on the most fundamental level, a currency rallies because there is demand\nfor that currency. Regardless of whether the demand is for hedging, speculative,\nor conversion purposes, true movements are based on the need for the currency.\nCurrency values decrease when there is excess supply. Supply and demand should be\nthe real determinants for predicting future movements. However, how to predict\nsupply and demand is not as simple as many would think. There are many factors\nthat contribute to the net supply and demand for a currency. This includes capital\nﬂows, trade ﬂows, speculative, and hedging needs.\nFor example, the U.S. dollar was very strong (against the euro) between 1999\nand the end of 2001. This rally was driven primarily by the dot-com boom and the\ndesire by foreign investors to participate in these elevated returns. This demand\nfor U.S. assets required foreign investors to sell their local currencies and purchase\nU.S. dollars. Since the end of 2001, geopolitical uncertainty arose, the United States\nstarted cutting interest rates, and foreign investors started to sell U.S. assets in\nsearch of higher yields elsewhere. This required foreign investors to sell U.S. dollars,\nincreasing supply and lowering the dollar’s value against other major currency pairs.\nThe availability of funding or interest in buying a currency is a major factor that can\nimpact the direction that a currency trades. It was one of the primary drivers of the\nU.S. dollar between 2002 and 2005, making foreign ofﬁcial purchases of U.S. assets\n(also known as the Treasury International Capital Flow, or TIC data) an important\neconomic indicator.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?33Capital and Trade Flows\nCapital ﬂows and trade ﬂows constitute a country’s balance of payments, which\nquantiﬁes the amount of demand for a currency over a given period of time.\nTheoretically, a balance of payments equal to zero is required for a currency to\nmaintain its current valuation. A negative balance of payments number, on the other\nhand, indicates that capital is leaving the economy at a more rapid rate than it is\nentering, and hence, it should fall in value.\nThis is particularly important in current conditions (at the time of this book’s\npublication), where the United States is running a consistently large trade deﬁcit\nwithout sufﬁcient foreign inﬂow to fund that deﬁcit. As a result of this very problem,\nthe trade-weighted dollar index fell 22% in value between 2003 and 2005. The\nJapanese yen is another good example. As one of the world’s largest exporters, Japan\nruns a very high trade surplus. Therefore, despite a zero interest rate policy that\nprevents capital ﬂows from increasing, the yen has a natural tendency to trade lower\nbased on trade ﬂows, which is the other side of the equation. To be more speciﬁc,\nfollowing is a more detailed explanation of what capital and trade ﬂows encompass.\nCapital Flows\nCapital ﬂows measure the net amount of a currency that is being purchased or sold\ndue to capital investments. A positive capital ﬂow balance implies that foreign inﬂows\nof physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed outﬂows. A negative\ncapital ﬂow balance indicates that there are more physical or portfolio investments\nbought by domestic investors than foreign investors. There are generally two types\nof capital ﬂows—physical ﬂows and portfolio ﬂows (which are further segmented\ninto equity markets and ﬁxed-income markets).\nPhysical Flows\nPhysical ﬂows encompass actual foreign direct investments by corporations such as\ninvestments in real estate, manufacturing, and local acquisitions. All of these require\nthat a foreign corporation sell its local currency and buy the foreign currency, which\nleads to movements in the FX market. This is particularly important for global\nmergers and corporate acquisitions that involve more cash than stock.\nPhysical ﬂows are important to watch, as they represent the underlying changes\nin actual physical investment activity. These ﬂows shift in response to changes in\neach country’s ﬁnancial health and growth opportunities. Changes in local laws that\nencourage foreign investment also serve to promote physical ﬂows. For example,\ndue to China’s entry into the WTO, its foreign investment laws have been relaxed.\nAs a result of China’s cheap labor and attractive revenue opportunities (population\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?34of over 1 billion), corporations globally have ﬂooded China with investments. From\nan FX perspective, in order to fund investments in China, foreign corporations need\nto sell their local currency and buy Chinese renminbi (RMB).\nPortfolio Flows in Equity Markets\nAs technology has enabled greater ease with respect to transportation of capital,\ninvesting in global equity markets has become far more feasible. Accordingly, a\nrallying stock market in any part of the world serves as an ideal opportunity for all,\nregardless of geographic location. The result of this has become a strong correlation\nbetween a country’s equity markets and its currency: If the equity market is rising,\ninvestment dollars generally come in to seize the opportunity. Alternatively, falling\nequity markets could prompt domestic investors to sell their shares of local publicly\ntraded ﬁrms to take advantage of investment opportunities abroad.\nThe attraction of equity markets over ﬁxed-income markets has increased across\nthe years. Since the early 1990s, the ratio of foreign transactions in U.S. government\nbonds over U.S. equities has declined from 10 to 1 to 2 to 1. As indicated in\nFigure 3.1, it is evident that the Dow had a high correlation (of approximately 81%)\nwith the U.S. dollar (against the EUR) between 1994 and 1999. In addition, from\n1991–1999, the Dow increased 300%, while the USD index appreciated nearly 30%\nfor the same time period. As a result, currency traders closely followed the global\nequity markets to predict short and intermediate term equity-based capital ﬂows.\nHowever, this relationship shifted after the tech bubble burst in the United States as\n1/31/9412500 1. 15\n1. 10\n1 .05\n1 .00\n0.95\n0.90\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n0.70\n0.6511500\n10500\n9500\n8500\n7500\n6500\n5500\n4500\n3500\n6/30/94 11/30/94 4/28/95 9/29/95 2/29/96 7/31/96 12/31/96Dow Jones and USDEUR\n5/30/97 10/31/97 3/31/98 8/31/98 1/29/99 6/30/99 11/30/99INDU Index Px Last USDEUR Curncy\nFIGURE 3.1 Dow and USDEUR\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?35foreign investors remained relatively risk averse causing a lower correlation between\nthe performance of the U.S. equity market and the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, a\nrelationship still exists, making it important for all traders to keep an eye on global\nmarket performances in search of intermarket opportunities.\nPortfolio Flows in Fixed-Income Markets\nJust as the equity market is correlated to exchange rate movement, so too is the\nﬁxed-income market. In times of global uncertainty, ﬁxed-income investments can\nbecome particularly appealing, due to the inherent safety they possess. As a result,\neconomies boasting the most valuable ﬁxed-income opportunities will be capable of\nattracting foreign investment—which will naturally ﬁrst require the purchasing of\nthe country’s respective currency.\nA good gauge of ﬁxed-income capital ﬂows are the short- and long-term yields of\ninternational government bonds. It is important to monitor the spread differential\nbetween the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the yield on foreign bonds because\ninternational investors tend to move money from one country to another in search\nof the highest yielding assets. When U.S. assets have one of the highest yields,\nthis encourages more investments in U.S. ﬁnancial instruments, hence beneﬁting\nthe U.S. dollar. When the United States has the lowest yields, this discourages\ninvestments. Investors can also use short-term yields, such as the spreads on 2-year\ngovernment bonds, to gauge the short-term ﬂow of international funds. Aside from\ngovernment bond yields, Fed fund futures can also be used to estimate movement\nof U.S. funds, as they price in the expectation of future Fed interest rate policy.\nEuribor futures are a barometer for the Euro region’s expected future interest rates\nand can give an indication of EU future policy movements. We will discuss how to\nuse ﬁxed-income products to trade FX further in our strategy section.\nTrade Flows: Measuring Exports versus Imports\nTrade ﬂows are the basis of all international transactions. Just as the investment\nenvironment of a given economy is a key driver of its currency valuation, trade ﬂows\nrepresent a country’s net trade balance. Countries that are net exporters—meaning\nthey sell more goods abroad than they buy—will experience a net trade surplus.\nCountries that are net exporters are more likely to have their currency rise in value\nbecause from the perspective of international trade, their currency is being bought\nmore than it is sold. This impacts currency ﬂows because international clients buying\nthe exported product/service must ﬁrst buy the currency of the exporting nation.\nCountries who are net importers purchase more goods abroad than they sell,\ncreating a trade deﬁcit. These nations will generally see more downward than\nupward pressure on their currencies because in order to purchase these foreign\ngoods, importers must sell their own currency and purchase the currency of the\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?36country from which they are buying the good or service. This accordingly drives\ndown the value of the currency when all else is equal. This concept is important\nbecause it is one of primary reasons why many economists say that certain currencies\nneed to fall to reverse burgeoning trade deﬁcits.\nTo understand this further, let’s imagine that the UK economy is booming,\nand its stock market is performing well. Meanwhile, in the United States, a\nlackluster economy is creating a shortage of investment opportunities. In this type\nof environment U.S. investors will feel more inclined to sell their U.S. dollars and\nbuy British pounds to participate in the outperformance of the UK economy. When\nthey elect to do so, it results in the outﬂow of capital from the United States and\nthe inﬂow of capital into the United Kingdom. From an exchange rate perspective,\nthis would induce a fall in the USD coupled with a rise in the GBP, as demand for\nUSD declines and the demand for GBP increases, translating into strength for the\nGBP/USD currency pair.\nEven day and swing traders will ﬁnd it valuable to keep up with incoming\neconomic reports from the major economies.\nTrading Tip: Charting Economic Surprises\nOne way for traders to stay on top of economic trends is to chart economic data\nsurprises against price action. Figure 3.2 illustrates how this can be done. The chart\ngraphs how much an economic indicator has deviated from its consensus forecast,\nor the ‘‘surprise,’’ and stacks them on the same side and graphs price (blue line)\naction when the data was release against the surprise, with a simple regression line\n(white line). This can be done for all of the major currency pairs and provides a\nvisual guide to understanding whether price action has been in line with economic\nfundamentals and can be used as a guide to future price action. Economic data can\nbe found on the calendars of any major forex website, and price action can generally\nbe downloaded from your trading platforms.\nAccording to Figure 3.2, in November of 2004, there were 14 out of 15 positive\neconomic surprises and yet the dollar sold off against the euro during the month\nof December, which was the month in which the economic data were released.\nAlthough this methodology is not exact, the analysis is simple and past charts\nhave yielded some extremely useful clues to future price action. Figure 3.3 shows\nhow the EURUSD moved the following month. As you can see, the EURUSD\nquickly corrected itself during the month of January, indicating that the fundamental\ndivergence from price action that occurred in December proved to be quite useful\nto dollar longs, which harvested almost 600 pips as the euro quickly retracted a large\npart of its gains in January. This method of analysis, called variant perception, was ﬁrst\ninvented by the legendary hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, who produced\n24% average rates return for 30 consecutive years.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?37US Dollar Data and EURUSD\n1 .3700\n1 .3600\n1 .3500\n1 .3400\n1 .3300\n1 .3200\n1. 3 10 0\n1 .3000\n–100%–26.11%0.00%0.00%1.41%1.46%2.56%2.81%3.55%4.18%14.29%16.67%33.33%43.48%50.25%140.00%\n–50% 0% 50%Durable Goods\nEmpire State Manufacturing\nPhilly Fed\nLeading Economic Indicators\nPersonal Income\nIndustrial Production\nISM Non-Manufacturing\nCurrent Account\nExisting Home Sales\nGDP Annualized\nU.

Large positive and negative\nsurprises in economic data can often yield clues to future price action. If you go back\nand look at the EURUSD charts, you will see that the record current account deﬁcits\nin October 2004 were the catalyst that sent the dollar plunging over the next two\nmonths. In many ways, economic fundamentals matter more in the foreign exchange\nmarket than in any other market, and charts such as these could provide valuable\nclues to price direction. Generally, the 15 most important economic indices are\nchosen from each region, and then a price regression line is superimposed over the\npast 20 days of price data.\n■Technical Analysis\nPrior to the mid-1980s, fundamental traders dominated the FX market. However,\nwith the rising popularity of technical analysis and the advent of new technologies,\nthe inﬂuence of technical trading on the FX market has increased signiﬁcantly. The\navailability of high leverage also led to an increased number of high frequency and\nmomentum. They have become active participants in the FX market, with the acute\nability to inﬂuence currency prices.\nUnlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses on the study of price\nmovements. Technical analysts use historical currency data to forecast the direction\nof future prices. The underlying belief behind technical analysis is that all current\nmarket information is already reﬂected in the price of that currency; therefore,\nstudying price action is all that is required to make informed trading decisions. In a\nnutshell, technical analysis assumes that history will repeat itself.\nTechnical analysis is an extremely popular tool used by short- and medium-term\ntraders for analyzing the forex market. It works especially well in the currency\nmarkets because short-term currency price ﬂuctuations are primarily driven by\nhuman emotions or market perceptions. The primary tool in technical analysis\nis price and charts. Traders will look for trends and patterns to identify trading\nopportunities. The most basic concept of technical analysis is that markets have a\ntendency to trend. Being able to identify trends in their earliest stage of development\nis the key to technical analysis. Range trading is also very popular, and similar tools\ncan be used to identify these setups. Technical analysis integrates price action and\nmomentum to construct a pictorial representation of past currency price action and\nto use this information to predict future performance. Technical analysis tools such\nas Fibonacci retracement levels, moving averages, oscillators, candlestick charts, and\nBollinger bands provide further information on the value of the emotional extremes\nof buyers and sellers. It also helps to gauge when greed and fear are the strongest.\nThere are basically two types of markets, trending or range bound, and in the trade\nparameters section, we outline some rules that can help traders determine the type\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?39of market they trading in right now and the sort of trading opportunities they should\nbe looking for.\nIs Technical Analysis or Fundamental Analysis Better?\nNo one will ever win the age-long battle between technical and fundamental analysis.\nHowever, most individual traders will start trading with technical analysis because\nit is easier to understand and does not require hours of study. Technical analysts can\nalso follow many currencies and markets at one time, whereas fundamental analysts\ntend to focus on a few pairs due to the overwhelming amount of data in the market.\nNonetheless, technical analysis works well because the currency market tends to\ndevelop strong trends. Once technical analysis is mastered, it can be applied with\nequal ease to any time frame or currency traded.\nHowever, it is important to take both strategies into consideration, as fundamental\nanalysis can trigger technical movements such as breakouts or reversal in trends.\nTechnical analysis, on the other hand, can also explain moves that fundamentals\ncannot, especially in quiet markets, causing resistance in trends or unexplainable\nmovements. For example, as shown in Figure 3.4, in the days leading up to\nSeptember 11, USDJPY had just broken out of a triangle formation and looked\npoised to head higher. However, as the chart indicates, instead of breaking higher as\ntechnicians may have anticipated, USDJPY broke down following the September 11,\n2001, terrorist attacks and ended up hitting a low of 115.81 from a high of 121.88\non September 10.\n■Currency Forecasting—What Bookworms\nand Economists Look At\nFor more avid students of foreign exchange who want to learn more about\nfundamental analysis and valuing currencies, this section examines the different\nmodels of currency forecasting used by analysts of the major investment banks.\nThere are seven major models for forecasting currencies, which include the balance\nof payments theory, purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, the monetary\nmodel, the real interest rate differential model, the asset market model, and the\ncurrency substitution model.\nBalance of Payments Theory\nThe balance of payments theory states that exchange rates should be at their\nequilibrium level, which is the rate that produces a stable current account balance.\nCountries with trade deﬁcits experience a run on their foreign exchange reserves\ndue to the fact that exporters to that nation must sell that nation’s currency in order\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?k\nk40k\nk\nFIGURE 3.4 USDJPY September 11th Chart\nSource: eSignal\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?41to receive payment. The cheaper currency makes the nation’s exports less expensive\nabroad, which in turn fuels exports and brings the currency into balance.\nWhat Is the Balance of Payments (BOP)?\nThe balance of payments account is divided into two parts: the current account and\nthe capital account. The current account measures trade in tangible, visible items\nsuch as cars and manufactured goods; the trade balance is the surplus or deﬁcit\nbetween exports and imports. The capital account measures ﬂows of money, such\nas investments for stocks or bonds. Balance of payments data can be found on the\nwebsite of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nTrade Flows\nThe trade balance of a country shows the net difference over a period of time\nbetween a nation’s exports and imports. When a country imports more than it\nexports, the trade balance is negative or is in a deﬁcit. If the country exports more\nthan it imports, the trade balance is positive or is in a surplus. The trade balance\nreﬂects the redistribution of wealth among countries and is a major channel through\nwhich the macroeconomic policies of a country may affect another.\nIn general, if a country has a trade deﬁcit, it is considered to be unfavorable, since\nit negatively impacts the value of the nation’s currency. For example, if U.S. trade\nﬁgures show greater imports than exports, more dollars ﬂow out of the United\nStates and the value of the U.S. currency depreciates. A positive trade balance,\nin comparison, will affect the dollar by causing it to appreciate against the other\ncurrencies.\nCapital Flows\nIn addition to trade ﬂows, there are also capital ﬂows that occur among countries.\nThey record a nation’s incoming and outgoing investment ﬂows, such as payments\nfor entire or parts of companies, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, real estate, and\nfactories. Capital ﬂows are inﬂuenced by many factors, including the ﬁnancial and\neconomic climate of other countries, and can be in the form of physical or portfolio\ninvestments. In general, in developing countries, the composition of capital ﬂows\ntends to be skewed toward foreign direct investment (FDI) and bank loans. For\ndeveloped countries, due to the strength of the equity and ﬁxed-income markets,\nstocks and bonds appear to be more important than bank loans and FDI.\nEquity Markets\nEquity markets have a signiﬁcant impact on exchange rate movements because\nthey are a major place for high-volume currency movements. Their importance is\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?42considerable for the currencies of countries with developed capital markets, where\na great amount of capital inﬂows and outﬂows occur, and where foreign investors\nare major participants. The amount of the foreign investment ﬂows in the equity\nmarkets is dependent on the general health and growth of the market, reﬂecting\nthe well-being of companies and particular sectors. Movements of currencies occur\nwhen foreign investors move their money to a particular equity market. Thus,\nthey convert their capital in a domestic currency and push the demand for it\nhigher, making the currency appreciate. When the equity markets are experiencing\nrecessions, however, foreign investors tend to ﬂee, thus converting back to their\nhome currency and pushing the domestic currency down.\nFixed-Income (Bond) Markets\nThe effect that ﬁxed-income markets have on currencies is similar to that of the\nequity markets and is a result of capital movements. An investor’s interest in the\nﬁxed-income market depends on the company’s speciﬁcs and credit rating, as well as\non the general health of the economy and the country’s interest rates. The movement\nof foreign capital into and out of ﬁxed-income markets leads to change in the demand\nand supply for currencies, hence impacting the currencies’ exchange rates.\nSummary of Trade and Capital Flows\nDetermining and understanding a country’s balance of payments is perhaps the\nmost important and useful tool for those interested in fundamental analysis. Any\ninternational transaction gives rise to two offsetting entries: trade ﬂow balance\n(current account) and capital ﬂow balance (capital account). If the trade ﬂow balance\nis a negative outﬂow, the country is buying more from foreigners than it sells\n(imports exceed exports). When it is a positive inﬂow, the country is selling more\nthan it buys (exports exceed imports). The capital ﬂow balance is positive when\nforeign inﬂows of physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed that\ncountry’s outﬂows. A capital ﬂow is negative when a country buys more physical or\nportfolio investments than are sold to foreign investors.\nThese two entries, trade and capital ﬂow, when added together signify a country’s\nbalance of payments. In theory, the two entries should balance and add up to zero\nin order to provide for the maintenance of the status quo in a nation’s economy and\ncurrency rates.\nIn general, countries might experience positive or negative trade, as well as\npositive or negative capital ﬂow balances. In order to minimize the net effect of\nthe two on the exchange rates, a country should try to maintain a balance between\nthe two. For example, in the United States, there is a substantial trade deﬁcit, as\nmore is imported than is exported. When the trade balance is negative, the country\nis buying more from foreigners than it sells, and therefore it needs to ﬁnance its\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?43deﬁcit. This negative trade ﬂow might be offset by a positive capital ﬂow into the\ncountry, as foreigners buy either physical or portfolio investments. Therefore, the\nUnited States seeks to minimize its trade deﬁcit and maximize its capital inﬂows,\nwith hopes that the two will balance out.\nA change in this balance is extremely signiﬁcant and carries ramiﬁcations that\nrun deep into economic policy and currency exchange levels. The net result of the\ndifference between the trade and capital ﬂows, positive or negative, will impact the\ndirection in which the nation’s currency will move. If the overall trade and capital\nbalance is negative, it will result in a depreciation of the nation’s currency, and if\npositive, it will lead to an appreciation of the currency.\nClearly, a change in the balance of payments carries a direct effect for currency\nlevels. It is therefore possible for any investor to observe economic data relating to\nthis balance and interpret the results that will occur. Data relating to capital and\ntrade ﬂows should be followed most closely. For instance, if an analyst observes\nan increase in the U.S. trade deﬁcit and a decrease in the capital ﬂows, a balance\nof payments deﬁcit would occur, and as a result, an investor may anticipate a\ndepreciation of the dollar.\nLimitations of BOP Model\nThe BOP model mainly focuses on traded goods and services, while ignoring\ninternational capital ﬂows. Indeed, international capital ﬂows often dwarfed trade\nﬂows in the currency markets toward the end of the 1990s, and this oftentimes\nbalanced out the current account of debtor nations like the United States.\nFor example, in 1999, 2000, and 2001, the United States maintained a large\ncurrent account deﬁcit while the Japanese ran a large current account surplus.\nHowever, during this same period in time the U.S. dollar rose against the yen even\nthough trade ﬂows were running against the dollar. The reason was that capital ﬂows\nbalanced out trade ﬂows, thus defying the BOP’s forecasting model for a period of\ntime. Indeed, the increase in capital ﬂows has given rise to the asset market model .\nNote: It is probably a misnomer to call this theory the balance of payments theory\nsince it only takes into account the current account balance, not the actual balance\nof payments. However, until the 1990s capital ﬂows played a very small role in the\nworld economy, so the main statistic viewed was the trade balance, which made up\nthe bulk of the balance of payments for most nations.\nPurchasing Power Parity\nThepurchasing power parity (PPP) theory is based on the belief that foreign exchange\nrates should be determined by the relative prices of a similar basket of goods between\ntwo countries. Any change in a nation’s inﬂation rate should be balanced by an\nopposite change in that nation’s exchange rate. Therefore, according to this theory,\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?44when a country’s prices are rising due to inﬂation, that country’s exchange rate\nshould depreciate in order to return to parity.\nPPP’s Basket of Goods\nThe basket of goods and services priced for the PPP exercise is a sample of all goods\nand services covered by GDP. It includes consumer goods and services, government\nservices, equipment goods, and construction projects. More speciﬁcally, consumer\nitems include food, beverages, tobacco, clothing, footwear, rents, water supply,\ngas, electricity, medical goods and services, furniture and furnishings, household\nappliances, personal transport equipment, fuel, transport services, recreational\nequipment, recreational and cultural services, telephone services, education services,\ngoods and services for personal care and household operation, and repair and\nmaintenance services.\nBig Mac Index\nOne of the most well-known examples of PPP is The Economist ’s Big Mac Index. The\nBig Mac PPP calculates the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the\nsame in America as elsewhere. Comparing these with actual rates helps to signal if\na currency is under- or overvalued. As described by The Economist, the index is a\nlightheartedly guide to currency valuation. It was never intended as a precise gauge\nof currency misalignment, but merely a tool to make exchange-rate theory more\ndigestible.\nFor example, in January 2015, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and\nChinese yuan was approximately 6.20. At the time, a Big Mac cost $4.79 in the\nUnited States. In China, the same burger cost 17.15 yuan, or approximately $2.77\nat market exchange. This means that based on the comparison between the two\nburger prices, the Chinese yuan was undervalued by 42%.\nOECD Purchasing Power Parity Index\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) releases a\nmore formal index. Under a joint OECD-Eurostat PPP Program, the OECD and\nEurostat share the responsibility for calculating PPPs. Their latest information on\nwhich currencies are under- or overvalued against the U.S. dollar can be found\non the OECD website at www.oecd.org. The OECD publishes a table that shows\nthe price levels for the major industrialized countries. Each column shows the\nnumber of speciﬁed monetary units needed in each of the countries listed to buy\nthe same representative basket of consumer goods and services. In each case,\nthe representative basket costs a hundred units in the country whose currency is\nspeciﬁed. The chart that is then created compares the PPP of a currency with its\nactual exchange rate. The chart is updated weekly to reﬂect the current exchange\nrate. It is also updated about twice a year to reﬂect new estimates of PPP. The\nPPP estimates are taken from studies carried out by the OECD; however, it should\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?45not be taken as deﬁnitive. Different methods of calculation will arrive at different\nPPP rates.\nAccording to the OECD’s data as of April 17, 2015, the PPP value of the\nAustralian dollar versus the U.S. dollar based on GDP is 0.6712. At the time, the\nAUD/USD exchange rate was 0.7812. Using this model of valuation, this indicates\nthat the Australian dollar was 14% overvalued.\nLimitations to Using Purchasing Power Parity\nPPP theory should only be used for long-term fundamental analysis. While the\neconomic forces behind PPP will eventually equalize the purchasing power of\ncurrencies, this can take many years. A time horizon of 5–10 years is typical.\nPPP’s major weakness is that it assumes goods can be traded easily, without regard\nto such things as tariffs, quotas, or taxes. For example, when the U.S. government\nannounces new tariffs on imported steel, the cost of domestic manufactured goods\ngoes up; but those increases will not be reﬂected in the U.S. PPP tables.\nThere are other factors that must also be considered when weighing PPP: inﬂation,\ninterest rate differentials, economic releases/reports, asset markets, trade ﬂows,\nand political developments. Indeed, PPP is just one of several theories traders should\nuse when determining exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Parity\nThe interest rate parity theory states that if two different currencies have different\ninterest rates, then that difference should be reﬂected in the premium or discount\nfor the forward exchange rate to prevent riskless arbitrage.\nFor example, if U.S. interest rates are 3% and Japanese interest rates are 1%,\nthen the U.S. dollar should depreciate against the Japanese yen by 2% in order\nto prevent riskless arbitrage. This future exchange rate is reﬂected in the forward\nexchange rate stated today. In our example, the forward exchange rate of the dollar\nis said to be at discount because it buys fewer Japanese yen in the forward rate than\nit does in the spot rate. The yen is said to be at a premium.\nInterest rate parity has shown very little proof of effectiveness in recent years.\nOftentimes, currencies with higher interest rates rise and attract incoming invest-\nment, while currencies with low and falling interest rates decline as outﬂows slow.\nThe Monetary Model\nAccording to the monetary model, exchange rates are determined by a nation’s\nmonetary policy. The premise is that countries that follow a stable monetary policy\nover time should have appreciating currencies. Countries that have erratic monetary\npolicies or excessively expansionist policies should see the value of their currency\ndepreciate.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?46How to Use the Monetary Model\nThree factors inﬂuence exchange rates under this theory:\n1. A nation’s money supply\n2. Expected future levels of a nation’s money supply\n3. The growth rate of a nation’s money supply\nAll of these factors are key to understanding and spotting a monetary trend that\nmay force a change in exchange rates. For example, let’s assume that the Japanese\neconomy has been slipping in and out of recession for over a decade. Interest rates\nare near zero and annual budget deﬁcits prevent the Japanese from spending their\nway out of recession, which leaves only one tool left at the disposal of Japanese\nofﬁcials determined to revive Japan’s economy: printing more money. By buying\nstocks and bonds, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is increasing the nation’s money supply,\nwhich produces inﬂation, and this forces a change in the exchange rate. The example\nin Figure 3.5 illustrates the effect of money supply changes to the Japanese yen using\nthe monetary model.\nIndeed, it is in the area of excessive expansionary monetary policy that the\nmonetary model is most successful. One of the only ways a country can keep\nits currency from sharply devaluing is by pursuing a tight monetary policy. For\nexample, during the Asian Currency Crisis, the Hong Kong dollar came under\nattack from speculators. Hong Kong ofﬁcials raised interest rates to 300% to halt\nthe Hong Kong dollar from being dislodged from its peg to the U.S. dollar. The\ntactic worked perfectly, as speculators were cleared out by such sky-high interest\nrates. The downside was that the Hong Kong economy would slide into recession.\nBut in the end, the peg held and the monetary model worked.\nLimitations of the Monetary Model\nVery few economists rely solely on this model because it does not take into account\ntrade ﬂows and capital ﬂows. For example, throughout 2014 Australia had higher\ninterest rates, growth rates, and inﬂation rates than both the United States and the\nEuropean Union, yet, the AUD appreciated in value against both the dollar and the\neuro. Indeed, the monetary model has greatly struggled since the dawn of freely\nCHANGE IN MONEY\nSUPPL Y\nY en Is Printed Increase in Y en Creates\nInflationY en Depreciates in ValueCHANGE IN EXCHANGE\nRATECHANGE IN PRICE\nLEVEL\nFIGURE 3.5 Monetary Model\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?47ﬂoating currencies. The model holds that high interest rates signal growing inﬂation,\nwhich it often does, followed by a depreciating currency. But this does not take into\naccount the capital inﬂows that would take effect as a result of higher interest yields\nor of an equity market that may be thriving in a booming economy—thus causing\nthe currency to possibly appreciate.\nIn any case, the monetary model is one of several valuation tools that can be\nemployed in tandem with other models to determine the direction an exchange rate\nis heading.\nReal Interest Rate Differential Model\nAccording to the real interest rate differential theory, exchange rate movements are\ndetermined by a country’s interest rate. The idea is that countries with high interest\nrates should see their currency appreciate in value, while countries with low interest\nrates should see their currency depreciate in value.\nBasics of the Model\nThe basic premise of the model is that when a country raises its interest rates,\ninternational investors will buy that currency because they ﬁnd its yield more\nattractive. When a country lowers interest rates, they sell the currency. Figure 3.6\nUK\nUKInterest Rates vs. United States Eurozone\nEurozone2003 Percent.

The Australian dollar had the\nlargest basis point spread and also had the highest return against the U.S. dollar,\nwhich seems to vindicate the model, as investors bought up higher-yielding Aussie.\nThe same can be said for the New Zealand dollar, which also had a higher yield\nthan the U.S. dollar and gained 27% against USD. Yet the model becomes less\nconvincing when comparing the euro, which gained 20% against the dollar (more\nthan every currency except NZD), even though its basis point differential was\nonly 100 points. The model then comes under serious question when comparing\nthe British pound and the Japanese yen. The yen differential is –100, and yet it\nappreciated almost 12% against the dollar. Meanwhile, the British pound gained\nonly 11% against the dollar even though it had a whopping 275 point interest rate\ndifferential.\nThis model also stresses that one of the key factors in determining the severity of\nan exchange rate’s response to a shift in interest rates is the expected persistence of\nthat shift. Simply put, a rise in interest rates that is expected to last for ﬁve years\nwill have a much larger impact on the exchange rate than if that rise were expected\nto last for only one year.\nLimitations to the Interest Rate Model\nThere is a great deal of debate among international economists over whether there\nis a strong and statistically signiﬁcant link between changes in a nation’s interest rate\nand currency price. The main weakness of this model is that it does not take into\naccount a nation’s current account balance, relying on capital ﬂows instead. Indeed,\nthe model tends to overemphasize capital ﬂows at the expense of numerous other\nfactors, such as political stability, inﬂation, and poor economic growth. Absent these\ntypes of factors, the model can be very useful, since it is quite logical to conclude\nthat an investor will naturally gravitate toward the investment vehicle that pays a\nhigher reward.\nThe Asset Market Model\nThe basic premise of the asset market model theory is that the ﬂow of funds into the\nﬁnancial assets of a country such as equities and bonds increases the demand for that\ncountry’s currency (and vice versa). As proof, advocates point out that the amount\nof funds that are placed in investment products such as stocks and bonds now dwarf\nthe amount of funds that is exchanged as a result of the transactions in goods and\nservices for import and export purposes. The asset market theory is basically the\nopposite of the balance of payments theory since it takes into account a nation’s\ncapital account instead of its current account.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?49A Dollar-Driven Theory\nThroughout 1999, many experts argued that the dollar would fall against the euro\non the grounds of the expanding U.S. current account deﬁcit and an overvalued\nWall Street. That was based on the rationale that non-U.S. investors would begin\nwithdrawing their funds from U.S. stocks and bonds into more economically sound\nmarkets, which would weigh signiﬁcantly on the dollar. Yet, such fears have lingered\nsince the early 1980s when the U.S. current account soared to a record high 3.5%\nof GDP.\nIn the two decades that followed, the balance of payments approach in assessing\nthe dollar’s behavior has given way to the asset market approach. This theory\ncontinues to hold the most sway over pundits due to the enormity of U.S. capital\nmarkets. In May and June of 2002, the dollar plummeted over 1000 points versus\nthe yen at the same time equity investors ﬂed U.S. equity markets due to the\naccounting scandals that were plaguing Wall Street. As the scandals subsided toward\nthe end of 2002, the dollar rose 500 points from a low of 115.43 to close at 120.00\nagainst the yen, even though the current account balance remained in massive deﬁcit\nthe entire time.\nLimitations to the Asset Market Theory\nIt is frequently argued that over the long run, there is no relationship between\na nation’s equity market performance and the performance of its currency. See\nFigure 3.7 for a comparison. Between April 2014 and April 2015, the German DAX\nand EURUSD have a very weak correlation.\nAlso, what happens to a nation’s currency when the stock market is trading\nsideways—stuck between bullish and bearish sentiments? That was the scenario in\n6/11/14 7/11/14 8/11/14 9/11/1410/11/14 11/11/14 12/11/141/11/15 2/11/15 3/11/15 4/11/15 5/11/15 6/11/15EURUSD and DAX\n13000\n12500\n12000\n11500\n11000\n10500\n10000\n9500\n9000\n80001.4\n1.35\n1.3\n1.2\n11.051.11.151.25\n8500\nEURUSD BGN Curncy (R1) DAX  INDEX (R2)\nFIGURE 3.7 The DAX Index and the EURUSD\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?50Germany for much of 2014, and currency traders found themselves going back to\nolder money making models, such as interest rate arbitrage, as a result. Only time\nwill tell whether the asset market model will hold up or merely be a short-term blip\non the currency forecasting radar.\nThe Currency Substitution Model\nThe currency substitution model is an enhanced version of the monetary model\nbecause it takes into account investor ﬂows. It posits that the shifting of private\nand public portfolios from one nation to another can have a signiﬁcant effect on\nexchange rates. The ability of individuals to change their assets from domestic and\nforeign currencies is known as currency substitution. When this model is added\nto the monetary model, evidence shows that shifts in expectations of a nation’s\nmoney supply can have a decided impact on that nation’s exchange rates. Simply\nput, investors are looking at monetary model data and coming to the conclusion\nthat a change in money ﬂow is about to occur, thus affecting the exchange rate, so\nthey are investing accordingly, which turns the monetary model into a self-fulﬁlling\nprophecy. Investors who subscribe to this theory are merely jumping on the currency\nsubstitution model bandwagon on the way to the monetary model party.\nThe Yen Example\nIn the monetary model we talked about how the Japanese government was basically\nprinting yen and increasing the money supply when it bought stocks and bonds.\nMonetary model theorists would say that this monetary growth would spark inﬂation\n(more yen chasing fewer products), decrease demand for the yen, and ﬁnally cause\nthe yen to depreciate. A currency substitution theorist would agree with this scenario\nand look to take advantage of this view by shorting the yen, or if they were long\nthe yen promptly getting out of the position. By taking this action, our yen trader\nis helping to drive the market precisely in that direction, thus making the monetary\nmodel theory a fate accompli. The step-by-step process is illustrated in Figure 3.8.\nA. Japan announces new stock and bond buyback plan. Economists are now\npredicting Japan’s money supply will dramatically increase.\nB. Economists are also predicting a rise in inﬂation with the introduction of this\nnew policy. Speculators expect a change in the exchange rate as a result.\nC. Economists expect interest rates to rise and inﬂation takes hold in the economy.\nSpeculators start selling short the yen in anticipation of a change in the exchange\nrate.\nD. Demand for the yen plummets as money ﬂows easily through the Japanese\neconomy and speculators dump yen in the markets.\nE. The exchange rate for the Japanese yen changes dramatically as the yen falls\nin value to foreign currencies, especially those that are easily substituted by\ninvestors (read: liquid yen crosses).\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?51Forecast of\nFuture\nMonetary\nGrowth Forecast of\nFuture InflationChange in\nExchange RateChange in Real\nMoney Demand\nChange in\nExpected\nExchange RateChange in\nDemand for\nForeign Cash\nAB CD EForecast of\nFuture Inflation\nFIGURE 3.8 Currency Substitution Model\nLimitations of the Currency Substitution Model\nAmong the major, actively traded currencies, this model has not yet shown itself\nto be a convincing, single determinant for exchange rate movements. While this\ntheory can be used with more conﬁdence in underdeveloped countries where ‘‘hot\nmoney’’ rushes in and out of emerging markets with enormous effect, there are\nstill too many variables not accounted for by the currency substitution model. For\nexample, using the yen illustration in Figure 3.8, even though Japan may try to spark\ninﬂation with its securities’ buyback plan, it still has an enormous current account\nsurplus that will continually prop up the yen. Also, Japan has numerous political\nlandmines it must avoid in its own neighborhood, and should Japan make it clear\nthat it is trying to devalue its currency, there will be enormous repercussions. These\nare just two of many factors the substitution model does not take into consideration.\nHowever, this model (like numerous other currency models) should be considered\npart of an overall, balanced, FX forecasting diet."

Traditionally, it is the platform through which governments, businesses,\ninvestors, travelers, and other interested parties convert or ‘‘exchange’’ currency.\nAt its most fundamental level, the foreign exchange market is an over-the-counter\n(OTC) market with no central exchange and clearing house where orders are\nmatched. FX dealers and market makers around the world are linked to each other\naround-the-clock via telephone, computer, and fax, creating one cohesive market.\nThrough the years, this has changed with many institutions offering exchange traded\nFX instruments, but all of the prices are still derived from the underlying or spot\nforex market.\nIn the past two decades, foreign exchange, also known as forex orFX,became\navailable to trade by individual retail investors, and this access caused the market\nto explode in popularity. In the early 2000s, the Bank of International Settlements\nreported a 57% increase in volume between Ap ril 2001 and 2004. At the time more\nthan $1.9 trillion were changing hands on a daily basis. After the ﬁnancial crisis in\n2008, the pace of growth eased to a still- respectable 32% between 2010 and 2013,\nbut the actual volume that changed hands was signiﬁcantly larger at an average of\n$5.3 trillion per day. To put this into perspective, it is 50 times greater than the\ndaily trading volume of the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ combined.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET2While the growth of the retail foreign exchange market contributed to this surge\nin volume, an increase in volatility over the past few years also made investors\nmore aware of how currency movements can impact the equity and bond markets.\nIf stocks, bonds, and commodity traders want to make more educated trading\ndecisions, it is important for them to also follow forex movements. What follows\nare some of the examples of how currency ﬂuctuations impacted stock and bond\nmarket movements in past years.\n■EURUSD and Corporate Proﬁtability\nFor stock market traders, particularly those who invest in European corporations that\nexport a tremendous amount of goods to the United States, monitoring exchange\nrates are essential to predicting earnings and corporate proﬁtability. Throughout 2003\nand 2004, European manufacturers complained extensively about the rapid rise in the\neuro and the weakness in the U.S. dollar. The main culprit for the dollar’s selloff at\nthe time was the country’s rapidly growing trade and budget deﬁcits. This caused the\nEURUSD exchange rate to surge, which took a signiﬁcant toll on the proﬁtability of\nEuropean corporations because a higher exchange rate makes the goods of European\nexporters more expensive to U.S. consumers. In 2003, inadequate hedging shaved\napproximately EUR$1 billion euros from Volkswagen’s proﬁts, while DSM, a Dutch\nchemicals group, warned that a 1% move in the EURUSD rate would reduce proﬁts\nby EUR$7 million to EUR$11 million. Unfortunately, inadequate hedging is still a\nreality in Europe, which makes monitoring the EURUSD exchange rate even more\nimportant in forecasting the earnings and proﬁtability of European exporters.\n■Nikkei and U.S. Dollar\nTraders exposed to Japanese equities also need to be aware of the developments\nthat are occurring in the U.S. dollar and ho w that affects the Nikkei rally. Japan\nrecently came out of 10 years of stagnation. During this time, mutual funds and\nhedge funds were grossly underweight Japanese equities. When the economy began\nto turn around, global macro funds rushed to make changes to their portfolios in fear\nof missing out on a great opportunity to take advantage of Japan’s recovery. Hedge\nfunds borrowed signiﬁcant amount of dollars to pay for increased exposure, but the\nproblem was that their borrowings were very sensitive to U.S. interest rates and the\nFed’s monetary policy tightening cycle. Increased borrowing costs forthe dollar could\nderail the Nikkei’s rally because higher rates will raise the dollar’s ﬁnancing costs. Yet\nwith the huge current account deﬁcit, the Fed might need to continue raising rates\nto increase the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Therefore, continual\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET3rate hikes, coupled with slowing growth in Japan, may make it less proﬁtable for\nfunds to be overleveraged and overly exposed to Japanese stocks. As a result, how\nthe U.S. dollar moves also plays a role on the future direction of the Nikkei.\n■George Soros\nKnown as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England,’’ George Soros is one of\nthe most well-known traders in the FX market. We discuss his adventures in\nmore detail in Chapter 2, but in a nutshell, in 1990, England decided to join\nthe Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) system because it wanted to take part in\nthe stable and low-inﬂation environment created by the Bundesbank, the central\nbank of Germany. This alliance tied the pound to the deutschmark, which meant\nthat the United Kingdom was subject to the monetary policies enforced by the\nBundesbank. In the early 1990s, Germany aggressively increased interest rates to\navoid the inﬂationary effects related to German reuniﬁcation. However, national\npride and the commitment of ﬁxing exchange rates within the ERM prevented\nEngland from devaluing the pound. On Wednesday, September 16, also known as\nBlack Wednesday, George Soros leveraged the entire value of his fund ($1 billion) and\nsold $10 billion worth of pounds to bet against the ERM. This essentially ‘‘broke’’\nthe Bank of England and forced it to devalue the pound. In a matter of 24 hours, the\nBritish pound fell approximately 5%, or 5000 pips. The Bank of England promised\nto raise rates in order to tempt speculators to buy pounds. As a result, this caused\ntremendous volatility in the bond markets, with 1-month UK LIBOR rates rising\n1% and then retracing those gains over the next 24 hours. If bond traders were\ncompleted oblivious to what was going on in the currency markets, they would have\nprobably found themselves dumbstruck in face of such rapid gyration in yields.\n■Chinese Yuan Revaluation and Bonds\nFor Treasury traders, there’s another currency-related issue that is important to\nfollow and that is the gradual revaluation of the Chinese yuan. For most of its history,\nthe yuan or renminbi (RMB) was pegged to the U.S. dollar. In the 1980s, the RMB\nwas devalued to promote growth in C hina’s economy, and between 1997 and 2005\nthe People’s Bank of China artiﬁcially maintained a USDRMB rate of 8.27. At the\ntime, it received signiﬁcant criticism because keeping the peg meant that the Chinese\ngovernment would artiﬁcially weaken its currency to make Chinese goods more\ncompetitive. To maintain the band, the Chinese government had to sell the yuan and\nbuy U.S. dollars each time their currency appreciated above the band’s upper limit.\nThese dollars were then used to purchase U.S. Treasuries, and this practice turned\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET4China into the world’s largest holder of U.S. Treasuries. In 2005, however, China\nended its dollar peg and linked the value of the yuan to a basket of currencies and\nallowed it to ﬂuctuate within a narrow band that was reset every day. While the exact\npercentage of the basket is unknown, it is largely dominated by the U.S. dollar and\nincludes other currencies such as the euro, Japanese yen, South Korean won, British\npound, Thai baht, Russian ruble, and Australian, Canadian, and Singapore dollar.\nThrough the years China has gradually widened the band that the yuan can trade\nin, but if China were to end the ﬂoat and allow the RMB to trade freely on the\nglobal foreign exchange market, the impact on the ﬁxed-income markets would be\nsigniﬁcant because it would reduce the government’s need to purchase Treasuries\nand other ﬁxed-income securities. An announcement of this sort would send yields\nsoaring and prices tumbling. While it could be years before this happens, it will be\nimportant for bond investors to follow these developments if they want to effectively\nmanage the risk.\n■Comparing the FX Market with Futures\nand Equities\nThe foreign exchange market has not always been a popular market to trade because\nfor many decades, it was restricted to hedge funds, commodity trading advisers who\nmanage large amounts of capital, major corporations, and institutional investors\ndue to regulation, capital requirements, and technology. Yet it was the market\nof choice for many of these large players because the risk was fully customizable.\nTrader A could use a 50 times leverage, and Trader B could trade cash on cash.\nWhen the market opened up to retail traders, many brokerage ﬁrms swept in to\nprovide leveraged trading along with free instantaneous execution platforms, charts,\nand real-time news. This access to low-cost information helped foreign exchange\ntrading surge in popularity, increasing its attractiveness as an alternative asset class\nto trade.\nMany equity and futures traders also turned to currencies, adding the asset class\nto their trading portfolios. Before you choose to do so, however, it is important to\nunderstand some of the key difference s between the forex and equity markets.\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs, and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET5Characteristics of Equities Market\n1. There is decent market liquidity, but that can depend on a stock’s daily volume.\n2. The market is only available for trading 9:30am to 5pm NY Time, with limited\nafter-hours trading.\n3. The existence of exchange fees results in higher costs and commissions.\n4. There is an uptick rule to short stocks, which many day traders ﬁnd frustrating.\n5. The number of steps involved in completing a trade can increase slippage and\nerror.\nAs one of the most liquid markets in the world, the volume and liquidity present in\nthe FX markets has allowed traders to access a 24-hour market with low transaction\ncosts, high leverage, the ability to proﬁt in both bull and bear markets, minimized\nerror rates, limited slippage, and no trading curbs or uptick rules. Oftentimes, traders\ncan use the same strategies for analyzing the equity markets in the FX market. Funda-\nmental traders will ﬁnd that countries can be analyzed like stocks. Technical traders\nwill ﬁnd that the FX market is perfect for their style of analysis because of the abun-\ndance of tick data and because it is already one of the most commonly used analysis\ntools by professional traders. Now let’s take a closer look at the individual attributes\nof the FX market to really understand why this is such an attractive market to trade!\n24-Hour Market\nOne of the primary reasons why the FX market is popular is because for active\ntraders, it is the ideal market to trade. It’s 24-hour nature offers traders instant access\nto the markets at all hours of the day for immediate response to global developments.\nThis characteristic also gives traders the added ﬂexibility of determining their own\ntrading day. Active day traders no longer have to wait for the equities market to\nopen at 9:30am NY Time to begin trading. If there is a signiﬁcant announcement or\ndevelopment either domest ically or overseas bet ween 4pm NY Time and 9:30am\nNY Time, most day traders will have to wait for the exchanges to open at 9:30am\nto place trades. In all likelihood, by that time, unless you have access to electronic\ncommunication networks (ECNs) such as Instinet for premarket trading, the market\nwould have gapped up or gapped down against your favor. This is particularly\nfrustrating when important data are released at 8:30am NY Time, such as nonfarm\npayrolls. Professionals would have already priced in the outcome before the average\ntrader can even access to market.\nIn addition, many people who want to trade also have a full-time job during\nthe day. The ability to trade after hours makes the FX market a much more\nconvenient market for all traders. Different times of the day will offer different\ntrading opportunities, as the global ﬁnancial centers around the world are all actively\ninvolved in foreign exchange. With the FX m arket, trading after hours with a large\nonline FX broker provides the same liquidity and spread as any other time of day.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET6As a guideline, at 5pm Sunday NY Time, trading begins as the markets open in\nSydney, Australia. Then, the Tokyo markets open at 7 pm NY Time. Next, Singapore\nand Hong Kong open at 9pm NY Time followed by the European markets in Frankfurt\n(2am) and then London (3am). By 4am the European markets are in full swing, and\nAsia has concluded their trading day. The U.S. markets open ﬁrst in New York around\n8am Monday as Europe winds down. By 5pm, Sydney is set to reopen once again.\nThe majority of trading activity happens when the markets overlap; for example,\nAsia and Europe trading overlaps between 12am to approximately 2am, Europe and\nthe United States overlaps between 8a m to approximately 12pm NY Time, while\nthe United States and Asia overlap be tween 5pm and 9pm. During New York and\nLondon hours, all currency pairs trade actively. During the Asian hours, however,\nthe trading activity for pairs such as the GBPJPY and AUDJPY tend to peak.\nLower Transaction Costs\nLower transaction costs also makes forex an attractive asset class to trade. In the\nequity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission and with online\nequity brokers, commissions can run upwards of $20 per trade. This means that for\npositions of $100,000, average roundtrip commissions could be as high as $120.\nThe over the counter (OTC) structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which, in turn, lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Equity traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade for\nshort-term traders. For an active equity trader who typically places 30 trades a day,\nat $20 commission per trade, you would have to up to pay $600 in daily transaction\ncosts. This is a signiﬁcant amount of money that could take a large cut out of proﬁts\nor deepen losses. The reason why costs are so high is because there are a lot of\npeople involved in an equity transaction. More speciﬁcally, for each trade, there is\na broker, the exchange, and the specialist. All of these parties need to be paid, and\ntheir payment comes in the form of commission and clearing fees. In the FX market,\nbecause it is decentralized with no exchange or clearinghouse (everything is taken\ncare of by the market maker), these fees are not applicable.\nCustomizable Leverage\nEven though many people realize that higher leverage comes with risks, traders are\nhumans, and few of them ﬁnd it easy to turn away the opportunity to trade on\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET7someone else’s money. The FX market caters perfectly to these traders by offering\nthe highest leverage available for any market. Most online currency ﬁrms offer 50\ntimes leverage on regular-sized accounts and up to 200 times leverage on miniature\naccounts (abroad leverage can be as high as 400 times). Compare that to the 2 times\nleverage offered to the average equity investor and the 10 times capital that is\ntypically offered to the professional trader, and you can see why many traders have\nturned to the foreign exchange market. The margin deposit for leverage in the FX\nmarket is not seen as a down payment on a purchase of equity, as many perceive\nmargins to be in the stock markets. Rather, the margin is a performance bond, or\ngood-faith deposit, to ensure against trading losses. This is very useful to short-term\nday traders who need the enhancement in capital to generate quick returns. For the\nmore risk-averse investor, leverage is completely customizable, which means that\nif they only feel comfortable with 10 or 20 times leverage or no leverage at all,\nthey can elect to do so. It is extremely important to understand that leverage is a\ndouble-edged sword—it can magnify proﬁts but also losses.\nProﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nIn the FX market, proﬁt potentials exist in both bull and bear markets. Since\ncurrency trading always involves buying one currency and selling another, there\nis no structural bias to the market. Therefore, if you are long one currency, you\nare at the same time short another. As a result, equal proﬁt potential exists in\nboth upward-trending and downward-trending markets. This is different from the\nequities market, where most traders go long instead of short stocks, so the general\nequity investment community tends to suffer in a bear market.\nNo Trading Curbs or Uptick Rule\nThe FX market is the largest market in the world, forcing market makers to offer\nvery competitive prices. Unlike the equities market, there is never a time in the\nFX markets when trading curbs would take into effect and trading would be halted,\nonly to gap when reopened. This eliminates missed proﬁts due to archaic exchange\nregulations. In the FX market, traders would be able to place trades 24 hours a day\nwith virtually no disruptions.\nOne of the biggest annoyances for day trades in the equity market is the fact\nthat traders are prohibited from shorting a stock in a downtrend unless there is an\nuptick. This can be very frustrating as traders wait to join short sellers, but are only\nleft with continually watching the stock trend down before an uptick occurs. In the\nFX market, there is no such rule. If you want to short a currency pair, you can do\nso immediately; this allows for instant and efﬁcient execution.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET8Online Trading Reducing Error Rates\nA shorter trade process minimizes errors. Online currency trading is typically a\nthree-step process. A trader would place an order on the platform, the FX dealing\ndesk would automatically execute it electronically, and the order conﬁrmation\nwould be posted or logged onto the trader’s trading station. Typically, these three\nsteps would be completed in a matter of seconds. For an equities trade on the other\nhand, there is generally a ﬁve-step process. The client would call his broker to place\nan order, the broker sends the order to the exchange ﬂoor, the specialist on the\nﬂoor tries to match up orders (the broker competes with other brokers to get the\nbest ﬁll for the client), the specialist executes the trade, and the client receives a\nconﬁrmation from the broker. The elimination of a middleman minimizes the error\nrates in currency trades and increases the efﬁciency of each transaction.\nLimited Slippage\nUnlike the equity markets, many online FX market makers provide instantaneous\nexecution from real-time, two-way quotes. These quotes are the prices where the\nﬁrms are willing to buy or sell the quoted currency, rather than vague indications\nof where the market is trading, which may or may not be honored. Orders are\nexecuted and conﬁrmed within seconds. Robust systems would never request the\nsize of a trader’s potential order, or which side of the market he’s trading, before\ngiving him a bid/offer quote. Inefﬁcient dealers determine whether the investor is a\nbuyer or a seller, and shade the price to increase their own proﬁt on the transaction.\nThe equity market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’ system, under\nwhich you may not get executed at the price you wish, but rather at the next best\nprice available. For example, let’s say Microsoft is trading at $52.50. If you enter a\nbuy order at this rate, by the time it reaches the specialist on the exchange ﬂoor, the\nprice may have risen to $53.25. In this case, you will not get executed at $52.50;\nyou will get executed at $53.25, which is essentially a loss of 3∕4of a point. The\nprice transparency provided by the some of the better market makers assures that\ntraders always receive a fair price.\nPerfect Market for Technical Analysis\nFor technical analysts, currencies rarely spend much time in tight trading ranges and\nhave the tendency to develop strong trends. Over 80% of volume is speculative in\nnature and as a result, the market frequently overshoots and then corrects itself.\nHence, technical analysis works well for the FX market, and a technically trained\ntrader can easily identify new trends and breakouts, which provide multiple oppor-\ntunities to enter and exit positions. Charts and indicators are used by all professional\nFX market traders, and candle charts are available on most charting packages. In addi-\ntion, the most commonly used indicators such as Fibonacci retracements, stochastics,\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET9MACD, moving averages, RSI, and support/resistance levels have proven valid in\nmany instances.\nIn the USDJPY chart shown in Figure 1.1, it is clear that Fibonacci retracements,\nmoving averages, and stochastics have at one point or another given successful\ntrading signals. For example, the 61.8% retracement level served as resistance for\nUSDJPY in December 2014, January 2015, and February 2015. The moving-average\ncrossovers of the 10- and 20-day simple moving averages also successfully forecasted\nthe rally in USDJPY in late October, along with the decline in early January. Equity\ntraders who focus on technical analysis have the easiest transition, since they can\nimplement the same technical strategies that they use in the equities market into the\nFX market.\nAnalyze Stocks Like Countries\nTrading currencies is not a big challenge for fundamental traders either, because\ncountries can be analyzed like stocks. For example, if you analyze growth rates of\nstocks, you can use gross domestic product (GDP) to analyze the growth rate of\ncountries. If you analyze inventory and production ratios, you can follow industrial\nproduction (IP) or durable goods data. If you follow sales ﬁgures, you can analyze\nretail sales data. As with a stock investme n t ,i ti sb e t t e rt oi n v e s ti nt h ec u r r e n c yo fa\ncountry that is growing faster and fund it with a currency of a country that is growing\nslower. Currency prices reﬂect the balance of supply and demand for currencies.\nTwo of the primary factors affecting supply and demand of currencies are interest\nrates and the overall strength of the economy. Economic indicators such as GDP,\nforeign investment, and the trade balance reﬂect the general health of an economy\nand are therefore responsible for the underlying shifts in supply and demand for\nthat currency. There is a tremendous amount of data released at regular intervals,\nsome of which are more important than others. Data related to interest rates and\ninternational trade is the most closely followed.\nIf there is uncertainty regarding the direction of interest rates, any bit of news\non monetary policy can directly affect how the currency trades. Traditionally,\nif a country raises its interest rate, the currency of that country will strengthen\nin relation to other countries as investors shift assets to that country to gain a\nhigher return. In contrast, an interest rates hike is generally bad news for stocks\nbecause it means that borrowing costs have risen. In response, some investors will\ntransfer money out of a country’s stock market when interest rates are increased,\ncausing the country’s currency to weaken. Determining which effect dominates can\nbe tricky, but generally there is an advance consensus on how interest rates will\nmove. Indicators that have the biggest impact on interest rates are producer prices,\nconsumer prices, employment, spending, and GDP. Most of the time monetary\npolicy announcements are known in advance with meeting dates by the Bank of\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET10\nFIGURE 1.1 USDJPY Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET11England (BoE), the Federal Reserve (FED), European Central Bank (ECB), Bank\nof Japan (BoJ), and other central banks posted on their respective websites.\nAnother piece of data that can impact how currencies move is the trade balance,\nwhich shows the net differ ence over a period of time b etween a nation’s exports and\nimports. When a country imports more than it exports, the trade balance will show\na deﬁcit, which is generally considered unfavorable. For example, if U.S. dollars are\nsold for other domestic national currencies (to pay for imports), the ﬂow of dollars\noutside the country will depreciate the value of the dollar. Similarly, if trade ﬁgures\nshow an increase in exports, dollars will ﬂow into the United States and appreciate\nthe value of the dollar. From the standpoint of a national economy, a deﬁcit in and of\nitself is not necessarily a bad thing. If the deﬁcit is greater than market expectations\nhowever, it can trigger a negative price movement.\n■FX versus Futures\nTrading spot forex is also different from trading futures, and like equity traders,\nmany futures traders have also added currency spot trading into their portfolios. We\nknow that the spot forex market has the following attributes:\nCharacteristics of FX Markets\n1. It is the largest market in the world with growing liquidity.\n2. The market is open 24 hours, 5.5 days a week for trading.\n3. Proﬁts can be made in both bull and bear markets.\n4. There are no trading curbs and short selling is permitted without an uptick.\n5. Instant executable trading platform minimizes slippage and errors.\n6. Leverage can be extremely high, which can magnify proﬁts as well as losses.\nCharacteristics of Futures Markets\n1. There is limited market liquidity depending on the month of contract trades.\n2. The presence of exchange fees results in more costs and commissions.\n3. Market hours for futures trading are much shorter than spot and are dependent\non the product traded; each product may have different open and closing hours,\nand there is limited after-hours trading.\n4. Futures leverage is higher than equities, but still only a fraction of the leverage\noffered in FX.\n5. There tends to be prolonged bear markets.\n6. Pit trading structure increases error and slippage.\nLike in the equities market, traders can implement the same strategies they use\nin analyzing the futures markets in the FX m arket. Most future tr aders are technical\ntraders, and the FX market is perfect for technical analysis. In fact, it is the most\npopular analysis technique used by professional FX traders. Taking a closer look at\nhow the futures market stacks up, we see the following.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET12Comparing Market Hours and Liquidity\nThe volume traded in the FX market is estimated to be over ﬁve times that of the\nfutures market. The FX market is open for trading 24 hours a day, but the futures\nmarket has confusing market hours which vary based on the product traded. For\nexample, if you traded gold futures, it is only open for trading between 7:20am\nand 1:30pm on the COMEX. If you traded crude oil futures on the New York\nMercantile Exchange, t rading would only be ope n between 8:30am. and 2:10pm.\nThese varying hours not only create confusion but also makes it difﬁcult to act on\nbreakthrough announcements throughout the reminder of the day.\nIn addition, if you have a day job and can only trade after hours, futures would be\na very inconvenient market product to trade. You would basically be placing orders\nbased on past prices that are not current market prices. This lack of transparency\nmakes trading very cumbersome. In addition, each time zone has its own unique\nnews and developments that could move speciﬁc currency pairs, and with futures it\ncan difﬁcult to act on breaking overnight news.\nLow to Zero Transaction Costs\nIn the equity market, traders must pay a spread and/or a commission. With future\nbrokers, average commissions can run close to $160 per trade on positions of\n$100,000 or greater. The OTC structure of the FX market eliminates exchange and\nclearing fees, which can in turn lowers transaction costs. Costs are further reduced\nby the efﬁciencies created by a purely electronic market place that allows clients to\ndeal directly with the market maker, eliminating both ticket costs and middlemen.\nBecause the currency market offers round-the-clock liquidity, traders receive tight,\ncompetitive spreads day and night. Futures traders are more vulnerable to liquidity\nrisk and typically receive wider dealing spreads, especially during after-hours trading.\nLow to zero transaction costs make online FX trading the best market to trade\nfor short-term traders. If you are an active futures trader who typically places 20\ntrades a day, at $100 commission per trade, you would have to pay $2,000 in daily\ntransaction costs. A typical futures trade involves a broker, a future commissions\nmerchant (FCM) order desk, a clerk on the exchange ﬂoor, a runner, and a pit\ntrader. All of these parties need to be paid, and their payment comes in the form of\ncommission and clearing fees, whereas the electronic nature of the market minimizes\nthese costs.\nNo Limit Up or Down Rules/Proﬁt in Both Bull and Bear Markets\nUnlike the tight restriction on the futures market, there is no limit down or limit\nup rule in the FX market. For example, on the S&P index futures, if the contract\nvalue falls more than 5% from the previous day’s close, limit down rules will come\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET13in effect, whereby on a 5% move, the index would only be allowed to trade at\nor above this level for the next 10 minutes. For a 20% decline, trading would be\ncompletely halted. Due to the decentralized nature of the FX market, there are no\nexchange-enforced restrictions on daily activity, which can help eliminate missed\nopportunities caused by archaic exchange regulations.\nExecution Quality and Speed/Low Error Rates\nThe futures market is also known for inconsistent execution, both in terms of pricing\nand execution time. Every futures trader has, at some point in time, experienced\na half hour or so wait for a market order to be ﬁlled, only to ﬁnd that the order\nhas been executed at a price far away from where the market was trading when\nthe initial order was placed. Even with electronic trading and limited guarantees of\nexecution speed, the price for ﬁlls on market orders is far from certain. The reason\nfor this inefﬁciency is the number of steps that are involved in placing a futures\ntrade. A futures trade is typically a seven-step process:\n1. The client calls his broker and places his trade (or places it online).\n2. The trading desk receives the order, processes it, and routes it to the FCM\norder desk on the exchange ﬂoor.\n3. The FCM order desk passes the order to the order clerk.\n4. The order clerk hands the order to a runner or signals it to the pit.\n5. The trading clerk goes to the pit to execute the trade.\n6. The trade conﬁrmation goes to the runner or is signaled to the order clerk and\nprocessed by the FCM order desk.\n7. The broker receives the trade conﬁrmation and passes it on to the client.\nAn FX trade in comparison is typically only a three-step process. A trader would\nplace an order on the platform, the FX dealing desk would automatically execute\nit electronically, and the order conﬁrmation would be posted or logged on the\ntrader’s trading station. The elimination of the involvement of these additional\nparties increases the speed of the trade execution and decreases errors.\nIn addition, the futures market typically operates under a ‘‘next best order’’\nsystem, under which your trades frequently do not get executed at the initial market\norder price, but rather, at the next best price available. For example, let’s say a\nclient is long 5 March Dow Jones futures contracts at 8800. If the client enters a\nstop order at 8700, when the rate reaches this level, the client will most likely be\nexecuted at 8690. This 10-point difference would be attributed to slippage, which\nis very common in the futures market.\nOn most FX trading stations, traders execute directly off of real-time streaming\nprices. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, there is generally no discrepancy\nbetween the displayed price and the execution price. This holds true even during\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET14volatile times and fast-moving markets. In the futures market, execution is uncertain\nbecause all orders must be done on the exchange. This creates a situation where\nliquidity is limited by the number of participants, which, in turn, limits quantities\nthat can be traded at a given price. Real-time streaming prices ensure that market\norders, stops, and limits are executed with minimal slippage and no partial ﬁlls.\n■W h oA r et h eP l a y e r si nt h eF XM a r k e t ?\nSince the foreign exchange market is an OTC market without a centralized exchange,\ncompetition between market makers prohibits monopolisti c pricing strategies. If\none market maker attempts to drastically skew the price, then traders simply have\nthe option to ﬁnd another market maker. Moreover, spreads are closely watched to\nensure market makers are not whimsically altering the cost of the trade. Many equity\nmarkets, on the other hand, operate in a completely different fashion; the New York\nStock Exchange, for instance, is the sole place where companies listed on the NYSE\ncan have their stocks traded. Centralized markets are operated by what are referred\nto as specialists. Market makers, on the other hand, is the term used in reference to\ndecentralized marketplaces. Since the NYSE is a centralized market, a stock traded\non the NYSE can only have one bid–ask quote at all times. Decentralized markets,\nsuch as foreign exchange, can have multiple market makers—all of whom have the\nright to quote different prices. Here is an illustration of how both centralized and\ndecentralized markets operate.\nCentralized Markets\nBy their very nature, centralized markets tend to be monopolistic: With a single\nspecialist controlling th e market, prices can easil y be skewed to a ccommodate the\ninterests of the specialist, not those of the traders (see Figure 1.2). If, for example,\nthe market is ﬁlled with sellers that the specialists must buy from but no prospective\nbuyers on the other side, the specialist may simply widen the spread, thereby\nBuyers\nCan buy only\nfrom one\nspecialistSpecialist\nUnites buyers and\nsellers; maintains\nsole control over\nthe spreadSellers\nCan sell only to\none specialist\nFIGURE 1.2 Centralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET15increasing the cost of the trade and preventing additional participants from entering\nthe market. Or, specialists can drastically alter the quotes they are offering, thus\nmanipulating the price to accommodate their own risk tolerance.\nHierarchy of Participants\nWhile the foreign exchange market is decentralized, and hence employs multiple\nmarket makers rather than a single specialist, participants in the FX market are\norganized into a hierarchy; those with superior credit access, volume transacted,\nand sophistication receive priority pricing in the market (see Figure 1.3). At the\ntop of the food chain is the interbank market, which trades the highest volume per\nday in relatively few currencies. In the interbank market, the largest banks can deal\nwith each other directly, via interbank brokers, or through electronic brokering\nsystems like EBS or Reuters. The interbank market is a credit-approved system,\nwhere banks trade based solely on the credit relationships they have established\nwith one another. The banks can see the rates everyone is dealing at, but each bank\nmust have a speciﬁc credit relationship with that bank in order to trade at the rates\nbeing offered. Other institutions such as online FX market makers, hedge funds,\nand corporations must trade FX through these banks, although some have created\ntheir own liquidity pools through the years. Many banks (e.g., small community\nbanks or banks in emerging markets), corporations, and institutional investors do\nnot have access to these rates because they have no established credit lines with\nbig banks. This forces smaller participants to deal through just one bank for their\nRetail Clients\nTrader\nTrader\nTrader\nTraderOnline TradingInterbank Market\nBank Bank\nBank BankEBS and\nReutersOnline FX\nMarket\nMakers\nFIGURE 1.3 Decentralized Market Structure\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE—THE FASTEST GROWING MARKET16foreign exchange needs, and oftentimes this means much less competitive rates for\nthe participants further down the participant hierarchy. Those receiving the least\ncompetitive rates are customers of banks and physical currency exchange companies.\nRecently, technology has broken down the barriers that used to stand between the\nend-users of foreign exchange services and the interbank market. The online trading\nrevolution opened its doors to retail clientele by connecting market makers and\nmarket participants in an efﬁcient, low-cost manner. In essence, online trading\nplatforms serve as a gateway to the liquid FX market. Average traders can now\ntrade alongside the biggest banks in the world, with virtually similar pricing and\nexecution. What used to be a game dominated and controlled by the ‘‘big boys’’ is\nslowly becoming a level playing ﬁeld where individuals can proﬁt and take advantage\nof the same opportunities as big banks. FX is no longer an old boys club, which\nmeans opportunities abound for aspiring online currency traders.\nDealing Stations— Interbank Market\nFor serious traders who want to know more about the interbank market, the\nmajority of FX volume is actually transacted primarily through the interbank\nmarket. The leading banks of the world trade with each other electronically\nover two platforms—the EBS and Reuters, dealing 3000-spot matching. Both\nplatforms offer trading in the major currency pairs; however, certain currency\npairs are more liquid and generally more frequently traded over one versus the\nother. Some cross-currency pairs are traded over these platforms as well, but\nothers are calculated from the rates of the major currency pairs and are then offset\nusing the ‘‘legs.’’ For example, if an interbank trader had a client who wanted to\ngo long NZDCAD, the trader would most likely buy NZDUSD and USDCAD\nseparately. The trader would then multiply these rates and provide the client with\nthe respective NZDCAD rate, creating a synthetic quote and trade.\n17CHAPTER 2\nHistorical Events in\nthe FX Markets\nBefore learning how to trade currencies, it is important for every new and\nseasoned market participant to have some understanding about the most\nimportant historical events that have shaped the currency market. To this day, these\nevents are often referenced by professional traders.\n■Bretton Woods: Anointing the Dollar as the World\nCurrency (1944)\nIn July 1944, representatives of 44 nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire,\nto create a new institutional arrangement for governing the international economy\nin the years following World War II. Most agreed that international economic\ninstability was one of the principle causes of the war, and that such instability needed\nto be prevented in the future. The agreement, which was developed by renowned\neconomists John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White, was initially proposed\nto Great Britain as a part of the Lend Lease Act—an American act designed to assist\nGreat Britain in postwar redevelopment efforts. After various negotiations, the ﬁnal\nform of the Bretton Woods Agreement consisted of three key items:\n1. The formation of key international authorities designed to promote fair trade\nand international economic harmony\n2. The ﬁxation of exchange rates between currencies\n3. The convertibility between gold and t he U.S. dollar, thus empowering the U.S.\ndollar as the reserve currency of choice for the world\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS18Of these three parameters, only the ﬁrst is still in existence today, but the\norganizations formed as a direct result of Bretton Woods include the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT); and they all play a crucial role in modern day development and regulation\nof international economies. Since the demise of Bretton Woods, the IMF has\nworked closely with the World Bank. Toge ther, the two institutions now regularly\nlend funds to developing nations, assisting them in the development of a public\ninfrastructure capable of supporting a sound mercantile economy that can contribute\nin the international arena. In order to ensure that these nations can actually enjoy\nequal and legitimate access to trade with their industrialized counterparts, the World\nBank and IMF must work closely with GATT. While GATT was initially meant to\nbe a temporary organization, it now operates to encourage the dismantling of trade\nbarriers—namely, tariffs and quotas.\nThe Bretton Woods Agreement existed from 1944 to 1971, after which it\nwas replaced by the Smithsonian Agreement, an international contract pioneered\nby U.S. President Richard Nixon out the necessity to accommodate for Bretton\nWoods’ shortcomings. Unfortunately, the Smithsonian Agreement possessed the\nsame critical weakness: While it did not include gold/U.S. dollar convertibility,\nit maintained ﬁxed exchange rates—a facet that did not accommodate the United\nStates’ ongoing trade deﬁcit and the international need for a weaker U.S. dollar. As\na result, the Smithsonian Agreement was short-lived.\nUltimately, the exchange rates of t he world evolved into a free market,\nwhere supply and demand were the sole criteria that determined the value of a\ncurrency. While this did and still does result in a number of currency crises and\ngreater volatility between currencies, it also allowed the market to become self-\nregulating, and thus could dictate the appropriate value of a currency without any\nhindrances.\nAs for Bretton Woods, perhaps its most memorable contribution to the interna-\ntional economic arena was its role in changing the international perception about the\nU.S. dollar. While the euro is a revolutionary currency blazing new frontiers in both\nsocial behavior and international trade, the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve\ncurrency of choice. This is due, in large part, to the Bretton Woods Agreement:\nBy establishing dollar/gold convertibility, the dollar’s role as the world’s most\naccessible and reliable currency was ﬁrmly cemented. So while Bretton Woods\nmight be a doctrine of yesteryear, its impact on the U.S. dollar and international\neconomics still resonates today.\n■The End of Bretton Woods: Free Market\nCapitalism Is Born (1971)\nOn August 15, 1971, it became ofﬁcial: The Bretton-Woods system was abandoned\nonce and for all. While it had been exorcised before—only to subsequently emerge\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS19in a new form—this ﬁnal eradication of the Bretton Woods system was truly its\nlast stand: No longer would currencies be ﬁxed in value to gold, allowed only to\nﬂuctuate in a 1% range, but instead, their fair valuation could be determined by\nfree-market behavior such as trade ﬂows and foreign direct investment.\nAlthough U.S. President Nixon was conﬁdent that the end of the Bretton Woods\nsystem would bring about better times for the international economy, he was\nnot a believer that the free market could dictate a currency’s true valuation in a\nfair and catastrophe-free manner. Nixon and many well-respected economists at\nthe time reasoned that an entirely unstructured foreign exchange market would\nresult in competing devaluations, which, in turn, would lead to the breakdown of\ninternational trade and investment. The end result, Nixon and his board of economic\nadvisors argued, would be global depression.\nIn response, the Smithsonian Agreement was introduced a few months later.\nHailed by President Nixon as the ‘‘greatest monetary agreement in the history of\nthe world,’’ the Smithsonian Agreement strived to maintain ﬁxed exchange rates\nwithout the backing of gold. Its key difference from the Bretton Woods system was\nthat the value of the dollar could ﬂoat in a range of 2.25%, compared to just 1%\nunder Bretton Woods.\nUltimately, the Smithsonian Agreement proved to be unfeasible as well. Without\nexchange rates ﬁxed to gold, the free market gold price shot up to $215 per\nounce. Moreover, the U.S. trade deﬁcit continued to grow, and from a fundamental\nstandpoint, the U.S. dollar needed to be devalued beyond the 2.25% parameters\nestablished by the Smithsonian Agreement. In light of these problems, the foreign\nexchange markets were forced to close in February 1972.\nThe markets reopened in March 1973, and this time, they were not bound by a\nSmithsonian Agreement: The value of the US dollar was to be determined entirely\nby the market, as its value was not ﬁxed to any commodity, nor was its exchange rate\nﬂuctuation conﬁned to certain parameters. While this did provide the U.S. dollar,\nand other currencies by default, the agility required to adapt to a new and rapidly\nevolving international trading environment, it also set the stage for unprecedented\ninﬂation. The end of Bretton Woods and the Smithsonian Agreement, as well as\nconﬂicts in the Middle East, resulted in substantially higher oil prices and helped\nto create stagﬂation—the synthesis of unemployment and inﬂation—in the U.S.\neconomy. It would not be until later in the decade, when Federal Reserve Chairman\nPaul Volcker initiated new economic policies and President Reagan introduced a new\nﬁscal agenda, that the U.S. dollar would return to ‘‘normal’’ valuations. By then,\nthe foreign exchange markets had thoroughly developed and were capable of serving\na multitude of purposes. In addition to employing a laissez-faire style of regulation\non international trade, they also were beginning to attract speculators seeking to\nparticipate in a market with unrivaled liquidity and continued growth. Ultimately,\nthe death of Bretton Woods in 1971 marked the beginning of a new economic era, one\nthat liberated international trading while also proliferating speculative opportunities.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS20■Plaza Accord—Devaluation\nof the U.S. Dollar (1985)\nAfter the demise of all the various exchange rate regulatory mechanisms that\ncharacterized the twentieth century—t hat is, the Gold Standard, the Bretton\nWoods Standard, and the Smithsonian Agreement—the currency market was left\nwith virtually no regulation other than the mythical ‘‘invisible hand’’ of free\nmarket capitalism, one that supposedly strived to create economic balance through\nsupply and demand. Unfortunately, due to a number of unforeseen economic\nevents—such as the OPEC oil crises, stagﬂation throughout the 1970s, and drastic\nchanges in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ﬁscal policy—supply and demand, in and\nof themselves, became insufﬁcient means by which the currency markets could be\nregulated. A system of sorts was needed, but not one that was inﬂexible: Fixation of\ncurrency values to a commodity, such as gold, proved to be too rigid for economic\ndevelopment, as was also the notion of ﬁxing maximum exchange rate ﬂuctuations.\nThe balance between structure and rigidity was one that had plagued the currency\nmarkets throughout the twentieth century, and while advancements had been made,\na deﬁnitive solution was still greatly needed.\nHence, in 1985, the respective ministers of ﬁnance and central bank governors\nof the world’s leading economies—France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom,\nand the United States—convened in New York City, with the hopes of arranging a\ndiplomatic agreement that would work to optimize the economic effectiveness of\nthe foreign exchange markets. Meeting at the Plaza Hotel, the international leaders\ncame to the following agreements regarding speciﬁc economies and the international\neconomy as a whole:\n■Across the world, inﬂation was at very low levels. Contrary to the stagﬂation of\nthe 1970s—where inﬂation was high and real economic growth was low—the\nglobal economy in 1985 had done a complete 180, as inﬂation was now low and\ngrowth was strong.\n■While low inﬂation, even when coupled with robust economic growth, still\nallowed for low interest rates—a caveat that developing countries particularly\nenjoyed—there was an imminent danger of protectionist policies such as tariffs\nentering the economy. The United States was experiencing a large and growing\ncurrent account deﬁcit, while Japan and Germany were facing large and growing\nsurpluses. An imbalance so fundamental in nature could create serious economic\ndisequilibrium, which, in turn, would result in a distortion of the foreign exchange\nmarkets, and thus, the international economy as a whole.\n■The results of current account imbalances, and the protectionist policies that\nensued, required action. Ultimately, it was believed that the rapid acceleration\nin the value of the U.S. dollar, which appreciated more than 80% against the\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS21currencies of its major trading partners, was the primary culprit. The rising\nvalue of the U.S. dollar created enormous trade deﬁcits, hurting many different\neconomies.\nAt the meeting in the Plaza Hotel, the Uni ted States persuad ed other attending\ncountries to coordinate a multilateral intervention, and on September 22, 1985,\nthe Plaza Accord was implemented. This agreement was designed to allow for\na controlled decline of the dollar and the appreciation of the main anti-dollar\ncurrencies. Each country agreed to changes to their economic policies and to\nintervene in currency markets as necessary to weaken the value of the dollar. The\nUnited States agreed to cut its budget deﬁcit and lower interest rates. France, the\nUnited Kingdom, Germany, and Japan agreed to raise interest rates. Germany also\nagreed to tax cuts, while Japan agreed to let the value of the yen ‘‘fully reﬂect\nthe underlying strength of the Japanese economy.’’ However, one major problem\nwas that not every country adhered to their pledges made under the Plaza Accord.\nThe United States, in particular, did not follow through with its initial promise to\ncut the budget deﬁcit. Japan was severely hurt by the sharp rise in the yen, as its\nexporters were unable to remain competitive overseas, and it is argued that this\neventually triggered a 10-year recession in Japan. The United S tates, on the other\nhand, enjoyed considerable growth and price stability as a result of the agreement.\nThe effects of the multilateral intervention were seen immediately, and within\nless than two years, the dollar fell 46% and 50% against the German deutschemark\nand the Japanese yen, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.1.

This gradually resolved\nthe current account deﬁcits for the time being, and also ensured that protectionist\npolicies were minimal and nonthreatening. But perhaps most importantly, the\nPlaza Accord cemented the role of the central banks in regulating exchange rate\nmovement—yes, the rates would not be ﬁxed, and hence would be determined\nprimarily by supply and demand; but ultimately, such an invisible hand is insufﬁcient,\nand it was the right and responsibility of the world’s central banks to intervene on\nbehalf of the international economy when necessary.\n■George Soros—The Man Who Broke the Bank\nof England\nWhen George Soros placed a $10 billion speculative bet on the UK pound and\nwon, he became universally known as ‘‘the man who broke the Bank of England.’’\nWhether you love him or hate him, Soros led the charge in one of the most\nfascinating events in currency trading history. Here are the details.\nThe UK Joins the Exchange Rate Mechanism\nIn 1979, a Franco-German initiative set up the European Monetary System (EMS) to\nstabilize exchange rates, reduce inﬂation, and prepare for monetary integration. The\nExchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), one of the EMS’s main components, gave each\nparticipatory currency a central exchange rate against a basket of currencies, the\nEuropean Currency Unit (ECU). Participants (initially France, Germany, Italy, the\nNetherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and Luxemburg) were then required to\nmaintain their exchange rates within a 2.25% ﬂuctuation band above or below each\nbilateral central rate. The ERM was an adjustable-peg system, and nine realignments\nwould occur between 1979 and 1987. Whil e the United Kingdom was not one of\nthe original members, it would eventually join in 1990 at a rate of DM2.95 to the\npound and with a ﬂuctuation band of +/–6%.\nUntil mid-1992, the ERM appeared to be a success, as a disciplinary effect\nhad reduced inﬂation throughout Europe under the leadership of the German\nBundesbank. The stability wouldn’t last, however, as international investors started\nworrying that the exchange rate values of several currencies within the ERM\nwere inappropriate. Following German reuniﬁcation in 1989 government spending\nsurged, forcing the Bundesbank to print more money. This led to high inﬂation\nand left the German central bank with little choice but to increase interest rates.\nHowever, the rate hike came with consequences as it placed upward pressure on\nthe German mark. This forced other central banks to raise their interest rates as\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS23well as to maintain their pegged currency exchange rates (a direct application of\nIrving Fischer’s interest parity theory). Realizing that the UK’s weak economy and\nhigh unemployment rate would not permit the British government to maintain this\npolicy for long, George Soros stepped into action.\nSoros Bets Against the Success of UK Involvement in the ERM\nThe quantum hedge fund manager essentially wanted to bet that the pound would\ndepreciate because the United Kingdom would either devalue the pound or leave the\nERM. Thanks to the progressive removal of capital controls during the EMS years,\ninternational investors at the time had more freedom than ever to take advantage\nof perceived disequilibria, so Soros established short positions in pounds and long\npositions in marks by borrowing pounds and investing in mark-denominated assets.\nHe also made great use of options and futures. In all, his positions accounted for\na gargantuan $10 billion. Soros was not the only one; many other investors soon\nfollowed suit. Everyone was selling pounds, placing tremendous downward pressure\non the currency.\nAt ﬁrst, the Bank of England (BoE) tried to defend the pegged rates by buying\n15 billion pounds with its large reserve assets, but its sterilized interventions\n(whereby the monetary base is held constant thanks to open market interventions)\nwere limited in their effectiveness. The pound was trading dangerously close to the\nlower levels of its ﬁxed band. On September 16, 1992, a day that would later be\nknown as Black Wednesday, the bank announced a 2% rise in interest rates (from\n10% to 12%) in an attempt to boost the pound’s appeal. A few hours later, it\npromised to raise rates again to 15%, but international investors such as Soros could\nnot be swayed, knowing that huge proﬁts were right around the corner. Traders\nkept selling pounds in huge volumes, and the BoE kept buying them until, ﬁnally, at\n7:00 pm that same day, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced that Britain would\nleave the ERM and that rates would return to their initial level of 10%. The chaotic\nBlack Wednesday marked the beginning of a steep depreciation in the pound’s\neffective value.\nWhether the return to a ﬂoating currency was due to the Soros-led attack on\nthe pound or because of simple fundamental analysis is still debated today. What\nis certain, however, is that the pound’s depreciation of almost 15% against the\ndeutschemark and 25% against the dollar over the next ﬁve weeks as seen in Figure 2.2\nand Figure 2.3 resulted in tremendous proﬁts for Soros and others traders (the pound\nalso weakened by a similar proportion to the dollar). Within a month, the quantum\nfund cashed in on approximately $2 billion by selling the now more expensive\nDMs and buying back the now cheaper pounds. ‘‘The man who broke the Bank of\nEngland’’ showed how central banks can still be vulnerable to speculative attacks.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS243.00British Pound vs. Deutschemark (GBPDEM)\n2.90\n2.80\n2.70\n2.60\n2.50\n2.40\n2.30\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.2 GBPDEM after Soros\n2.10\n2.00\n1 .90\n1 .80\n1 .70\n1 .60\n1 .50\n1 .40British Pound Against US Dollar GBPUSD\n1/3/19921/17/19921/31/19922/14/19922/28/19923/13/19923/27/19924/10/19924/24/19925/8/19925/22/19926/5/19926/19/19927/3/19927/17/19927/31/19928/14/19928/28/19929/11/19929/25/199210/9/199210/23/199211/6/199211/20/199212/4/199212/18/1992\nFIGURE 2.3 GBPUSD after Soros\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS25■Asian Financial Crisis (1997–1998)\nFalling like a set of dominos on July 2, 1997, the relatively nascent Asian tiger\neconomies provide the perfect example of the interdependence in global capital\nmarkets and their subsequent effects throughout international currency forums.\nBased on several fundamental breakdowns, the cause of the ‘‘contagion’’ stemmed\nlargely from shrouded lending practices, inﬂated trade deﬁcits, and immature capital\nmarkets. Compiled, these factors contributed to a perfect storm that left major\nregional markets incapacitated and once-prized currencies devalued to signiﬁcantly\nlower levels. With adverse effects easily seen in the equities markets, currency\nmarket ﬂuctuations were negatively impacted in much the same manner during this\ntime period.\nThe Bubble\nLeading up to 1997, investors had become increasingly attracted to Asian investment\nprospects, focusing on real estate development and domestic equities. As a result,\nforeign investment capital ﬂowed into the region as economic growth rates climbed\non improved production in countries like Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and\nKorea. Thailand, home of the baht, experienced a 6.5% growth rate in 1996, falling\nfrom 13% in 1988. Lending additional support for a stronger economy was the\nenactment of a ﬁxed currency peg to the U.S. dollar. With a ﬁxed valuation to\nthe greenback, countries like Thailand could ensure ﬁnancial stability in their own\nmarkets and a constant rate for export trading purposes with the world’s largest\neconomy. Ultimately, the region’s national currencies appreciated, as underlying\nfundamentals were justiﬁed and increased speculative positions of further climbs in\nprice mounted.\nBallooning Current Account Deﬁcits and Nonperforming Loans\nHowever, in early 1997, a shift in sentiment began to occur as international account\ndeﬁcits became increasingly difﬁcult for respective governments to handle and\nlending practices were revealed to be detrimental to the economic infrastructure. In\nparticular, economists were alerted to the fact that Thailand’s current account deﬁcit\nballooned in 1996 to $14.7 billion and had been climbing since 1992. Although\ncomparatively smaller than the U.S. deﬁcit, the gap represented 8% of the country’s\ngross domestic product. Shrouded lending practices also contributed heavily to\nthese breakdowns, as close personal relationships with high-ranking banking ofﬁcials\nwere well rewarded and surprisingly common throughout the region. In particular\nthis affected many of South Korea’s highly leveraged conglomerates as total\nnonperforming loan values skyrocketed to 7.5 percent of gross domestic product.\nAdditional evidence of these practices could be observed in ﬁnancial institutions\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS26throughout Japan. First announcing questionable and nonperforming loans of\n$136 billion in 1994, Japanese authorities admitted to an alarming $400 billion\ntotal a year later. Coupled with a then-crippled stock market, cooling real estate\nvalues, and dramatic slowdowns in the economy, investors saw opportunity in\na depreciating yen, subsequently adding selling pressure to neighbor currencies.\nWhen their own asset bubble collapsed, asset prices fell by $10 trillion, with\nthe fall in real estate prices accounting for nearly 65% of the total decline—the\nlosses were worth two years of national output. This fall in asset prices sparked\nthe banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early 1990s and then developed into a\nfull-blown, systemic crisis in 1997, following the failure of a number of high-proﬁle\nﬁnancial institutions. In response, Japanese monetary authorities issued rhetoric on\npotentially increasing benchmark interest rates in hopes of defending the domestic\ncurrency valuation. Unfortunately, these considerations never materialized and a\nshortfall ensued. Sparked mainly by an announcement of a managed ﬂoat of the Thai\nbaht, the slide snowballed as central bank reserves evaporated and currency price\nlevels became unsustainable in light of downside selling pressure.\nCurrency Crisis\nFollowing mass short speculation and attempted intervention, the aforementioned\nAsian economies were left ruined and momentarily incapacitated. The Thailand baht,\na once-prized possession, was devalued by as much as 48 percent, even slumping\ncloser to a 100% fall at the turn of the new year.

Additionally, it\nshowed the inability of central banks to successfully intervene in currency valuations\nwith the absence of secure economic fundamentals and overwhelming market forces.\nToday, with the assistance of IMF reparation packages and the implementation of\nstricter requirements, Asia’s four little dragons are healthy once again. With inﬂa-\ntionary benchmarks and a revived exporting market, Southeast Asia is building back\nits once prominent stature among the world’s industrialized economic regions. With\nthe experience of evaporating currency reserves under their belt, the Asian tigers\nnow take active initiatives to ensure that there is large pot of reserves on hand in\ncase speculators attempt to attack their currencies once again.\n■Introduction of the Euro (1999)\nThe introduction of the euro was a monumental achievement, marking the largest\nmonetary changeover ever. The euro was ofﬁcially launched as an electronic trading\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS28currency on January 1, 1999. Euro notes and coins were put into circulation in 2002.\nThe 11 initial member states were: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy,\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, and Finland. As of 2015, there\nare 17 countries in the Eurozone. Each country ﬁxed its currency to a speciﬁc\nconversion rate against the euro, and a common monetary policy governed by the\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) was adopted. To many economists, the system would\nideally include all of the original 15 EU nations, but the United Kingdom, Sweden,\nand Denmark decided to keep their own currencies. In deciding whether to adopt\nthe euro, EU members have many important factors to consider.\nThe 1993 Maastricht Treaty sets out ﬁve main convergence criteria for member\nstates to participate in the European Monetary Union (EMU):\nMaastricht Treaty: C onvergence Criteria\n■The country’s government budget deﬁcit could not be greater than 3% of GDP.\n■The country’s government debt could not be larger than 60% of GDP.\n■The country’s exchange rate had to be maintained within ERM bands without any\nrealignment for two years prior to joining.\n■The country’s inﬂation rate could not be higher than 1.5% above the average\ninﬂation rate of the three EU countries with the lowest inﬂation rates.\n■The country’s long-term interest rate on government bonds could not be higher\nthan 2% above the average of the comparable rates in the three countries with the\nlowest inﬂation.\nAlthough the ease of traveling is one of the most attractive reasons to join the\neuro, being part of the monetary union provides other beneﬁts:\n■It eliminates exchange rate ﬂuctuations, providing a more stable environment to\ntrade within the euro area.\n■The purging of all exchange rate risk within the zone allows businesses to plan\ninvestment decisions with greater certainty.\n■Transaction costs also diminish, mainly those relating to foreign exchange\noperations, hedging operations, cross-border payments, and the management of\nseveral currency accounts.\n■Prices become more transparent as consumers and businesses can compare prices\nacross countries more easily, which, in turn, increases competition.\n■A huge single currency market becomes more attractive for foreign investors.\n■The economy’s magnitude and stability allow the ECB to control inﬂation with\nlower interest rates, thanks to increased credibility.\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS\nk\nk29\nk\nk\nFIGURE 2.6 EURUSD Price Since Launch\nSource: eSignal\nHISTORICAL EVENTS IN THE FX MARKETS30Yet the euro is not without its limitations. Leaving aside political sovereignty\nissues, the main problem is that, by adopting the euro, a nation essentially forfeits\nany independent monetary policy. Since each country’s economy is not perfectly\ncorrelated to the EMU’s economy, a nation might ﬁnd the ECB hiking interest\nrates during a domestic recession. This can be particularly true for many of the\nsmaller nations. As a result, countries try to rely more heavily on ﬁscal policy, but\nthe efﬁciency of ﬁscal policy is limited when it is not effectively combined with\nmonetary policy. This inefﬁciency is further exacerbated by the 3% of GDP limit on\nbudget deﬁcits, as stipulated by the Stability and Growth Pact.\nSome concerns also subsist regarding the ECB’s effectiveness as a central bank.\nThe central bank strives for a 2% inﬂation target, but in the past 15 years, it strayed\naway from this level often. Also, from 1999 to late 2002, a lack of conﬁdence\nin the union’s currency (and in the union itself) led to a 24% depreciation, from\napproximately $1.15 to the euro in January 1999 to $0.88 in May 2000, forcing\nthe ECB to intervene in foreign exchange markets in the last few months of 2000.\nFigure 2.6 shows a daily chart of the euro since it was launched in 1999.\nSince 2000, things have greatly changed, with the euro trading at a premium to\nthe dollar, but quantitative easing in 2014 put the currency back in a downtrend\nversus the dollar. Some analysts claim that the euro will one day replace the dollar\nas the world’s dominant international currency, and while we believe it will have a\ngreater share in reserve portfolios, we doubt that this will be likely.\n31CHAPTER 3\nWhat Moves the\nCurrency Market?\nNow that we know a little bit about the history of the forex market, let’s take a\nlook at what moves currencies. There are two primary ways to analyze ﬁnancial\nmarkets: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis is rooted\nin understanding underlying economic conditions, while technical analysis uses\nhistorical prices to predict future movements. For as long as technical analysis\nhas been around, there has been an ongoing debate as to which methodology\nis more successful. Short-term traders prefer to use technical analysis, focusing\ntheir strategies primarily on price action, while medium-term traders tend to use\nfundamental analysis to determine a currency’s current and future valuation.\nBefore implementing successful trading strategies, it is important to understand\nwhat drives the movements of currencies in the foreign exchange market. The\nbest strategies tend to be the ones that combine both fundamental and technical\nanalysis. Textbook perfect technical formations have failed too often because of\nmajor fundamental news and events like U.S. nonfarm payrolls. But trading on\nfundamentals alone can also be risky. There will oftentimes be sharp gyrations in\nthe price of currency on a day when there are no news or economic reports. This\nsuggests that the price action is driven by nothing more than ﬂows, sentiment, and\npattern formations. Therefore, it is very important for technical traders to be aware\nof the key economic data or events that are scheduled for release, and, in turn,\nfor fundamental traders to be aware of important technical levels that the general\nmarket may be focusing on.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?32■Fundamental Analysis\nFundamental analysis focuses on the economic, social, and political forces that drive\nsupply and demand. Those using fundamental analysis as a trading tool look at\nvarious macroeconomic indicators such as growth rates, interest rates, inﬂation,\nand unemployment. We outlined some of the most important economic releases\nin the ﬁrst chapter of this book. Fundamental analysts will combine all of this\ninformation to assess current and future performance. This requires a lot of work\nand thorough analysis, as there is no single set of beliefs that guides fundamental\nanalysis. Traders employing fundamental analysis need to continually keep abreast\nof news and announcements, as they can indicate potential changes to the economic,\nsocial, and political environment. All traders should be aware of the broad economic\nconditions before placing trades. This is especially important for day traders who\nare trying to make trading decisions based on news events because even though\nFederal Reserve Monetary Policy decisions are always important, if the rate move is\ncompletely priced into the market, then the actual reaction in the EURUSD could\nbe nominal.\nTaking a step back, currencies move primarily based on supply and demand.\nThat is, on the most fundamental level, a currency rallies because there is demand\nfor that currency. Regardless of whether the demand is for hedging, speculative,\nor conversion purposes, true movements are based on the need for the currency.\nCurrency values decrease when there is excess supply. Supply and demand should be\nthe real determinants for predicting future movements. However, how to predict\nsupply and demand is not as simple as many would think. There are many factors\nthat contribute to the net supply and demand for a currency. This includes capital\nﬂows, trade ﬂows, speculative, and hedging needs.\nFor example, the U.S. dollar was very strong (against the euro) between 1999\nand the end of 2001. This rally was driven primarily by the dot-com boom and the\ndesire by foreign investors to participate in these elevated returns. This demand\nfor U.S. assets required foreign investors to sell their local currencies and purchase\nU.S. dollars. Since the end of 2001, geopolitical uncertainty arose, the United States\nstarted cutting interest rates, and foreign investors started to sell U.S. assets in\nsearch of higher yields elsewhere. This required foreign investors to sell U.S. dollars,\nincreasing supply and lowering the dollar’s value against other major currency pairs.\nThe availability of funding or interest in buying a currency is a major factor that can\nimpact the direction that a currency trades. It was one of the primary drivers of the\nU.S. dollar between 2002 and 2005, making foreign ofﬁcial purchases of U.S. assets\n(also known as the Treasury International Capital Flow, or TIC data) an important\neconomic indicator.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?33Capital and Trade Flows\nCapital ﬂows and trade ﬂows constitute a country’s balance of payments, which\nquantiﬁes the amount of demand for a currency over a given period of time.\nTheoretically, a balance of payments equal to zero is required for a currency to\nmaintain its current valuation. A negative balance of payments number, on the other\nhand, indicates that capital is leaving the economy at a more rapid rate than it is\nentering, and hence, it should fall in value.\nThis is particularly important in current conditions (at the time of this book’s\npublication), where the United States is running a consistently large trade deﬁcit\nwithout sufﬁcient foreign inﬂow to fund that deﬁcit. As a result of this very problem,\nthe trade-weighted dollar index fell 22% in value between 2003 and 2005. The\nJapanese yen is another good example. As one of the world’s largest exporters, Japan\nruns a very high trade surplus. Therefore, despite a zero interest rate policy that\nprevents capital ﬂows from increasing, the yen has a natural tendency to trade lower\nbased on trade ﬂows, which is the other side of the equation. To be more speciﬁc,\nfollowing is a more detailed explanation of what capital and trade ﬂows encompass.\nCapital Flows\nCapital ﬂows measure the net amount of a currency that is being purchased or sold\ndue to capital investments. A positive capital ﬂow balance implies that foreign inﬂows\nof physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed outﬂows. A negative\ncapital ﬂow balance indicates that there are more physical or portfolio investments\nbought by domestic investors than foreign investors. There are generally two types\nof capital ﬂows—physical ﬂows and portfolio ﬂows (which are further segmented\ninto equity markets and ﬁxed-income markets).\nPhysical Flows\nPhysical ﬂows encompass actual foreign direct investments by corporations such as\ninvestments in real estate, manufacturing, and local acquisitions. All of these require\nthat a foreign corporation sell its local currency and buy the foreign currency, which\nleads to movements in the FX market. This is particularly important for global\nmergers and corporate acquisitions that involve more cash than stock.\nPhysical ﬂows are important to watch, as they represent the underlying changes\nin actual physical investment activity. These ﬂows shift in response to changes in\neach country’s ﬁnancial health and growth opportunities. Changes in local laws that\nencourage foreign investment also serve to promote physical ﬂows. For example,\ndue to China’s entry into the WTO, its foreign investment laws have been relaxed.\nAs a result of China’s cheap labor and attractive revenue opportunities (population\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?34of over 1 billion), corporations globally have ﬂooded China with investments. From\nan FX perspective, in order to fund investments in China, foreign corporations need\nto sell their local currency and buy Chinese renminbi (RMB).\nPortfolio Flows in Equity Markets\nAs technology has enabled greater ease with respect to transportation of capital,\ninvesting in global equity markets has become far more feasible. Accordingly, a\nrallying stock market in any part of the world serves as an ideal opportunity for all,\nregardless of geographic location. The result of this has become a strong correlation\nbetween a country’s equity markets and its currency: If the equity market is rising,\ninvestment dollars generally come in to seize the opportunity. Alternatively, falling\nequity markets could prompt domestic investors to sell their shares of local publicly\ntraded ﬁrms to take advantage of investment opportunities abroad.\nThe attraction of equity markets over ﬁxed-income markets has increased across\nthe years. Since the early 1990s, the ratio of foreign transactions in U.S. government\nbonds over U.S. equities has declined from 10 to 1 to 2 to 1. As indicated in\nFigure 3.1, it is evident that the Dow had a high correlation (of approximately 81%)\nwith the U.S. dollar (against the EUR) between 1994 and 1999. In addition, from\n1991–1999, the Dow increased 300%, while the USD index appreciated nearly 30%\nfor the same time period. As a result, currency traders closely followed the global\nequity markets to predict short and intermediate term equity-based capital ﬂows.\nHowever, this relationship shifted after the tech bubble burst in the United States as\n1/31/9412500 1. 15\n1. 10\n1 .05\n1 .00\n0.95\n0.90\n0.85\n0.80\n0.75\n0.70\n0.6511500\n10500\n9500\n8500\n7500\n6500\n5500\n4500\n3500\n6/30/94 11/30/94 4/28/95 9/29/95 2/29/96 7/31/96 12/31/96Dow Jones and USDEUR\n5/30/97 10/31/97 3/31/98 8/31/98 1/29/99 6/30/99 11/30/99INDU Index Px Last USDEUR Curncy\nFIGURE 3.1 Dow and USDEUR\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?35foreign investors remained relatively risk averse causing a lower correlation between\nthe performance of the U.S. equity market and the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, a\nrelationship still exists, making it important for all traders to keep an eye on global\nmarket performances in search of intermarket opportunities.\nPortfolio Flows in Fixed-Income Markets\nJust as the equity market is correlated to exchange rate movement, so too is the\nﬁxed-income market. In times of global uncertainty, ﬁxed-income investments can\nbecome particularly appealing, due to the inherent safety they possess. As a result,\neconomies boasting the most valuable ﬁxed-income opportunities will be capable of\nattracting foreign investment—which will naturally ﬁrst require the purchasing of\nthe country’s respective currency.\nA good gauge of ﬁxed-income capital ﬂows are the short- and long-term yields of\ninternational government bonds. It is important to monitor the spread differential\nbetween the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the yield on foreign bonds because\ninternational investors tend to move money from one country to another in search\nof the highest yielding assets. When U.S. assets have one of the highest yields,\nthis encourages more investments in U.S. ﬁnancial instruments, hence beneﬁting\nthe U.S. dollar. When the United States has the lowest yields, this discourages\ninvestments. Investors can also use short-term yields, such as the spreads on 2-year\ngovernment bonds, to gauge the short-term ﬂow of international funds. Aside from\ngovernment bond yields, Fed fund futures can also be used to estimate movement\nof U.S. funds, as they price in the expectation of future Fed interest rate policy.\nEuribor futures are a barometer for the Euro region’s expected future interest rates\nand can give an indication of EU future policy movements. We will discuss how to\nuse ﬁxed-income products to trade FX further in our strategy section.\nTrade Flows: Measuring Exports versus Imports\nTrade ﬂows are the basis of all international transactions. Just as the investment\nenvironment of a given economy is a key driver of its currency valuation, trade ﬂows\nrepresent a country’s net trade balance. Countries that are net exporters—meaning\nthey sell more goods abroad than they buy—will experience a net trade surplus.\nCountries that are net exporters are more likely to have their currency rise in value\nbecause from the perspective of international trade, their currency is being bought\nmore than it is sold. This impacts currency ﬂows because international clients buying\nthe exported product/service must ﬁrst buy the currency of the exporting nation.\nCountries who are net importers purchase more goods abroad than they sell,\ncreating a trade deﬁcit. These nations will generally see more downward than\nupward pressure on their currencies because in order to purchase these foreign\ngoods, importers must sell their own currency and purchase the currency of the\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?36country from which they are buying the good or service. This accordingly drives\ndown the value of the currency when all else is equal. This concept is important\nbecause it is one of primary reasons why many economists say that certain currencies\nneed to fall to reverse burgeoning trade deﬁcits.\nTo understand this further, let’s imagine that the UK economy is booming,\nand its stock market is performing well. Meanwhile, in the United States, a\nlackluster economy is creating a shortage of investment opportunities. In this type\nof environment U.S. investors will feel more inclined to sell their U.S. dollars and\nbuy British pounds to participate in the outperformance of the UK economy. When\nthey elect to do so, it results in the outﬂow of capital from the United States and\nthe inﬂow of capital into the United Kingdom. From an exchange rate perspective,\nthis would induce a fall in the USD coupled with a rise in the GBP, as demand for\nUSD declines and the demand for GBP increases, translating into strength for the\nGBP/USD currency pair.\nEven day and swing traders will ﬁnd it valuable to keep up with incoming\neconomic reports from the major economies.\nTrading Tip: Charting Economic Surprises\nOne way for traders to stay on top of economic trends is to chart economic data\nsurprises against price action. Figure 3.2 illustrates how this can be done. The chart\ngraphs how much an economic indicator has deviated from its consensus forecast,\nor the ‘‘surprise,’’ and stacks them on the same side and graphs price (blue line)\naction when the data was release against the surprise, with a simple regression line\n(white line). This can be done for all of the major currency pairs and provides a\nvisual guide to understanding whether price action has been in line with economic\nfundamentals and can be used as a guide to future price action. Economic data can\nbe found on the calendars of any major forex website, and price action can generally\nbe downloaded from your trading platforms.\nAccording to Figure 3.2, in November of 2004, there were 14 out of 15 positive\neconomic surprises and yet the dollar sold off against the euro during the month\nof December, which was the month in which the economic data were released.\nAlthough this methodology is not exact, the analysis is simple and past charts\nhave yielded some extremely useful clues to future price action. Figure 3.3 shows\nhow the EURUSD moved the following month. As you can see, the EURUSD\nquickly corrected itself during the month of January, indicating that the fundamental\ndivergence from price action that occurred in December proved to be quite useful\nto dollar longs, which harvested almost 600 pips as the euro quickly retracted a large\npart of its gains in January. This method of analysis, called variant perception, was ﬁrst\ninvented by the legendary hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, who produced\n24% average rates return for 30 consecutive years.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?37US Dollar Data and EURUSD\n1 .3700\n1 .3600\n1 .3500\n1 .3400\n1 .3300\n1 .3200\n1. 3 10 0\n1 .3000\n–100%–26.11%0.00%0.00%1.41%1.46%2.56%2.81%3.55%4.18%14.29%16.67%33.33%43.48%50.25%140.00%\n–50% 0% 50%Durable Goods\nEmpire State Manufacturing\nPhilly Fed\nLeading Economic Indicators\nPersonal Income\nIndustrial Production\nISM Non-Manufacturing\nCurrent Account\nExisting Home Sales\nGDP Annualized\nU.

Large positive and negative\nsurprises in economic data can often yield clues to future price action. If you go back\nand look at the EURUSD charts, you will see that the record current account deﬁcits\nin October 2004 were the catalyst that sent the dollar plunging over the next two\nmonths. In many ways, economic fundamentals matter more in the foreign exchange\nmarket than in any other market, and charts such as these could provide valuable\nclues to price direction. Generally, the 15 most important economic indices are\nchosen from each region, and then a price regression line is superimposed over the\npast 20 days of price data.\n■Technical Analysis\nPrior to the mid-1980s, fundamental traders dominated the FX market. However,\nwith the rising popularity of technical analysis and the advent of new technologies,\nthe inﬂuence of technical trading on the FX market has increased signiﬁcantly. The\navailability of high leverage also led to an increased number of high frequency and\nmomentum. They have become active participants in the FX market, with the acute\nability to inﬂuence currency prices.\nUnlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses on the study of price\nmovements. Technical analysts use historical currency data to forecast the direction\nof future prices. The underlying belief behind technical analysis is that all current\nmarket information is already reﬂected in the price of that currency; therefore,\nstudying price action is all that is required to make informed trading decisions. In a\nnutshell, technical analysis assumes that history will repeat itself.\nTechnical analysis is an extremely popular tool used by short- and medium-term\ntraders for analyzing the forex market. It works especially well in the currency\nmarkets because short-term currency price ﬂuctuations are primarily driven by\nhuman emotions or market perceptions. The primary tool in technical analysis\nis price and charts. Traders will look for trends and patterns to identify trading\nopportunities. The most basic concept of technical analysis is that markets have a\ntendency to trend. Being able to identify trends in their earliest stage of development\nis the key to technical analysis. Range trading is also very popular, and similar tools\ncan be used to identify these setups. Technical analysis integrates price action and\nmomentum to construct a pictorial representation of past currency price action and\nto use this information to predict future performance. Technical analysis tools such\nas Fibonacci retracement levels, moving averages, oscillators, candlestick charts, and\nBollinger bands provide further information on the value of the emotional extremes\nof buyers and sellers. It also helps to gauge when greed and fear are the strongest.\nThere are basically two types of markets, trending or range bound, and in the trade\nparameters section, we outline some rules that can help traders determine the type\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?39of market they trading in right now and the sort of trading opportunities they should\nbe looking for.\nIs Technical Analysis or Fundamental Analysis Better?\nNo one will ever win the age-long battle between technical and fundamental analysis.\nHowever, most individual traders will start trading with technical analysis because\nit is easier to understand and does not require hours of study. Technical analysts can\nalso follow many currencies and markets at one time, whereas fundamental analysts\ntend to focus on a few pairs due to the overwhelming amount of data in the market.\nNonetheless, technical analysis works well because the currency market tends to\ndevelop strong trends. Once technical analysis is mastered, it can be applied with\nequal ease to any time frame or currency traded.\nHowever, it is important to take both strategies into consideration, as fundamental\nanalysis can trigger technical movements such as breakouts or reversal in trends.\nTechnical analysis, on the other hand, can also explain moves that fundamentals\ncannot, especially in quiet markets, causing resistance in trends or unexplainable\nmovements. For example, as shown in Figure 3.4, in the days leading up to\nSeptember 11, USDJPY had just broken out of a triangle formation and looked\npoised to head higher. However, as the chart indicates, instead of breaking higher as\ntechnicians may have anticipated, USDJPY broke down following the September 11,\n2001, terrorist attacks and ended up hitting a low of 115.81 from a high of 121.88\non September 10.\n■Currency Forecasting—What Bookworms\nand Economists Look At\nFor more avid students of foreign exchange who want to learn more about\nfundamental analysis and valuing currencies, this section examines the different\nmodels of currency forecasting used by analysts of the major investment banks.\nThere are seven major models for forecasting currencies, which include the balance\nof payments theory, purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, the monetary\nmodel, the real interest rate differential model, the asset market model, and the\ncurrency substitution model.\nBalance of Payments Theory\nThe balance of payments theory states that exchange rates should be at their\nequilibrium level, which is the rate that produces a stable current account balance.\nCountries with trade deﬁcits experience a run on their foreign exchange reserves\ndue to the fact that exporters to that nation must sell that nation’s currency in order\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?k\nk40k\nk\nFIGURE 3.4 USDJPY September 11th Chart\nSource: eSignal\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?41to receive payment. The cheaper currency makes the nation’s exports less expensive\nabroad, which in turn fuels exports and brings the currency into balance.\nWhat Is the Balance of Payments (BOP)?\nThe balance of payments account is divided into two parts: the current account and\nthe capital account. The current account measures trade in tangible, visible items\nsuch as cars and manufactured goods; the trade balance is the surplus or deﬁcit\nbetween exports and imports. The capital account measures ﬂows of money, such\nas investments for stocks or bonds. Balance of payments data can be found on the\nwebsite of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nTrade Flows\nThe trade balance of a country shows the net difference over a period of time\nbetween a nation’s exports and imports. When a country imports more than it\nexports, the trade balance is negative or is in a deﬁcit. If the country exports more\nthan it imports, the trade balance is positive or is in a surplus. The trade balance\nreﬂects the redistribution of wealth among countries and is a major channel through\nwhich the macroeconomic policies of a country may affect another.\nIn general, if a country has a trade deﬁcit, it is considered to be unfavorable, since\nit negatively impacts the value of the nation’s currency. For example, if U.S. trade\nﬁgures show greater imports than exports, more dollars ﬂow out of the United\nStates and the value of the U.S. currency depreciates. A positive trade balance,\nin comparison, will affect the dollar by causing it to appreciate against the other\ncurrencies.\nCapital Flows\nIn addition to trade ﬂows, there are also capital ﬂows that occur among countries.\nThey record a nation’s incoming and outgoing investment ﬂows, such as payments\nfor entire or parts of companies, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, real estate, and\nfactories. Capital ﬂows are inﬂuenced by many factors, including the ﬁnancial and\neconomic climate of other countries, and can be in the form of physical or portfolio\ninvestments. In general, in developing countries, the composition of capital ﬂows\ntends to be skewed toward foreign direct investment (FDI) and bank loans. For\ndeveloped countries, due to the strength of the equity and ﬁxed-income markets,\nstocks and bonds appear to be more important than bank loans and FDI.\nEquity Markets\nEquity markets have a signiﬁcant impact on exchange rate movements because\nthey are a major place for high-volume currency movements. Their importance is\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?42considerable for the currencies of countries with developed capital markets, where\na great amount of capital inﬂows and outﬂows occur, and where foreign investors\nare major participants. The amount of the foreign investment ﬂows in the equity\nmarkets is dependent on the general health and growth of the market, reﬂecting\nthe well-being of companies and particular sectors. Movements of currencies occur\nwhen foreign investors move their money to a particular equity market. Thus,\nthey convert their capital in a domestic currency and push the demand for it\nhigher, making the currency appreciate. When the equity markets are experiencing\nrecessions, however, foreign investors tend to ﬂee, thus converting back to their\nhome currency and pushing the domestic currency down.\nFixed-Income (Bond) Markets\nThe effect that ﬁxed-income markets have on currencies is similar to that of the\nequity markets and is a result of capital movements. An investor’s interest in the\nﬁxed-income market depends on the company’s speciﬁcs and credit rating, as well as\non the general health of the economy and the country’s interest rates. The movement\nof foreign capital into and out of ﬁxed-income markets leads to change in the demand\nand supply for currencies, hence impacting the currencies’ exchange rates.\nSummary of Trade and Capital Flows\nDetermining and understanding a country’s balance of payments is perhaps the\nmost important and useful tool for those interested in fundamental analysis. Any\ninternational transaction gives rise to two offsetting entries: trade ﬂow balance\n(current account) and capital ﬂow balance (capital account). If the trade ﬂow balance\nis a negative outﬂow, the country is buying more from foreigners than it sells\n(imports exceed exports). When it is a positive inﬂow, the country is selling more\nthan it buys (exports exceed imports). The capital ﬂow balance is positive when\nforeign inﬂows of physical or portfolio investments into a country exceed that\ncountry’s outﬂows. A capital ﬂow is negative when a country buys more physical or\nportfolio investments than are sold to foreign investors.\nThese two entries, trade and capital ﬂow, when added together signify a country’s\nbalance of payments. In theory, the two entries should balance and add up to zero\nin order to provide for the maintenance of the status quo in a nation’s economy and\ncurrency rates.\nIn general, countries might experience positive or negative trade, as well as\npositive or negative capital ﬂow balances. In order to minimize the net effect of\nthe two on the exchange rates, a country should try to maintain a balance between\nthe two. For example, in the United States, there is a substantial trade deﬁcit, as\nmore is imported than is exported. When the trade balance is negative, the country\nis buying more from foreigners than it sells, and therefore it needs to ﬁnance its\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?43deﬁcit. This negative trade ﬂow might be offset by a positive capital ﬂow into the\ncountry, as foreigners buy either physical or portfolio investments. Therefore, the\nUnited States seeks to minimize its trade deﬁcit and maximize its capital inﬂows,\nwith hopes that the two will balance out.\nA change in this balance is extremely signiﬁcant and carries ramiﬁcations that\nrun deep into economic policy and currency exchange levels. The net result of the\ndifference between the trade and capital ﬂows, positive or negative, will impact the\ndirection in which the nation’s currency will move. If the overall trade and capital\nbalance is negative, it will result in a depreciation of the nation’s currency, and if\npositive, it will lead to an appreciation of the currency.\nClearly, a change in the balance of payments carries a direct effect for currency\nlevels. It is therefore possible for any investor to observe economic data relating to\nthis balance and interpret the results that will occur. Data relating to capital and\ntrade ﬂows should be followed most closely. For instance, if an analyst observes\nan increase in the U.S. trade deﬁcit and a decrease in the capital ﬂows, a balance\nof payments deﬁcit would occur, and as a result, an investor may anticipate a\ndepreciation of the dollar.\nLimitations of BOP Model\nThe BOP model mainly focuses on traded goods and services, while ignoring\ninternational capital ﬂows. Indeed, international capital ﬂows often dwarfed trade\nﬂows in the currency markets toward the end of the 1990s, and this oftentimes\nbalanced out the current account of debtor nations like the United States.\nFor example, in 1999, 2000, and 2001, the United States maintained a large\ncurrent account deﬁcit while the Japanese ran a large current account surplus.\nHowever, during this same period in time the U.S. dollar rose against the yen even\nthough trade ﬂows were running against the dollar. The reason was that capital ﬂows\nbalanced out trade ﬂows, thus defying the BOP’s forecasting model for a period of\ntime. Indeed, the increase in capital ﬂows has given rise to the asset market model .\nNote: It is probably a misnomer to call this theory the balance of payments theory\nsince it only takes into account the current account balance, not the actual balance\nof payments. However, until the 1990s capital ﬂows played a very small role in the\nworld economy, so the main statistic viewed was the trade balance, which made up\nthe bulk of the balance of payments for most nations.\nPurchasing Power Parity\nThepurchasing power parity (PPP) theory is based on the belief that foreign exchange\nrates should be determined by the relative prices of a similar basket of goods between\ntwo countries. Any change in a nation’s inﬂation rate should be balanced by an\nopposite change in that nation’s exchange rate. Therefore, according to this theory,\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?44when a country’s prices are rising due to inﬂation, that country’s exchange rate\nshould depreciate in order to return to parity.\nPPP’s Basket of Goods\nThe basket of goods and services priced for the PPP exercise is a sample of all goods\nand services covered by GDP. It includes consumer goods and services, government\nservices, equipment goods, and construction projects. More speciﬁcally, consumer\nitems include food, beverages, tobacco, clothing, footwear, rents, water supply,\ngas, electricity, medical goods and services, furniture and furnishings, household\nappliances, personal transport equipment, fuel, transport services, recreational\nequipment, recreational and cultural services, telephone services, education services,\ngoods and services for personal care and household operation, and repair and\nmaintenance services.\nBig Mac Index\nOne of the most well-known examples of PPP is The Economist ’s Big Mac Index. The\nBig Mac PPP calculates the exchange rate that would leave hamburgers costing the\nsame in America as elsewhere. Comparing these with actual rates helps to signal if\na currency is under- or overvalued. As described by The Economist, the index is a\nlightheartedly guide to currency valuation. It was never intended as a precise gauge\nof currency misalignment, but merely a tool to make exchange-rate theory more\ndigestible.\nFor example, in January 2015, the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and\nChinese yuan was approximately 6.20. At the time, a Big Mac cost $4.79 in the\nUnited States. In China, the same burger cost 17.15 yuan, or approximately $2.77\nat market exchange. This means that based on the comparison between the two\nburger prices, the Chinese yuan was undervalued by 42%.\nOECD Purchasing Power Parity Index\nThe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) releases a\nmore formal index. Under a joint OECD-Eurostat PPP Program, the OECD and\nEurostat share the responsibility for calculating PPPs. Their latest information on\nwhich currencies are under- or overvalued against the U.S. dollar can be found\non the OECD website at www.oecd.org. The OECD publishes a table that shows\nthe price levels for the major industrialized countries. Each column shows the\nnumber of speciﬁed monetary units needed in each of the countries listed to buy\nthe same representative basket of consumer goods and services. In each case,\nthe representative basket costs a hundred units in the country whose currency is\nspeciﬁed. The chart that is then created compares the PPP of a currency with its\nactual exchange rate. The chart is updated weekly to reﬂect the current exchange\nrate. It is also updated about twice a year to reﬂect new estimates of PPP. The\nPPP estimates are taken from studies carried out by the OECD; however, it should\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?45not be taken as deﬁnitive. Different methods of calculation will arrive at different\nPPP rates.\nAccording to the OECD’s data as of April 17, 2015, the PPP value of the\nAustralian dollar versus the U.S. dollar based on GDP is 0.6712. At the time, the\nAUD/USD exchange rate was 0.7812. Using this model of valuation, this indicates\nthat the Australian dollar was 14% overvalued.\nLimitations to Using Purchasing Power Parity\nPPP theory should only be used for long-term fundamental analysis. While the\neconomic forces behind PPP will eventually equalize the purchasing power of\ncurrencies, this can take many years. A time horizon of 5–10 years is typical.\nPPP’s major weakness is that it assumes goods can be traded easily, without regard\nto such things as tariffs, quotas, or taxes. For example, when the U.S. government\nannounces new tariffs on imported steel, the cost of domestic manufactured goods\ngoes up; but those increases will not be reﬂected in the U.S. PPP tables.\nThere are other factors that must also be considered when weighing PPP: inﬂation,\ninterest rate differentials, economic releases/reports, asset markets, trade ﬂows,\nand political developments. Indeed, PPP is just one of several theories traders should\nuse when determining exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Parity\nThe interest rate parity theory states that if two different currencies have different\ninterest rates, then that difference should be reﬂected in the premium or discount\nfor the forward exchange rate to prevent riskless arbitrage.\nFor example, if U.S. interest rates are 3% and Japanese interest rates are 1%,\nthen the U.S. dollar should depreciate against the Japanese yen by 2% in order\nto prevent riskless arbitrage. This future exchange rate is reﬂected in the forward\nexchange rate stated today. In our example, the forward exchange rate of the dollar\nis said to be at discount because it buys fewer Japanese yen in the forward rate than\nit does in the spot rate. The yen is said to be at a premium.\nInterest rate parity has shown very little proof of effectiveness in recent years.\nOftentimes, currencies with higher interest rates rise and attract incoming invest-\nment, while currencies with low and falling interest rates decline as outﬂows slow.\nThe Monetary Model\nAccording to the monetary model, exchange rates are determined by a nation’s\nmonetary policy. The premise is that countries that follow a stable monetary policy\nover time should have appreciating currencies. Countries that have erratic monetary\npolicies or excessively expansionist policies should see the value of their currency\ndepreciate.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?46How to Use the Monetary Model\nThree factors inﬂuence exchange rates under this theory:\n1. A nation’s money supply\n2. Expected future levels of a nation’s money supply\n3. The growth rate of a nation’s money supply\nAll of these factors are key to understanding and spotting a monetary trend that\nmay force a change in exchange rates. For example, let’s assume that the Japanese\neconomy has been slipping in and out of recession for over a decade. Interest rates\nare near zero and annual budget deﬁcits prevent the Japanese from spending their\nway out of recession, which leaves only one tool left at the disposal of Japanese\nofﬁcials determined to revive Japan’s economy: printing more money. By buying\nstocks and bonds, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is increasing the nation’s money supply,\nwhich produces inﬂation, and this forces a change in the exchange rate. The example\nin Figure 3.5 illustrates the effect of money supply changes to the Japanese yen using\nthe monetary model.\nIndeed, it is in the area of excessive expansionary monetary policy that the\nmonetary model is most successful. One of the only ways a country can keep\nits currency from sharply devaluing is by pursuing a tight monetary policy. For\nexample, during the Asian Currency Crisis, the Hong Kong dollar came under\nattack from speculators. Hong Kong ofﬁcials raised interest rates to 300% to halt\nthe Hong Kong dollar from being dislodged from its peg to the U.S. dollar. The\ntactic worked perfectly, as speculators were cleared out by such sky-high interest\nrates. The downside was that the Hong Kong economy would slide into recession.\nBut in the end, the peg held and the monetary model worked.\nLimitations of the Monetary Model\nVery few economists rely solely on this model because it does not take into account\ntrade ﬂows and capital ﬂows. For example, throughout 2014 Australia had higher\ninterest rates, growth rates, and inﬂation rates than both the United States and the\nEuropean Union, yet, the AUD appreciated in value against both the dollar and the\neuro. Indeed, the monetary model has greatly struggled since the dawn of freely\nCHANGE IN MONEY\nSUPPL Y\nY en Is Printed Increase in Y en Creates\nInflationY en Depreciates in ValueCHANGE IN EXCHANGE\nRATECHANGE IN PRICE\nLEVEL\nFIGURE 3.5 Monetary Model\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?47ﬂoating currencies. The model holds that high interest rates signal growing inﬂation,\nwhich it often does, followed by a depreciating currency. But this does not take into\naccount the capital inﬂows that would take effect as a result of higher interest yields\nor of an equity market that may be thriving in a booming economy—thus causing\nthe currency to possibly appreciate.\nIn any case, the monetary model is one of several valuation tools that can be\nemployed in tandem with other models to determine the direction an exchange rate\nis heading.\nReal Interest Rate Differential Model\nAccording to the real interest rate differential theory, exchange rate movements are\ndetermined by a country’s interest rate. The idea is that countries with high interest\nrates should see their currency appreciate in value, while countries with low interest\nrates should see their currency depreciate in value.\nBasics of the Model\nThe basic premise of the model is that when a country raises its interest rates,\ninternational investors will buy that currency because they ﬁnd its yield more\nattractive. When a country lowers interest rates, they sell the currency. Figure 3.6\nUK\nUKInterest Rates vs. United States Eurozone\nEurozone2003 Percent.

The Australian dollar had the\nlargest basis point spread and also had the highest return against the U.S. dollar,\nwhich seems to vindicate the model, as investors bought up higher-yielding Aussie.\nThe same can be said for the New Zealand dollar, which also had a higher yield\nthan the U.S. dollar and gained 27% against USD. Yet the model becomes less\nconvincing when comparing the euro, which gained 20% against the dollar (more\nthan every currency except NZD), even though its basis point differential was\nonly 100 points. The model then comes under serious question when comparing\nthe British pound and the Japanese yen. The yen differential is –100, and yet it\nappreciated almost 12% against the dollar. Meanwhile, the British pound gained\nonly 11% against the dollar even though it had a whopping 275 point interest rate\ndifferential.\nThis model also stresses that one of the key factors in determining the severity of\nan exchange rate’s response to a shift in interest rates is the expected persistence of\nthat shift. Simply put, a rise in interest rates that is expected to last for ﬁve years\nwill have a much larger impact on the exchange rate than if that rise were expected\nto last for only one year.\nLimitations to the Interest Rate Model\nThere is a great deal of debate among international economists over whether there\nis a strong and statistically signiﬁcant link between changes in a nation’s interest rate\nand currency price. The main weakness of this model is that it does not take into\naccount a nation’s current account balance, relying on capital ﬂows instead. Indeed,\nthe model tends to overemphasize capital ﬂows at the expense of numerous other\nfactors, such as political stability, inﬂation, and poor economic growth. Absent these\ntypes of factors, the model can be very useful, since it is quite logical to conclude\nthat an investor will naturally gravitate toward the investment vehicle that pays a\nhigher reward.\nThe Asset Market Model\nThe basic premise of the asset market model theory is that the ﬂow of funds into the\nﬁnancial assets of a country such as equities and bonds increases the demand for that\ncountry’s currency (and vice versa). As proof, advocates point out that the amount\nof funds that are placed in investment products such as stocks and bonds now dwarf\nthe amount of funds that is exchanged as a result of the transactions in goods and\nservices for import and export purposes. The asset market theory is basically the\nopposite of the balance of payments theory since it takes into account a nation’s\ncapital account instead of its current account.\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?49A Dollar-Driven Theory\nThroughout 1999, many experts argued that the dollar would fall against the euro\non the grounds of the expanding U.S. current account deﬁcit and an overvalued\nWall Street. That was based on the rationale that non-U.S. investors would begin\nwithdrawing their funds from U.S. stocks and bonds into more economically sound\nmarkets, which would weigh signiﬁcantly on the dollar. Yet, such fears have lingered\nsince the early 1980s when the U.S. current account soared to a record high 3.5%\nof GDP.\nIn the two decades that followed, the balance of payments approach in assessing\nthe dollar’s behavior has given way to the asset market approach. This theory\ncontinues to hold the most sway over pundits due to the enormity of U.S. capital\nmarkets. In May and June of 2002, the dollar plummeted over 1000 points versus\nthe yen at the same time equity investors ﬂed U.S. equity markets due to the\naccounting scandals that were plaguing Wall Street. As the scandals subsided toward\nthe end of 2002, the dollar rose 500 points from a low of 115.43 to close at 120.00\nagainst the yen, even though the current account balance remained in massive deﬁcit\nthe entire time.\nLimitations to the Asset Market Theory\nIt is frequently argued that over the long run, there is no relationship between\na nation’s equity market performance and the performance of its currency. See\nFigure 3.7 for a comparison. Between April 2014 and April 2015, the German DAX\nand EURUSD have a very weak correlation.\nAlso, what happens to a nation’s currency when the stock market is trading\nsideways—stuck between bullish and bearish sentiments? That was the scenario in\n6/11/14 7/11/14 8/11/14 9/11/1410/11/14 11/11/14 12/11/141/11/15 2/11/15 3/11/15 4/11/15 5/11/15 6/11/15EURUSD and DAX\n13000\n12500\n12000\n11500\n11000\n10500\n10000\n9500\n9000\n80001.4\n1.35\n1.3\n1.2\n11.051.11.151.25\n8500\nEURUSD BGN Curncy (R1) DAX  INDEX (R2)\nFIGURE 3.7 The DAX Index and the EURUSD\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?50Germany for much of 2014, and currency traders found themselves going back to\nolder money making models, such as interest rate arbitrage, as a result. Only time\nwill tell whether the asset market model will hold up or merely be a short-term blip\non the currency forecasting radar.\nThe Currency Substitution Model\nThe currency substitution model is an enhanced version of the monetary model\nbecause it takes into account investor ﬂows. It posits that the shifting of private\nand public portfolios from one nation to another can have a signiﬁcant effect on\nexchange rates. The ability of individuals to change their assets from domestic and\nforeign currencies is known as currency substitution. When this model is added\nto the monetary model, evidence shows that shifts in expectations of a nation’s\nmoney supply can have a decided impact on that nation’s exchange rates. Simply\nput, investors are looking at monetary model data and coming to the conclusion\nthat a change in money ﬂow is about to occur, thus affecting the exchange rate, so\nthey are investing accordingly, which turns the monetary model into a self-fulﬁlling\nprophecy. Investors who subscribe to this theory are merely jumping on the currency\nsubstitution model bandwagon on the way to the monetary model party.\nThe Yen Example\nIn the monetary model we talked about how the Japanese government was basically\nprinting yen and increasing the money supply when it bought stocks and bonds.\nMonetary model theorists would say that this monetary growth would spark inﬂation\n(more yen chasing fewer products), decrease demand for the yen, and ﬁnally cause\nthe yen to depreciate. A currency substitution theorist would agree with this scenario\nand look to take advantage of this view by shorting the yen, or if they were long\nthe yen promptly getting out of the position. By taking this action, our yen trader\nis helping to drive the market precisely in that direction, thus making the monetary\nmodel theory a fate accompli. The step-by-step process is illustrated in Figure 3.8.\nA. Japan announces new stock and bond buyback plan. Economists are now\npredicting Japan’s money supply will dramatically increase.\nB. Economists are also predicting a rise in inﬂation with the introduction of this\nnew policy. Speculators expect a change in the exchange rate as a result.\nC. Economists expect interest rates to rise and inﬂation takes hold in the economy.\nSpeculators start selling short the yen in anticipation of a change in the exchange\nrate.\nD. Demand for the yen plummets as money ﬂows easily through the Japanese\neconomy and speculators dump yen in the markets.\nE. The exchange rate for the Japanese yen changes dramatically as the yen falls\nin value to foreign currencies, especially those that are easily substituted by\ninvestors (read: liquid yen crosses).\nWHAT MOVES THE CURRENCY MARKET?51Forecast of\nFuture\nMonetary\nGrowth Forecast of\nFuture InflationChange in\nExchange RateChange in Real\nMoney Demand\nChange in\nExpected\nExchange RateChange in\nDemand for\nForeign Cash\nAB CD EForecast of\nFuture Inflation\nFIGURE 3.8 Currency Substitution Model\nLimitations of the Currency Substitution Model\nAmong the major, actively traded currencies, this model has not yet shown itself\nto be a convincing, single determinant for exchange rate movements. While this\ntheory can be used with more conﬁdence in underdeveloped countries where ‘‘hot\nmoney’’ rushes in and out of emerging markets with enormous effect, there are\nstill too many variables not accounted for by the currency substitution model. For\nexample, using the yen illustration in Figure 3.8, even though Japan may try to spark\ninﬂation with its securities’ buyback plan, it still has an enormous current account\nsurplus that will continually prop up the yen. Also, Japan has numerous political\nlandmines it must avoid in its own neighborhood, and should Japan make it clear\nthat it is trying to devalue its currency, there will be enormous repercussions. These\nare just two of many factors the substitution model does not take into consideration.\nHowever, this model (like numerous other currency models) should be considered\npart of an overall, balanced, FX forecasting diet."

        "67CHAPTER 6\nWhat Are Currency\nCorrelations, and\nHow Can We Use\nThem?\nWhen it comes to forex, one of the most important things to know is that\ncurrencies do not trade in a vacuum. In many cases, foreign economic\nconditions, interest rates, and price changes affect much more than just a single\ncurrency pair. Everything is interrelated in the forex market to some extent and\nknowing the direction and how strong this relationship is can be an advantage; it\nhas the potential to be a great trading tool. The bottom line is that unless you only\nwant to trade one pair at a time, it can be very proﬁtable to take into account\nhow pairs move relative to one another. To do this, we use correlation analysis.\nCorrelations are calculations based on pricing data, and these numbers can help\ngauge the relationships that exist between different currency pairs. The information\nthat the numbers provide can be a good aid for any traders who want to diversify\ntheir portfolio, double up on positions without investing in the same currency pair,\nor just get an idea of how much risk their trades are opening them up to. If used\ncorrectly, this method has the potential to maximize gains, gauge exposure, and\nhelp prevent counterproductive trading.\nWHAT ARE CURRENCY CORRELATIONS, AND HOW CAN WE USE THEM?68■Positive/Negative Correlations—What They Mean\nand How to Use Them\nKnowing how closely correlated the currency pairs are in your portfolio is a great\nway to measure your exposure and risk. You might think that you’re diversifying\nyour portfolio by investing in different pairs, but many of them have a tendency to\nmove in the same or opposite dir ection from one another. The correlations between\npairs can be strong or weak and last for weeks, months, or even years. Basically,\nwhat a correlation number measures is an estimate of how often these pairs move\ntogether or how opposite their actions are over a speciﬁed period of time. Any\ncorrelation calculation will be in decimal form; the closer the number is to 1, the\nstronger the connection between the two cu rrencies. For example, by looking at\nthe sample data in Table 6.1, we can see a +0.94 correlation between the EURUSD\nand the NZDUSD over the last month. If you are not a fan of decimals, you can also\nthink of the number as a percentage by multiplying it by 100% (in this case, getting\na 94% correlation between the EURUSD and the NZDUSD). High decimals reﬂect\ncurrency pairs that closely mirror one another, while lower numbers tell us that the\npairs do not usually move in a parallel fashion. Therefore, because there is a high\ncorrelation in this particular pair, we can see that by investing in both the EURUSD\nand the NZDUSD at the same time, you are virtually doubling up on a position.\nLikewise, it might not be the best idea to go long one of the pairs and short the\nother because a rally in one has a high likelihood of also setting off a rally in the\nother currency pair. While this would not make your proﬁt and losses exactly zero\nbecause they have different pip values, the two do move in such a similar fashion\nthat taking opposing positions could take a bite out of proﬁts or even cause losses.\nPositive correlations aren’t the only way to measure similarities between pairings;\nnegative correlations can be just as useful. In this case, instead of a very positive\nnumber, we are looking for a highly negative one. The closer the number is to\n–1, the increasingly connected the two currencies movements are, but this time in\nthe opposite direction. Again, we can use the EURUSD as an example. While we\njust saw a strong positive correlation with the NZDUSD, the EURUSD has a very\nnegative relationship with the USDCHF. Between these two currency pairs, the\ncorrelation has been –0.98 over the last year and –0.99 over the past month. This\nnumber indicates that these two pairs have a strong propensity to move in opposite\ndirections. Therefore, buying both currency pairs at the same time will often lead\nto gains in one and losses in the other. Buying one pair and selling the other would\nbe an intensiﬁcation of risk that can be v iewed as doubling up on t he same or similar\nposition.\nWHAT ARE CURRENCY CORRELATIONS, AND HOW CAN WE USE THEM?69Important Fact about Correlations: They Change\nAnyone who has ever traded the FX market knows that currencies are very dynamic;\neconomic conditions, both sentiment and pricing, change every day. Because of this,\nthe most important aspect to remember when analyzing currency correlations is\nthat they can also change overtime. The str ong correlations that are calculated today\nmight not be the same this time next year, or even next month. Due to the constant\nreshaping of the forex environment, it is imperative to keep current if you decide\nto use this method for trading. For example, over a one-month period that we\nobserved, the correlation between USDCAD and USDJPY was 0.06. This is a very\nlow number and would indicate that the pairs do not really share any deﬁnitive trend\nin their movements. However, if we look at the three-month data for the same time\nperiod, the number increases to 0.12 and then to 0.59 for six months, and ﬁnally\nto 0.80 for a year. In this particular example, we can see that there was a recent\nbreakdown in the relationship between these two pairs. What was once a strongly\npositive association over time has deteriorated completely in the short term. On\nthe other hand, the correlation between USDCHF and AUDUSD strengthened in\nmore recent reports. The correlation between these two pairs started at –0.78 for\nthe year and edged up to –0.94 for the last month. This suggests that there is an\nincreasing probability that if one of the trades became proﬁtable, the other would as\nwell. The opposite is also true that if one of the trades incurs signiﬁcant losses, the\nother has a very high likelihood of also ending up unproﬁtable.\nAn even more dramatic example of the extent to which these numbers can change\ncan be found in the GBPUSD and AUDUSD pai rs; there was a –0.79 correlation\nbetween the two for the yearlong data. However, while these two tended to move\nin reasonably opposite directions in the long term, over the month of February\n2005, for example, they were positively correlated with a +0.76 reading. The\nmajor events that change the amount and even direction that pairs are correlated are\nusually associated with major economic developments, such as interest rate changes\nor quantitative easing.\nCalculating Correlations Yourself\nBecause correlations have the tendency to shift overtime and the data in the table\ncould be stale by the time you read it, the best way to keep current on the direction\nand strength of your pairings is to calculate them yourself. Although it might seem\nlike a tricky concept, the actual process can be made quite easy. The simplest way\nto calculate the numbers is to use Microsoft Excel. In Excel, you can take the\ncurrency pairs that you want to derive a correlation from over a speciﬁc time period\nWHAT ARE CURRENCY CORRELATIONS, AND HOW CAN WE USE THEM?70\nEURUSD AUDUSD USDJPY GBPUSD NZDUSD USDCHF USDCAD\n1 Month 0.94 −0.92 0.92 0.94 −0.99 −0.32\n3 Month 0.47 −0.37 0.83 0.57 −0.98 −0.61\n6 Month 0.74 −0.83 0.94 0.78 −0.96 −0.57\n1Y e a r 0 . 8 5 −0 86 0.91 0.93 −09 8 −0.89\nAUDUSD EURUSD USDJPY GBPUSD NZDUSD USDCHF USDCAD\n1 Month 0.94 −0.91 0.95 0.96 −09 4 −0.17\n3 Month 0.47 0.24 0.81 0.90 −04 4 −0.14\n6 Month 0.74 −0.70 0.75 0.89 −0.70 −0.54\n1Y e a r 0 . 8 5 −0.87 0.79 0.90 −0.78 −0.81\nUSDJPY EURUSD AUDUSD GBPUSD NZDUSD USDCHF USDCAD\n1 Month −0.92 −0.91 −0.88 −0.91 0.94 0.06\n3 Month −0.37 0.24 −0.08 0.15 0.40 0.12\n6 Month −0.83 −0.70 −0.75 −0.61 0.83 0.59\n1Y e a r −0.86 −0.87 −0.82 −0.84 0.83 0.80\nGBPUSD EURUSD AUDUSD USDJPY NZDUSD USDCHF USDCAD\n1 Month 0.92 0.95 −0.88 0.87 −0.95 −0.03\n3 Month 0.83 0.81 −0.08 0.83 −0.82 −0.36\n6 Month 0.94 0.75 −0.75 0.84 −0.88 −0.42\n1 Year 0.91 0.79 −0.82 0.82 −0.90 −0.70\nNZDUSD EURUSD AUDUSD USDJPY GBPUSD USDCHF USDCAD\n1 Month 0.94 0.96 −0.91 0.87 −0.92 −0.29\n3 Month 0.57 0.90 0.15 0.83 −0.53 −0.35\n6 Month 0.78 0.89 −0.61 0.84 −0.69 −0.38\n1 Year 0.93 0.90 −0.84 0.82 −0.88 −0.94\nUSDCHF EURUSD AUDUSD USDJPY GBPUSD NZDUSD USDCAD\n1 Month −0.99 −0.94 0.94 −0.95 −0.92 0.21\n3 Month −0.98 −04 4 0 . 4 0 −0.82 −0.53 0.55\n6 Month −0.96 −07 0 0 . 8 3 −0.88 −0.69 0.70\n1Y e a r −0.98 −07 8 0 . 8 3 −0.90 −0.88 0.87\nUSDCAD EURUSD AUDUSD USDJPY GBPUSD NZDUSD USDCHF\n1 Month −0.32 −0.17 0.06 −0.03 −0.29 0.21\n3 Month −0.61 −0.14 0.12 −0.36 −0.35 0.55\n6 Month −0.57 −0.54 0.59 −04 2 −0.38 0.70\n1Y e a r −0.89 −0.81 0.80 −07 0 −0.94 0.87\nDate EURUSD AUDUSD USDJPY GBPUSD NZDUSD USDCHF USDCAD\n03/29/2004 - 09/29/2004 6 Month Trailing 0.10 −0.28 0.69 0.68 −0.88 −0.60\n04/29/2004 - 10/28/2004 6 Month Trailing 0.77 −0.67 0.47 0.84 −0.90 −0.78\n05/31/2004 - 11/29/2004 6 Month Trailing 0.96 −0.88 0.61 0.88 −0.97 −0.89\n06/30/2004 - 12/29/2004 6 Month Trailing 0.93 −0.94 0.87 0.94 −0.98 −0.85\n07/30/2004 - 01/28/2005 6 Month Trailing 0.93 −0.93 0.92 0.95 −0.99 −0.86\n08/31/2004 - 03/01/2005 6 Month Trailing 0.88 −0.91 0.96 0.91 −0.98 −0.80\n09/30/2004 - 03/31/2005 6 Month Trailing 0.74 −0.83 0.95 0.79 −0.96 −0.58\nAverage 0.76 −0.78 0.78 0.86 −0.95 −0.77\nFIGURE 6.1 March Correlation Table\nWHAT ARE CURRENCY CORRELATIONS, AND HOW CAN WE USE THEM?71and just use the correlation function.

Highlight all of the data in one of the pricing columns, type in a\ncomma, and then do the same thing for the other currency; the number produced\nis your correlation. Although it is not necessary to update your numbers every day,\nupdating them every few weeks or at the ve ry least once a month is generally a\ngood idea.\nSample Correlations Results\nFigure 6.1 presents a sample of the output results."

        "73CHAPTER 7\nTrade Parameters\nfor Various Market\nConditions\nAfter learning about the emergence of the foreign exchange market, who the\nmajor players are, signiﬁcant historical milestones, and what moves the markets,\nit is time to move on and discuss some of my favorite strategies for trading currencies.\nHowever, before I even begin going over these strategies, the most important ﬁrst\nstep for any trader, regardless of the market that you are trading in, is to create a\ntrading journal.\n■Keep a Trading Journal\nThrough my experience, I have learned that being a successful trader is not about\nﬁnding the holy grail of indicators that can perfectly forecast movements 100% of\nthe time, but instead, to develop discipline. I cannot undermine the importance of\n‘‘the journal’’ as the primary ﬁrst step to becoming a successful and professional\ntrader. While working on the Inter-bank FX trading desk at J.P. Morgan and then\non the Cross-Markets trading desk after the merger with Chase, the trading journal\nmentality was engrained into the minds of every dealer and proprietary trader on the\ntrading ﬂoors, regardless of rank. The reason was simple—the bank was providing\nthe capital for trading and we needed to be held accountable, especially since each\ntransaction involved millions of dollars. For every trade that was executed, we\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS74needed to have a solid rationale as well as justiﬁcation for the choice of entry and exit\nlevels. More speciﬁcally, you had to know where to place your exit points before\nyou placed the trade to approximate worst case losses and to manage risk.\nWith this sort of accountability, the leading banks of the world are able to breed\nsuccessful and professional traders. For individual traders, this practice is even more\nimportant because you are trading with your own money and not someone else’s.\nBank traders are trading with someone else’s money so regardless of how poorly\nthey perform over a one- or two-week basis, they will receive their paycheck twice\na month. At a bank, traders have plenty of time to make the money back without any\ndisruptions to their daily way of life—unless of course they lose $1 million in one\nday. As an individual trader—you do not have this luxury. When you are trading\nwith your own money, each dollar lost is a dollar less that you own. So even though\nyou should only be trading with risk capital, or money that would not otherwise be\nused for rent or groceries, one way or the other, the pain is felt. To avoid repeating\nthe same mistakes and taking large losses, I cannot stress enough the importance of\nkeeping a trading journal. The journal is designed to ensure that as a trader, you\nonly take calculated losses and learn from each mistake. The trading journal setup\nthat I recommend should be broken up into three parts:\n1. Currency pair checklist\n2. Trades that I am waiting for\n3. Existing or completed trades\nCurrency Pair Checklist\nThe ﬁrst section of your trading journal should consist of a spreadsheet that can be\nprinted out and completed every day. This purpose of this checklist is to get a feel\nof the market and to identify trades. It should list of all of the currency pairs that are\noffered for trading on the left column, followed by three columns for the current,\nhigh, and low prices, and then a series of triggers laid out as a row on the right\nhand side. Newer traders should start with following only the four major currency\npairs, which are the EURUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, and the GBPUSD, and then\ngradually add the AUDUSD, USDCAD, and NZDUSD, followed by the nondollar\npairs. Although the checklist that I have created is fairly detailed, I ﬁnd that it is\na very useful daily exercise and should take no more than 20 minutes to complete\nonce the appropriate indicators are saved on the charts. The purpose of this checklist\nis to get a clear visual of which currencies are trending and which are range trading.\nComprehending the big picture is the ﬁrst step to trading successfully. Too often\nhave I seen traders fail because they lose sight of the overall environment that they\nare trading in. The worst thing to do is to trade blindly. Trying to pick tops or\nbottoms in a strong trend or buying breakouts in a range-bound environment can\nlead to signiﬁcant losses. Just take a look at Figure 7.1 of the EURUSD. If you tried\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS75\nFIGURE 7.1 EURUSD Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS76to pick bottoms in this pair, it would have led to an entire year of frustrating and\nunsuccessful trading. In trending environments, traders will ﬁnd a higher success\nrate by buying on retracements in an uptrend or selling on rallies in a downtrend.\nPicking tops and bottoms should only be a strategy that is used in clear range trading\nenvironments and even with that, traders need to be careful of contracting ranges\nthat can lead to breakout scenarios.\nA simpliﬁed version of the daily market overview sheet that I use is shown in\nFigure 7.2.\nAs you can see in Figure 7.2, the ﬁrst two columns after the daily high and low\nprices are the levels of the 10-day high or low. Recording this price helps to identify\nwhere current prices are within previous price action. This helps traders get a gauge\nof whether we are pressing toward a 10-day high or low or if we are simply trapped\nin the middle of the range. Yet the prices alone do not provide enough information\nto determine if we are in a trending or a range-bound environment. The next ﬁve\nindicators is a checklist for determining a trending environment. The more X marks\nin this section, the stronger the trend.\nThe ﬁrst column in the trending indicator group is the ‘‘ADX (14) above 25.’’\nADX is the Accumulation Distribution Index, which is the most popular used\nindicator for determining the strength of a trend. If the index reading is above 25,\nit indicates that a trend has developed. Generally speaking, the greater the number,\nthe stronger the trend. The next column is Bollinger Bands. When strong trends\ndevelop, the pair will frequently tag and cross either the upper or lower Bollinger\nBand. The next three trend indicators are the longer term moving averages. A\nbreak above or below these moving averages may also be indicative of a trending\nenvironment. With moving averages, crossovers in the direction of the trend can be\nused as a further conﬁrmation. If there are two or more Xs in this section, traders\nshould be looking for opportunities to buy on dips in an uptrend or sell on rallies in a\ndowntrend rather than selling at the top and buying back at the bottom of the range.\nThe last section of the trading journal is indications of range. The ﬁrst indicator is\nalso ADX, but this time, we are looking for ADX below 25, which signals that the\ncurrency pair’s trend is weak. Next, we look at the traditional oscillators, RSI and\nstochastics. If the ADX is weak and there is signiﬁcant technical resistance above,\nprovided by indicators such as moving averages or Fibonacci retracement levels,\nand RSI and/or stochastics are at overbought or oversold levels, we identify an\nenvironment that is highly conducive to range trading.\nOf course, the market overview sheet is not foolproof, and just because you have\na lot of X marks in either the trend or range group doesn’t mean that a trend will\nnot fade or a breakout will not occur. Yet, what this spreadsheet will do is prevent\ntraders from trading blindly and ignoring the broader market conditions. It provides\ntraders with a launching pad from which to identify the day’s trading opportunities.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS77Date - Time\nTrending Range\nCurrencyPair Current\nPriceDaily\nHighDaily\nLow10-day\nHigh10-day\nLowBollinger\nBand UpBollinger\nBand Down(14)\nabove 25Crosses\n50-DayCrosses\n100-dayCrosses\n200-dayBollinger\nBand\nRangeADX\n(14)\nbelow\n25RS1 (14)\nGreater\nthan 80(14)\nLess\nthan 80Stochastics\n>70Stochastics\n<30\nEURUSD 1.105 1.1144 1.0923 X X X X\nGBPUSD\nUSDJPY\nUSDCHF\nAUDUSD\nNZDUSD\nUSDCAD\nEURJPY\nEURGBP\nEURCHF\nAUDJPY\nCHFJPY\nGBPJPY\nGBPCHF\nAUDCAD\nEURCAD\nAUDNZD\nFIGURE 7.2 Currency Checklist\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS78Trades That I Am Waiting For\nThe next section in the trading journal lists out the possible trades for the day. Based\non an initial overview of the charts, this section is where you should list the trades\nfor which you are waiting. A sample entry would look like the following:\nApril 5, 2015\nBuy AUDUSD on a break of 0.7850 (previous day high)\nStop at 0.7800 (50-day SMA)\nTarget 1—0.7925 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement of Nov-Mar bull wave)\nTarget 2—0.8075 (Upper Bollinger)\nTarget 3—10-day Trailing Low\nAs soon as your entry level is reached, you know exactly how to take action and\nwhere to place your stops and limits. Of course, it is also important to take a quick\nglance at the market to make sure that the trading conditions that you were waiting\nfor are still intact. For example, if you were looking for a strong breakout with no\nretracement to occur at the entry level, when it does break, you want to make sure\nthat the break has decent momentum. This exercise will help you develop a plan of\naction to approach your trading day. Before every battle, warriors will regroup to\ngo over the plan of attack—in trading, you want to have the same mentality. Plan\nand prepare for the worst-case scenario and know your plan of attack for the day!\nExisting or Completed Trades\nThis section is developed and used to enforce discipline and to learn from your\nmistakes. At the end of each trading day, it is important to review this section to\nunderstand why certain trades resulted in losses and others in proﬁts. The purpose\nof this section is to identify trends. To understand why this is important, let’s look\nat an example that is completely unrelated to trading. On a normal given day,\nmost people will subconsciously inject a lot of ‘‘ums’’ or ‘‘uhs’’ into their daily\nconversation. However, most of these people do not even realize that they are even\ndoing so until someone records their conversation and replays it back to them. This\nis one of the ways that professional presenters and newscasters train to kick the\nhabit of using placeholder words. Having worked with over 65,000 traders, too\noften have I seen these traders make the same mistakes repeatedly. This includes\ntaking proﬁts too early, letting losses run, getting emotional about trading, ignoring\neconomic releases, or entering a trade prematurely. Keeping a record of previous\ntrades is like keeping a recording of your conversations. When you ﬂip back to the\ntrades that you have completed, you may have a perfect map of what strategies have\nor have not been proﬁtable for you. The reason why a journal is so important is\nbecause it minimizes the emotional intervention of trades. I frequently see novice\ntraders take proﬁts early but let losses run. The following are two samples of trade\njournal entries that could have provided learning opportunities:\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS79February 12, 2015\nTrade: Short 3 lots of EURUSD @ 1.1045\nStop: 1.1195 (former all-time high)\nTarget: 1.0800\nResult: Trade closed on Feb 13, 2015—stopped out of the 3 lots @ 1.1195\n(–150 pips)\nComments: Got margin call! It broke the all-time high, I thought it was going\nto reverse, did not stick to stop—kept letting losses run, eventually margin\ncall closed out all positions. Note to self: MAKE SURE STICK TO STOPS!\nApril 3, 2015\nTrade: Long 2 lots of USDCAD @ 1.2135\nStop: 1.2000 (strong technical support—conﬂuence of 50-day moving average\nand 68% Fibonacci retracement of Feb—March rally)\nTarget: First lot @ 1.2295 (upper Bollinger and 5 pips shy of 1.2300 psychological\nresistance)\nSecond lot @ 1.2450 (Former head and shoulders support turned resistance,\n100-day SMA)\nResult: Trade closed on April 5, 2015—stopped out of the 2 lots at 1.2000\n(–135 pips)\nComments: USDCAD did not continue uptrend and was becoming overbought,\nI didn’t see that ADX was weakening and falling from higher levels, there was\nalso a divergence in Stochastics. Note to self: MAKE SURE TO LOOK FOR\nDIVERGENCES NEXT TIME!\nUnlike many traders, the best trades in my opinion are the trades where both\ntechnicals and fundamentals support the trade. In general, I prefer to stay out of\ntrades that contradict my fundamental outlook. For example, if there is a bullish\nformation in both the GBPUSD and the AUDUSD due to U.S. dollar weakness,\nbut the Bank of England has ﬁnished raising interest rates, while the Reserve\nBank of Australia has full intentions of tightening to tame the strength of the\nAustralian economy, I would most likely choose to express my bearish dollar view\nin the AUDUSD rather than the GBPUSD. My bias for choosing the AUDUSD\nover the GBPUSD would be even stronger if the AUDUSD already offered a\nhigher interest rate differential than the GBPUSD. I seen technicals thwarted by\nfundamentals so often that now I always incorporate both into my trading strategy.\nI use a combination of technical, fundamental, and positioning, and am generally\nalso a trend follower. I also typically use a top-down approach that involves the\nfollowing:\n1. I will start by taking an overall technical survey of the market and pick the\ncurrency pairs that have retraced to attractive levels for entry in order to\nparticipate in a medium term fundamentally supportive trend.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS802. For currencies with a dollar component (i.e., not the crosses), I determine if my\ninitial technical view for that pair coincides with my fundamental view on the\ndollar, as well as my view on how upcoming U.S. releases may impact trading\nfor the day. The reason why I look at the dollar speciﬁcally is because 80% of all\ncurrency trades involve the dollar, which makes U.S. fundamentals particularly\nimportant.\n3. If it is a cross, I will proceed by determining if the technical view coincides with\nthe fundamental outlook using Fibonacci retracements, ADX, moving averages,\noscillators, and other technical tools.\n4. Then I like to look at positioning using the Commitment of Traders Report or\nthe FXCM Speculative Sentiment index to see if it supports the trade.\n5. If I am left with two equally compelling trade ideas, I will choose the one with\na positive interest rate differential.\nHave a Toolbox—Use What Works for the Current Market\nEnvironment\nOnce you have created a trading journal, it is time to ﬁgure out which indicators to\nlay on your charts. The reason why a lot of traders fail is because they neglect to\nrealize that their favorite indicators are not foolproof. Buying when stochastics are\nin oversold territory and selling when it is in overbought territory is a strategy that\nis used quite often by range traders, to a great deal of success, but once the market\nstops range trading and begins to trend, then relying on stochastics could lead to\ntremendous amount of losses. In order to become consistently proﬁtable, successful\ntraders need to learn to be adaptable.\nOne of the most important practices that every trader must understand is to be\nconscious of the environment that they are trading in. Every trader needs to have\nsome sort of checklist that will help to classify the trading environment so that\nthey can determine whether the market is trending or range bound. Deﬁning\ntrade parameters is one of the most important disciplines of trading. Too many\ntraders have tried to pick the top within a trend, only to wind up with consistently\nunproﬁtable trades.\nAlthough deﬁning trade parameters is important to traders in any market\n(currencies, futures, equities), it is particularly important in the currency market\nsince over 80% of the volume is speculative in nature. This means that currencies\ncan spend a very long period of time in a certain trading environment. Also, the\ncurrency market obeys technical analysis particularly well, given its large scale and\nnumber of participants.\nThere are basically two types of trading environments, which means that at any\npoint in time an instrument is either range trading or trending. The ﬁrst step every\ntrader needs to take is to deﬁne the current trading environment. The shortest time\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS81frame that traders should start looking at when their trading day starts are daily\ncharts, even if you are trading on a 5-minute time frame.\n■Step #1: Determine the Trading Environment\nRules to Determining Trading Environment\nThere are many different ways that traders can determine whether a currency pair\nis range trading or trending. Of course, many people do it visually, but having set\nrules will help to keep traders out of trends that may be fading or to prevent traders\nfrom getting into a range trade in the midst of a possible breakout. In Figure 7.3, I\nhave outlined some of the rules that I look for in order to classify a currency pair’s\ntrading environment.\nProﬁling a Range Environment\nLook for:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) less than 20 —The Average Directional Index is\none of the primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a\ntrend. When ADX is less than 20, this suggests that the trend is weak, which\nis generally characteristic of range-bound market. If ADX is less than 20 and\ntrending downward, it provides a further conﬁrmation that the trend is not only\nweak but will probably stay in a range-trading environment for a while longer.\n2.Decreasing implied volatility —There are many ways to analyze volatility. What I\nlike to do is actually track short-term versus long-term volatility. When short-\nterm volatility is falling, especially after a burst above long-term volatility, it\nis usually indicative of a reversion to range trading scenarios. Volatility usually\nTrade Rules Indicators\nRange ■ADX<20\n■Decreasing implied volatility\n■Risk reversals near choice or ﬂipping\nbetween favoring calls and putsBollinger, Bands, ADX,\nOptions\nTrend ■ADX>25\n■Momentum consistent with trend\ndirection\n■Risk reversals strongly bid for put or callMoving\naverages, ADX, Options,\nMomentum\nFIGURE 7.3 Trend/Range Trading Rules\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS82blows out when a currency pair experiences sharp, quick moves. It contracts\nwhen ranges are narrow and the trading is very quiet in the markets. The lazy\nman’s version of the way I track volatility is Bollinger Bands, which is actually\nalso a fairly decent measure for determining volatility conditions. A narrow\nBollinger Band suggests that ranges are small and there is low volatility in the\nmarkets, while wide Bollinger Bands are reﬂective of large ranges and a highly\nvolatile environment. In a range-trading environment, we are looking for fairly\nnarrow Bollinger Bands, ideally in a horizontal formation similar to the USDJPY\nchart in Figure 7.4.\n3.Risk reversals ﬂipping between calls and puts : A risk reversal consists of a pair of\noptions, a call and a put, on the same currency. Risk reversals have both the\nsame expiration (1 month) and sensitivity to the underlying spot rate. They are\nquoted in terms of the difference in volatility between the two options. While\nin theory these options should have the same implied volatility in practice, these\nvolatilities often differ in the market. Risk reversals can be seen as having a\nmarket polling function. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates\nthat the market prefers calls over puts. The reverse is true if the number is\nstrongly in favor of puts versus calls. Thus, risk reversals can be used as a\nsubstitute for gauging positions in the FX market. In an ideal environment, far\nout of the money calls and puts should have the same volatility. However, this\nis rarely the case, since there is generally a sentiment bias in the markets that\nis reﬂected in risk reversals. In range-bound environments, risk reversals tend\nFIGURE 7.4 USDJPY Bollinger Band Chart\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS83to ﬂip between favoring calls and puts at nearly zero (or equal). This indicates\nthat there is indecision among bulls and bears, and there is no strong bias in\nthe markets.\nWhat Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nAccording to the risk reversals in Figure 7.5, we can see that the market is strongly\nfavoring yen calls (JC) and dollar puts over the long term. EURUSD short-term\nrisk reversals are near choice, which is what you are looking for when proﬁling a\nrange-bound environment. Risk reversal information used to be readily available\nbut is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd these days. Currently, the only place we know of that\nprovides this information is the Bloomberg Professional Terminal, which costs over\nUS$1500 a month.\nIdentifying a Trending Environment\nLook for three things:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) greater than 20 —As mentioned earlier when we\ntalked about range-trading conditions, the Average Directional Index is one of\nthe primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a trend. In\na trending environment, we look for ADX to be greater than 25 and rising. If\nADX is greater than 25 but sloping downward, especially off of the extreme 40\nlevel, you have to be careful of aggressive trend positioning since it may indicate\nthat the trend is waning.\n2.Momentum consistent with trend direction —In addition to using ADX, I also\nrecommend looking for conﬁrmation of a trending environment through\nmomentum indicators. Traders should look for momentum to be consistent\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nCurrency 1M R/R 3M R/R 6M R/R 1YR R/R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 JC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C=Japanese yen call * SC =Sterling call\n*E C=Euro call * CC =Swiss call\n*S P=Sterling put\nFIGURE 7.5 Risk Reversals\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS84with the direction of the trend. Most currency traders will look for oscillators to\npoint strongly in the direction of the trend. For example, in an uptrend, trend\ntraders will look for the moving averages, RSI, stochastics, and MACD to all\npoint strongly upward. In a downtrend, they will look for these same indicators\nto point downward. Some currency traders use the momentum index, but in\nmy experience, it is less popular and reliable. Instead, one of the strongest\nmomentum indicators is a perfect order of moving averages. A perfect order is\nwhen we have the moving averages line up perfectly: that is, for an uptrend,\nthe 10-day SMA is greater than the 20-day SMA, which is greater 50-day SMA.\nThe 100-day SMA and the 200-day SMA are below the shorter-term moving\naverages. In a downtrend, a perfect order would be when the shorter-term\nmoving averages stack up below the longer-term moving averages.\n3.Options (risk reversals)— With a trending environment, we are looking for risk\nreversals to strongly favor calls or puts. When one side of the market is laden\nwith interest, it is usually indicative of a strong trending environment or that a\ncontra-trend move may be brewing if risk reversals are at extreme levels.\n■Step #2: Determine the Time Frame for Trade\nOnce you have determined that a currency pair is either range-bound or trending,\nit is time to determine how long you plan on holding the trade. The following is a\nset of guidelines and indicators that I use for trading different time frames. Not all\nof the guidelines need to be met, but the more guidelines that are met, the more\nsolid the trading opportunity.\nIntraday Trade (Range)\nRules:\n1. Use hourly charts to determine entry points and daily charts to conﬁrm that a\nrange trade exists on a longer-time frame.\n2. Use oscillators to determine entry point within range.\n3. Look for short-dated risk reversals to be near choice.\n4. Look for reversal in oscillators (RSI or stochastics at extreme point).\n5. Trade stronger when prices fail at key resistance or hold key support levels (use\nFibonacci retracement points and moving averages).\nIndicators Used:\nStochastics, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, options, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS85Medium-Term Range Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. There are two ways to range trade medium term—position for upcoming range\ntrading opportunities or get involved in existing ranges.\n3.Upcoming range opportunities : Look for high-volatility environments, where short-\nterm implied volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than longer-term volatilities.\nSeek reversion back to the mean environments.\n4.Existing ranges : Use Bollinger Bands to identify existing ranges.\n5. Look for reversals in oscillators such as RSI and stochastics.\n6. Make sure ADX is below 25 and ideally falling.\n7. Look for medium-term risk reversals near choice.\n8. Conﬁrm with price action—failure at key range resistances and bounces on key\nrange supports (using traditional technical indicators).\nIndicators:\nOptions, Bollinger Bands, stochastics, MACD, RSI, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nMedium-Term Trend Trade\nRules:\n1. Look for ranges on daily charts and use weekly charts for conﬁrmation.\n2. Refer back to the characteristics of a trending environment—look for those\nparameters to be met.\n3. Buy breakout/retracement scenarios on key Fibonacci levels or moving averages.\n4. Look for no major resistance levels in front of trade.\n5. Look for candlestick pattern conﬁrmation.\n6. Look for moving average conﬂuence to be on same side of trade.\n7. Enter on a break of signiﬁcant high or low.\n8. The ideal is to wait for volatilities to contract before getting in.\n9. Look for fundamentals to also be supportive of trade—growth and interest\nrates. You want to see a string of economic surprises or disappointments\ndepending on directional bias.\nIndicators\nADX, Parabolic SAR, RSI, Ichimoku Clouds, Elliot waves, Fibonacci\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS86Medium-Term Breakout Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. Look for contraction in short-term volatility to a point where it is sharply below\nlong-term volatility.\n3. Use pivot points to determine whether a break is a true break or a false break.\n4. Look for moving average conﬂuences to be supportive of trade.\nIndicators\nBollinger Bands, moving averages, Fibonacci\n■Risk Management\nAlthough risk management is one of the more simple topics to grasp, it is also one\nof the most important. Too often we have seen traders turn winning positions into\nlosing positions and solid strategies result in losses instead of proﬁts. The fact of the\nmatter is that regardless of how intelligent and knowledgeable a trader may be about\nthe markets, their own psychology will cause them to lose money. Why does this\nhappen? Are the markets really so enigmatic that few can proﬁt? Or is there simply\na common mistake that virtually all traders are prone to making? The answer is the\nlatter. And the good news is that the problem, while it can be an emotionally and\npsychologically challenging, is ultimately fairly easy to grasp and solve.\nMost traders lose money simply because they have no understanding or place no\nimportance in risk management . Risk management involves essentially knowing how\nmuch you are willing to risk and how much you are looking to gain. Without a\nsense of risk management, most traders simply hold on to losing positions for an\nextremely long amount of time, but take proﬁts on winning positions prematurely.\nThe result is a seemingly paradoxical scenario that in reality is all too common: The\ntrader ends up having more winning positions than losing ones, but ends up with a\nnegative P/L. So, what can traders do to ensure they have solid risk management\nhabits? There are a few key guidelines that every trader, regardless of their strategy\nor what they are trading, should keep in mind:\n■Risk-reward ratio . Traders should look to establish a risk-reward ratio for every\ntrade they place. In other words, they should have an idea of how much they are\nwilling to lose, and how much they are looking to gain. Generally, the risk-reward\nratio should be at least 1:2, if not more. Having a solid risk-reward ratio can\nprevent traders from entering positions that ultimately are not worth the risk.\n■Stop-loss orders . Traders should also employ stop-loss orders as a way of specifying\nthe maximum loss they are willing to accept. By using stop-loss orders, traders\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS87can avoid the common predicament of being in a scenario where they have many\nwinning trades but a single loss large enough to eliminate any trace of proﬁtability\nin the account. Trailing stops to lock in proﬁts are particularly useful. A good\nhabit of more successful traders is to employ the rule of moving your stop to\nbreak even as soon as your position has proﬁted by the same amount that you\ninitially risked through the stop order. At the same time, some traders may also\nchoose to close a portion of their position.\nFor those looking to add to a winning position or go with trend, the best strategy\nis to treat it as if it were a new trade of its own, independent of the winning position.\nIf you are going to add to a winning position, perform the same analysis of the chart\nthat you would if you had no position at all. If a trade continues to go in your favor,\nyou can also close out part of the position while trailing your stop higher on the\nremaining lots that you are holding. Try thinking about your risk and reward on\neach separate lot that you have bought if they are at different entry points as well. If\nyou buy a second lot 50 pips above your ﬁrst entry point, don’t use the same stop\nprice on both, but manage the risk on the second lot independently from the ﬁrst.\nUsing Stop-Loss Orders to Manage Risk\nGiven the importance of money management to successful trading, using the stop-\nloss order is imperative for any trader looking to succeed in the currency market.\nStop-loss orders allow traders to specify the maximum loss they are willing to\naccept on any given trade. If the market reaches the rate the trader speciﬁes in\nhis/her stop-loss order, then the trade will be closed immediately. As a result, using\nstop-loss orders allows you to know how much you are risking at the time you enter\nthe trade.\nThere are two parts to successfully using a stop-loss order: (1) initially placing\nthe stop at a reasonable level and (2) trailing the stop—or moving it forward toward\nproﬁtability—as the trade progresses in your favor.\nPlacing the Stop Loss\nWe recommend two ways of placing a trailing stop-loss order:\n■The ﬁrst is a two-day low method . These volatility-based stops involve placing your\nstop-loss order approximately 10 to 20 pips below the two-day low of the pair.\nFor example, if the low on the EURUSD’s most recent candle was 1.1200, and\nthe previous candle’s low was 1.1100, then the stop should be placed around\n1.1090—10 pips below the two-day low—if a trader is looking to get long. This\ntype of trailing stop allows you to keep tight control of the position and minimizes\nthe time in trade. The downside is that it can be closed prematurely during a brief\nperiod of consolidation.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS88■Parabolic SAR . Another form of volatility-based stop is the parabolic SAR, an\nindicator that is found on many currency trading charting applications. This\nindicator graphically displays a small dot at the point on the chart where the stop\nshould be placed. The beneﬁt of parabolic SAR is that it is dynamic and generally\nfurther away from the current price.\nThere is no magic formula for what works best in every situation, but the\nfollowing is an example of how these stops could be used.\nUpon entering a long position, determine where support is and place a stop 20\npips below support. For example, let’s say this is 60 pips below the entry point. If\nthe trade earns a proﬁt of 60 pips, close half of my position using a market order,\nthen move the stop up to the entry point. At this point, trail the stop 60 pips behind\nthe moving market price. If the parabolic SAR moves up so that it is above the entry\npoint, you could switch to using parabolic SAR as the stop level. Of course, during\nthe day, there can be other signals that could prompt you to move your stop. If the\nprice breaks through a new resistance level, that resistance then becomes support.\nYou can place a stop 20 pips below that support level, even if it is only 30–40\npips away from the current price. The underlying principle you have to use is to\nﬁnd a point to place your stop where you would no longer want to be in the trade\nonce the price reaches that level. Usually it falls at a point where the price goes\nbelow support.\nAside from employing proper risk management strategies, one of the other\nmore crucial yet overlooked elements of successful trading is maintaining a healthy\npsychological outlook. At the end of the day, a trader who is unable to cope with the\nstress of market ﬂuctuations will not stand the test of time—no matter how skilled\nthey may be at the more scientiﬁc elements of trading. Here are some tips:\n■Practice emotional detachment . That is, traders must make trading decisions based on\nstrategies independent of fear and greed. One of the premiere attributes a good\ntrader has is emotional detachment: While these traders are dedicated and fully\ninvolved in their trades, they are not emotionally married to them; they accept\nlosing, and make their investment decisions on an intellectual level. Traders who\nare emotionally involved in trading often make substantial errors, as they tend\nto whimsically change their strategy after a few losing trades, or become overly\ncarefree after a few winning trades. A good trader must be emotionally balanced,\nand must base all trading decisions on strategy—not fear or greed.\n■Know when to take a break . In the midst of a losing streak, consider taking a break\nfrom trading before fear and greed dominate your strategy.\nNot every trade can be a winning one. As a result, traders must be psycholog-\nically capable of coping with losses. Most traders, even successful ones, will go\nthrough a stretch of losing trades. The key to being a successful trader, though,\nis being able to go through a losing stretch unfazed and undeterred. If you are\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS89experiencing a string of losing trades, it may be time to take a break from trading.\nOften, taking a few days off from watching the market to clear your mind can be\nthe best remedy for a losing streak. Continuing to trade relentlessly during a tough\nmarket condition can breed greater losses and ruin your psychological trading\ncapacity. Ultimately, it’s always better to acknowledge your losses rather than\ncontinue to ﬁght through them and pretend they don’t exist. Make no mistake\nabout it: Regardless of how much you study, practice, or trade, there will be losing\ntrades throughout your entire career. The key is to make them small enough that\nyou can live to trade another day and allow your winning trades room to breathe\nand ﬂourish. You can overcome a lot of bad luck with proper money management\ntechniques. This is why we have stressed a 2:1 reward to risk ratio, and why we\nrecommend not risking more than 2% of your equity on any single trade.\nWhether you are trading forex, equities, or futures, there are 10 trading rules\nthat successful traders should live by:\n1. Limit your losses.\n2. Let your proﬁts run.\n3. Keep position sizes within reason.\n4. Know your risk versus reward ratio.\n5. Be adequately capitalized.\n6. Don’t ﬁght the trend.\n7. Never add to losing positions.\n8. Know market expectations.\n9. Learn from your mistake—keep a trade log.\n10. Have a maximum drawdown."

        "73CHAPTER 7\nTrade Parameters\nfor Various Market\nConditions\nAfter learning about the emergence of the foreign exchange market, who the\nmajor players are, signiﬁcant historical milestones, and what moves the markets,\nit is time to move on and discuss some of my favorite strategies for trading currencies.\nHowever, before I even begin going over these strategies, the most important ﬁrst\nstep for any trader, regardless of the market that you are trading in, is to create a\ntrading journal.\n■Keep a Trading Journal\nThrough my experience, I have learned that being a successful trader is not about\nﬁnding the holy grail of indicators that can perfectly forecast movements 100% of\nthe time, but instead, to develop discipline. I cannot undermine the importance of\n‘‘the journal’’ as the primary ﬁrst step to becoming a successful and professional\ntrader. While working on the Inter-bank FX trading desk at J.P. Morgan and then\non the Cross-Markets trading desk after the merger with Chase, the trading journal\nmentality was engrained into the minds of every dealer and proprietary trader on the\ntrading ﬂoors, regardless of rank. The reason was simple—the bank was providing\nthe capital for trading and we needed to be held accountable, especially since each\ntransaction involved millions of dollars. For every trade that was executed, we\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS74needed to have a solid rationale as well as justiﬁcation for the choice of entry and exit\nlevels. More speciﬁcally, you had to know where to place your exit points before\nyou placed the trade to approximate worst case losses and to manage risk.\nWith this sort of accountability, the leading banks of the world are able to breed\nsuccessful and professional traders. For individual traders, this practice is even more\nimportant because you are trading with your own money and not someone else’s.\nBank traders are trading with someone else’s money so regardless of how poorly\nthey perform over a one- or two-week basis, they will receive their paycheck twice\na month. At a bank, traders have plenty of time to make the money back without any\ndisruptions to their daily way of life—unless of course they lose $1 million in one\nday. As an individual trader—you do not have this luxury. When you are trading\nwith your own money, each dollar lost is a dollar less that you own. So even though\nyou should only be trading with risk capital, or money that would not otherwise be\nused for rent or groceries, one way or the other, the pain is felt. To avoid repeating\nthe same mistakes and taking large losses, I cannot stress enough the importance of\nkeeping a trading journal. The journal is designed to ensure that as a trader, you\nonly take calculated losses and learn from each mistake. The trading journal setup\nthat I recommend should be broken up into three parts:\n1. Currency pair checklist\n2. Trades that I am waiting for\n3. Existing or completed trades\nCurrency Pair Checklist\nThe ﬁrst section of your trading journal should consist of a spreadsheet that can be\nprinted out and completed every day. This purpose of this checklist is to get a feel\nof the market and to identify trades. It should list of all of the currency pairs that are\noffered for trading on the left column, followed by three columns for the current,\nhigh, and low prices, and then a series of triggers laid out as a row on the right\nhand side. Newer traders should start with following only the four major currency\npairs, which are the EURUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, and the GBPUSD, and then\ngradually add the AUDUSD, USDCAD, and NZDUSD, followed by the nondollar\npairs. Although the checklist that I have created is fairly detailed, I ﬁnd that it is\na very useful daily exercise and should take no more than 20 minutes to complete\nonce the appropriate indicators are saved on the charts. The purpose of this checklist\nis to get a clear visual of which currencies are trending and which are range trading.\nComprehending the big picture is the ﬁrst step to trading successfully. Too often\nhave I seen traders fail because they lose sight of the overall environment that they\nare trading in. The worst thing to do is to trade blindly. Trying to pick tops or\nbottoms in a strong trend or buying breakouts in a range-bound environment can\nlead to signiﬁcant losses. Just take a look at Figure 7.1 of the EURUSD. If you tried\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS75\nFIGURE 7.1 EURUSD Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS76to pick bottoms in this pair, it would have led to an entire year of frustrating and\nunsuccessful trading. In trending environments, traders will ﬁnd a higher success\nrate by buying on retracements in an uptrend or selling on rallies in a downtrend.\nPicking tops and bottoms should only be a strategy that is used in clear range trading\nenvironments and even with that, traders need to be careful of contracting ranges\nthat can lead to breakout scenarios.\nA simpliﬁed version of the daily market overview sheet that I use is shown in\nFigure 7.2.\nAs you can see in Figure 7.2, the ﬁrst two columns after the daily high and low\nprices are the levels of the 10-day high or low. Recording this price helps to identify\nwhere current prices are within previous price action. This helps traders get a gauge\nof whether we are pressing toward a 10-day high or low or if we are simply trapped\nin the middle of the range. Yet the prices alone do not provide enough information\nto determine if we are in a trending or a range-bound environment. The next ﬁve\nindicators is a checklist for determining a trending environment. The more X marks\nin this section, the stronger the trend.\nThe ﬁrst column in the trending indicator group is the ‘‘ADX (14) above 25.’’\nADX is the Accumulation Distribution Index, which is the most popular used\nindicator for determining the strength of a trend. If the index reading is above 25,\nit indicates that a trend has developed. Generally speaking, the greater the number,\nthe stronger the trend. The next column is Bollinger Bands. When strong trends\ndevelop, the pair will frequently tag and cross either the upper or lower Bollinger\nBand. The next three trend indicators are the longer term moving averages. A\nbreak above or below these moving averages may also be indicative of a trending\nenvironment. With moving averages, crossovers in the direction of the trend can be\nused as a further conﬁrmation. If there are two or more Xs in this section, traders\nshould be looking for opportunities to buy on dips in an uptrend or sell on rallies in a\ndowntrend rather than selling at the top and buying back at the bottom of the range.\nThe last section of the trading journal is indications of range. The ﬁrst indicator is\nalso ADX, but this time, we are looking for ADX below 25, which signals that the\ncurrency pair’s trend is weak. Next, we look at the traditional oscillators, RSI and\nstochastics. If the ADX is weak and there is signiﬁcant technical resistance above,\nprovided by indicators such as moving averages or Fibonacci retracement levels,\nand RSI and/or stochastics are at overbought or oversold levels, we identify an\nenvironment that is highly conducive to range trading.\nOf course, the market overview sheet is not foolproof, and just because you have\na lot of X marks in either the trend or range group doesn’t mean that a trend will\nnot fade or a breakout will not occur. Yet, what this spreadsheet will do is prevent\ntraders from trading blindly and ignoring the broader market conditions. It provides\ntraders with a launching pad from which to identify the day’s trading opportunities.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS77Date - Time\nTrending Range\nCurrencyPair Current\nPriceDaily\nHighDaily\nLow10-day\nHigh10-day\nLowBollinger\nBand UpBollinger\nBand Down(14)\nabove 25Crosses\n50-DayCrosses\n100-dayCrosses\n200-dayBollinger\nBand\nRangeADX\n(14)\nbelow\n25RS1 (14)\nGreater\nthan 80(14)\nLess\nthan 80Stochastics\n>70Stochastics\n<30\nEURUSD 1.105 1.1144 1.0923 X X X X\nGBPUSD\nUSDJPY\nUSDCHF\nAUDUSD\nNZDUSD\nUSDCAD\nEURJPY\nEURGBP\nEURCHF\nAUDJPY\nCHFJPY\nGBPJPY\nGBPCHF\nAUDCAD\nEURCAD\nAUDNZD\nFIGURE 7.2 Currency Checklist\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS78Trades That I Am Waiting For\nThe next section in the trading journal lists out the possible trades for the day. Based\non an initial overview of the charts, this section is where you should list the trades\nfor which you are waiting. A sample entry would look like the following:\nApril 5, 2015\nBuy AUDUSD on a break of 0.7850 (previous day high)\nStop at 0.7800 (50-day SMA)\nTarget 1—0.7925 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement of Nov-Mar bull wave)\nTarget 2—0.8075 (Upper Bollinger)\nTarget 3—10-day Trailing Low\nAs soon as your entry level is reached, you know exactly how to take action and\nwhere to place your stops and limits. Of course, it is also important to take a quick\nglance at the market to make sure that the trading conditions that you were waiting\nfor are still intact. For example, if you were looking for a strong breakout with no\nretracement to occur at the entry level, when it does break, you want to make sure\nthat the break has decent momentum. This exercise will help you develop a plan of\naction to approach your trading day. Before every battle, warriors will regroup to\ngo over the plan of attack—in trading, you want to have the same mentality. Plan\nand prepare for the worst-case scenario and know your plan of attack for the day!\nExisting or Completed Trades\nThis section is developed and used to enforce discipline and to learn from your\nmistakes. At the end of each trading day, it is important to review this section to\nunderstand why certain trades resulted in losses and others in proﬁts. The purpose\nof this section is to identify trends. To understand why this is important, let’s look\nat an example that is completely unrelated to trading. On a normal given day,\nmost people will subconsciously inject a lot of ‘‘ums’’ or ‘‘uhs’’ into their daily\nconversation. However, most of these people do not even realize that they are even\ndoing so until someone records their conversation and replays it back to them. This\nis one of the ways that professional presenters and newscasters train to kick the\nhabit of using placeholder words. Having worked with over 65,000 traders, too\noften have I seen these traders make the same mistakes repeatedly. This includes\ntaking proﬁts too early, letting losses run, getting emotional about trading, ignoring\neconomic releases, or entering a trade prematurely. Keeping a record of previous\ntrades is like keeping a recording of your conversations. When you ﬂip back to the\ntrades that you have completed, you may have a perfect map of what strategies have\nor have not been proﬁtable for you. The reason why a journal is so important is\nbecause it minimizes the emotional intervention of trades. I frequently see novice\ntraders take proﬁts early but let losses run. The following are two samples of trade\njournal entries that could have provided learning opportunities:\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS79February 12, 2015\nTrade: Short 3 lots of EURUSD @ 1.1045\nStop: 1.1195 (former all-time high)\nTarget: 1.0800\nResult: Trade closed on Feb 13, 2015—stopped out of the 3 lots @ 1.1195\n(–150 pips)\nComments: Got margin call! It broke the all-time high, I thought it was going\nto reverse, did not stick to stop—kept letting losses run, eventually margin\ncall closed out all positions. Note to self: MAKE SURE STICK TO STOPS!\nApril 3, 2015\nTrade: Long 2 lots of USDCAD @ 1.2135\nStop: 1.2000 (strong technical support—conﬂuence of 50-day moving average\nand 68% Fibonacci retracement of Feb—March rally)\nTarget: First lot @ 1.2295 (upper Bollinger and 5 pips shy of 1.2300 psychological\nresistance)\nSecond lot @ 1.2450 (Former head and shoulders support turned resistance,\n100-day SMA)\nResult: Trade closed on April 5, 2015—stopped out of the 2 lots at 1.2000\n(–135 pips)\nComments: USDCAD did not continue uptrend and was becoming overbought,\nI didn’t see that ADX was weakening and falling from higher levels, there was\nalso a divergence in Stochastics. Note to self: MAKE SURE TO LOOK FOR\nDIVERGENCES NEXT TIME!\nUnlike many traders, the best trades in my opinion are the trades where both\ntechnicals and fundamentals support the trade. In general, I prefer to stay out of\ntrades that contradict my fundamental outlook. For example, if there is a bullish\nformation in both the GBPUSD and the AUDUSD due to U.S. dollar weakness,\nbut the Bank of England has ﬁnished raising interest rates, while the Reserve\nBank of Australia has full intentions of tightening to tame the strength of the\nAustralian economy, I would most likely choose to express my bearish dollar view\nin the AUDUSD rather than the GBPUSD. My bias for choosing the AUDUSD\nover the GBPUSD would be even stronger if the AUDUSD already offered a\nhigher interest rate differential than the GBPUSD. I seen technicals thwarted by\nfundamentals so often that now I always incorporate both into my trading strategy.\nI use a combination of technical, fundamental, and positioning, and am generally\nalso a trend follower. I also typically use a top-down approach that involves the\nfollowing:\n1. I will start by taking an overall technical survey of the market and pick the\ncurrency pairs that have retraced to attractive levels for entry in order to\nparticipate in a medium term fundamentally supportive trend.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS802. For currencies with a dollar component (i.e., not the crosses), I determine if my\ninitial technical view for that pair coincides with my fundamental view on the\ndollar, as well as my view on how upcoming U.S. releases may impact trading\nfor the day. The reason why I look at the dollar speciﬁcally is because 80% of all\ncurrency trades involve the dollar, which makes U.S. fundamentals particularly\nimportant.\n3. If it is a cross, I will proceed by determining if the technical view coincides with\nthe fundamental outlook using Fibonacci retracements, ADX, moving averages,\noscillators, and other technical tools.\n4. Then I like to look at positioning using the Commitment of Traders Report or\nthe FXCM Speculative Sentiment index to see if it supports the trade.\n5. If I am left with two equally compelling trade ideas, I will choose the one with\na positive interest rate differential.\nHave a Toolbox—Use What Works for the Current Market\nEnvironment\nOnce you have created a trading journal, it is time to ﬁgure out which indicators to\nlay on your charts. The reason why a lot of traders fail is because they neglect to\nrealize that their favorite indicators are not foolproof. Buying when stochastics are\nin oversold territory and selling when it is in overbought territory is a strategy that\nis used quite often by range traders, to a great deal of success, but once the market\nstops range trading and begins to trend, then relying on stochastics could lead to\ntremendous amount of losses. In order to become consistently proﬁtable, successful\ntraders need to learn to be adaptable.\nOne of the most important practices that every trader must understand is to be\nconscious of the environment that they are trading in. Every trader needs to have\nsome sort of checklist that will help to classify the trading environment so that\nthey can determine whether the market is trending or range bound. Deﬁning\ntrade parameters is one of the most important disciplines of trading. Too many\ntraders have tried to pick the top within a trend, only to wind up with consistently\nunproﬁtable trades.\nAlthough deﬁning trade parameters is important to traders in any market\n(currencies, futures, equities), it is particularly important in the currency market\nsince over 80% of the volume is speculative in nature. This means that currencies\ncan spend a very long period of time in a certain trading environment. Also, the\ncurrency market obeys technical analysis particularly well, given its large scale and\nnumber of participants.\nThere are basically two types of trading environments, which means that at any\npoint in time an instrument is either range trading or trending. The ﬁrst step every\ntrader needs to take is to deﬁne the current trading environment. The shortest time\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS81frame that traders should start looking at when their trading day starts are daily\ncharts, even if you are trading on a 5-minute time frame.\n■Step #1: Determine the Trading Environment\nRules to Determining Trading Environment\nThere are many different ways that traders can determine whether a currency pair\nis range trading or trending. Of course, many people do it visually, but having set\nrules will help to keep traders out of trends that may be fading or to prevent traders\nfrom getting into a range trade in the midst of a possible breakout. In Figure 7.3, I\nhave outlined some of the rules that I look for in order to classify a currency pair’s\ntrading environment.\nProﬁling a Range Environment\nLook for:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) less than 20 —The Average Directional Index is\none of the primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a\ntrend. When ADX is less than 20, this suggests that the trend is weak, which\nis generally characteristic of range-bound market. If ADX is less than 20 and\ntrending downward, it provides a further conﬁrmation that the trend is not only\nweak but will probably stay in a range-trading environment for a while longer.\n2.Decreasing implied volatility —There are many ways to analyze volatility. What I\nlike to do is actually track short-term versus long-term volatility. When short-\nterm volatility is falling, especially after a burst above long-term volatility, it\nis usually indicative of a reversion to range trading scenarios. Volatility usually\nTrade Rules Indicators\nRange ■ADX<20\n■Decreasing implied volatility\n■Risk reversals near choice or ﬂipping\nbetween favoring calls and putsBollinger, Bands, ADX,\nOptions\nTrend ■ADX>25\n■Momentum consistent with trend\ndirection\n■Risk reversals strongly bid for put or callMoving\naverages, ADX, Options,\nMomentum\nFIGURE 7.3 Trend/Range Trading Rules\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS82blows out when a currency pair experiences sharp, quick moves. It contracts\nwhen ranges are narrow and the trading is very quiet in the markets. The lazy\nman’s version of the way I track volatility is Bollinger Bands, which is actually\nalso a fairly decent measure for determining volatility conditions. A narrow\nBollinger Band suggests that ranges are small and there is low volatility in the\nmarkets, while wide Bollinger Bands are reﬂective of large ranges and a highly\nvolatile environment. In a range-trading environment, we are looking for fairly\nnarrow Bollinger Bands, ideally in a horizontal formation similar to the USDJPY\nchart in Figure 7.4.\n3.Risk reversals ﬂipping between calls and puts : A risk reversal consists of a pair of\noptions, a call and a put, on the same currency. Risk reversals have both the\nsame expiration (1 month) and sensitivity to the underlying spot rate. They are\nquoted in terms of the difference in volatility between the two options. While\nin theory these options should have the same implied volatility in practice, these\nvolatilities often differ in the market. Risk reversals can be seen as having a\nmarket polling function. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates\nthat the market prefers calls over puts. The reverse is true if the number is\nstrongly in favor of puts versus calls. Thus, risk reversals can be used as a\nsubstitute for gauging positions in the FX market. In an ideal environment, far\nout of the money calls and puts should have the same volatility. However, this\nis rarely the case, since there is generally a sentiment bias in the markets that\nis reﬂected in risk reversals. In range-bound environments, risk reversals tend\nFIGURE 7.4 USDJPY Bollinger Band Chart\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS83to ﬂip between favoring calls and puts at nearly zero (or equal). This indicates\nthat there is indecision among bulls and bears, and there is no strong bias in\nthe markets.\nWhat Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nAccording to the risk reversals in Figure 7.5, we can see that the market is strongly\nfavoring yen calls (JC) and dollar puts over the long term. EURUSD short-term\nrisk reversals are near choice, which is what you are looking for when proﬁling a\nrange-bound environment. Risk reversal information used to be readily available\nbut is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd these days. Currently, the only place we know of that\nprovides this information is the Bloomberg Professional Terminal, which costs over\nUS$1500 a month.\nIdentifying a Trending Environment\nLook for three things:\n1.ADX (Average Directional Index) greater than 20 —As mentioned earlier when we\ntalked about range-trading conditions, the Average Directional Index is one of\nthe primary technical indicators used to determine the strength of a trend. In\na trending environment, we look for ADX to be greater than 25 and rising. If\nADX is greater than 25 but sloping downward, especially off of the extreme 40\nlevel, you have to be careful of aggressive trend positioning since it may indicate\nthat the trend is waning.\n2.Momentum consistent with trend direction —In addition to using ADX, I also\nrecommend looking for conﬁrmation of a trending environment through\nmomentum indicators. Traders should look for momentum to be consistent\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nCurrency 1M R/R 3M R/R 6M R/R 1YR R/R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 JC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C=Japanese yen call * SC =Sterling call\n*E C=Euro call * CC =Swiss call\n*S P=Sterling put\nFIGURE 7.5 Risk Reversals\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS84with the direction of the trend. Most currency traders will look for oscillators to\npoint strongly in the direction of the trend. For example, in an uptrend, trend\ntraders will look for the moving averages, RSI, stochastics, and MACD to all\npoint strongly upward. In a downtrend, they will look for these same indicators\nto point downward. Some currency traders use the momentum index, but in\nmy experience, it is less popular and reliable. Instead, one of the strongest\nmomentum indicators is a perfect order of moving averages. A perfect order is\nwhen we have the moving averages line up perfectly: that is, for an uptrend,\nthe 10-day SMA is greater than the 20-day SMA, which is greater 50-day SMA.\nThe 100-day SMA and the 200-day SMA are below the shorter-term moving\naverages. In a downtrend, a perfect order would be when the shorter-term\nmoving averages stack up below the longer-term moving averages.\n3.Options (risk reversals)— With a trending environment, we are looking for risk\nreversals to strongly favor calls or puts. When one side of the market is laden\nwith interest, it is usually indicative of a strong trending environment or that a\ncontra-trend move may be brewing if risk reversals are at extreme levels.\n■Step #2: Determine the Time Frame for Trade\nOnce you have determined that a currency pair is either range-bound or trending,\nit is time to determine how long you plan on holding the trade. The following is a\nset of guidelines and indicators that I use for trading different time frames. Not all\nof the guidelines need to be met, but the more guidelines that are met, the more\nsolid the trading opportunity.\nIntraday Trade (Range)\nRules:\n1. Use hourly charts to determine entry points and daily charts to conﬁrm that a\nrange trade exists on a longer-time frame.\n2. Use oscillators to determine entry point within range.\n3. Look for short-dated risk reversals to be near choice.\n4. Look for reversal in oscillators (RSI or stochastics at extreme point).\n5. Trade stronger when prices fail at key resistance or hold key support levels (use\nFibonacci retracement points and moving averages).\nIndicators Used:\nStochastics, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, options, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS85Medium-Term Range Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. There are two ways to range trade medium term—position for upcoming range\ntrading opportunities or get involved in existing ranges.\n3.Upcoming range opportunities : Look for high-volatility environments, where short-\nterm implied volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than longer-term volatilities.\nSeek reversion back to the mean environments.\n4.Existing ranges : Use Bollinger Bands to identify existing ranges.\n5. Look for reversals in oscillators such as RSI and stochastics.\n6. Make sure ADX is below 25 and ideally falling.\n7. Look for medium-term risk reversals near choice.\n8. Conﬁrm with price action—failure at key range resistances and bounces on key\nrange supports (using traditional technical indicators).\nIndicators:\nOptions, Bollinger Bands, stochastics, MACD, RSI, Fibonacci retracement\nlevels\nMedium-Term Trend Trade\nRules:\n1. Look for ranges on daily charts and use weekly charts for conﬁrmation.\n2. Refer back to the characteristics of a trending environment—look for those\nparameters to be met.\n3. Buy breakout/retracement scenarios on key Fibonacci levels or moving averages.\n4. Look for no major resistance levels in front of trade.\n5. Look for candlestick pattern conﬁrmation.\n6. Look for moving average conﬂuence to be on same side of trade.\n7. Enter on a break of signiﬁcant high or low.\n8. The ideal is to wait for volatilities to contract before getting in.\n9. Look for fundamentals to also be supportive of trade—growth and interest\nrates. You want to see a string of economic surprises or disappointments\ndepending on directional bias.\nIndicators\nADX, Parabolic SAR, RSI, Ichimoku Clouds, Elliot waves, Fibonacci\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS86Medium-Term Breakout Trade\nRules:\n1. Use daily charts.\n2. Look for contraction in short-term volatility to a point where it is sharply below\nlong-term volatility.\n3. Use pivot points to determine whether a break is a true break or a false break.\n4. Look for moving average conﬂuences to be supportive of trade.\nIndicators\nBollinger Bands, moving averages, Fibonacci\n■Risk Management\nAlthough risk management is one of the more simple topics to grasp, it is also one\nof the most important. Too often we have seen traders turn winning positions into\nlosing positions and solid strategies result in losses instead of proﬁts. The fact of the\nmatter is that regardless of how intelligent and knowledgeable a trader may be about\nthe markets, their own psychology will cause them to lose money. Why does this\nhappen? Are the markets really so enigmatic that few can proﬁt? Or is there simply\na common mistake that virtually all traders are prone to making? The answer is the\nlatter. And the good news is that the problem, while it can be an emotionally and\npsychologically challenging, is ultimately fairly easy to grasp and solve.\nMost traders lose money simply because they have no understanding or place no\nimportance in risk management . Risk management involves essentially knowing how\nmuch you are willing to risk and how much you are looking to gain. Without a\nsense of risk management, most traders simply hold on to losing positions for an\nextremely long amount of time, but take proﬁts on winning positions prematurely.\nThe result is a seemingly paradoxical scenario that in reality is all too common: The\ntrader ends up having more winning positions than losing ones, but ends up with a\nnegative P/L. So, what can traders do to ensure they have solid risk management\nhabits? There are a few key guidelines that every trader, regardless of their strategy\nor what they are trading, should keep in mind:\n■Risk-reward ratio . Traders should look to establish a risk-reward ratio for every\ntrade they place. In other words, they should have an idea of how much they are\nwilling to lose, and how much they are looking to gain. Generally, the risk-reward\nratio should be at least 1:2, if not more. Having a solid risk-reward ratio can\nprevent traders from entering positions that ultimately are not worth the risk.\n■Stop-loss orders . Traders should also employ stop-loss orders as a way of specifying\nthe maximum loss they are willing to accept. By using stop-loss orders, traders\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS87can avoid the common predicament of being in a scenario where they have many\nwinning trades but a single loss large enough to eliminate any trace of proﬁtability\nin the account. Trailing stops to lock in proﬁts are particularly useful. A good\nhabit of more successful traders is to employ the rule of moving your stop to\nbreak even as soon as your position has proﬁted by the same amount that you\ninitially risked through the stop order. At the same time, some traders may also\nchoose to close a portion of their position.\nFor those looking to add to a winning position or go with trend, the best strategy\nis to treat it as if it were a new trade of its own, independent of the winning position.\nIf you are going to add to a winning position, perform the same analysis of the chart\nthat you would if you had no position at all. If a trade continues to go in your favor,\nyou can also close out part of the position while trailing your stop higher on the\nremaining lots that you are holding. Try thinking about your risk and reward on\neach separate lot that you have bought if they are at different entry points as well. If\nyou buy a second lot 50 pips above your ﬁrst entry point, don’t use the same stop\nprice on both, but manage the risk on the second lot independently from the ﬁrst.\nUsing Stop-Loss Orders to Manage Risk\nGiven the importance of money management to successful trading, using the stop-\nloss order is imperative for any trader looking to succeed in the currency market.\nStop-loss orders allow traders to specify the maximum loss they are willing to\naccept on any given trade. If the market reaches the rate the trader speciﬁes in\nhis/her stop-loss order, then the trade will be closed immediately. As a result, using\nstop-loss orders allows you to know how much you are risking at the time you enter\nthe trade.\nThere are two parts to successfully using a stop-loss order: (1) initially placing\nthe stop at a reasonable level and (2) trailing the stop—or moving it forward toward\nproﬁtability—as the trade progresses in your favor.\nPlacing the Stop Loss\nWe recommend two ways of placing a trailing stop-loss order:\n■The ﬁrst is a two-day low method . These volatility-based stops involve placing your\nstop-loss order approximately 10 to 20 pips below the two-day low of the pair.\nFor example, if the low on the EURUSD’s most recent candle was 1.1200, and\nthe previous candle’s low was 1.1100, then the stop should be placed around\n1.1090—10 pips below the two-day low—if a trader is looking to get long. This\ntype of trailing stop allows you to keep tight control of the position and minimizes\nthe time in trade. The downside is that it can be closed prematurely during a brief\nperiod of consolidation.\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS88■Parabolic SAR . Another form of volatility-based stop is the parabolic SAR, an\nindicator that is found on many currency trading charting applications. This\nindicator graphically displays a small dot at the point on the chart where the stop\nshould be placed. The beneﬁt of parabolic SAR is that it is dynamic and generally\nfurther away from the current price.\nThere is no magic formula for what works best in every situation, but the\nfollowing is an example of how these stops could be used.\nUpon entering a long position, determine where support is and place a stop 20\npips below support. For example, let’s say this is 60 pips below the entry point. If\nthe trade earns a proﬁt of 60 pips, close half of my position using a market order,\nthen move the stop up to the entry point. At this point, trail the stop 60 pips behind\nthe moving market price. If the parabolic SAR moves up so that it is above the entry\npoint, you could switch to using parabolic SAR as the stop level. Of course, during\nthe day, there can be other signals that could prompt you to move your stop. If the\nprice breaks through a new resistance level, that resistance then becomes support.\nYou can place a stop 20 pips below that support level, even if it is only 30–40\npips away from the current price. The underlying principle you have to use is to\nﬁnd a point to place your stop where you would no longer want to be in the trade\nonce the price reaches that level. Usually it falls at a point where the price goes\nbelow support.\nAside from employing proper risk management strategies, one of the other\nmore crucial yet overlooked elements of successful trading is maintaining a healthy\npsychological outlook. At the end of the day, a trader who is unable to cope with the\nstress of market ﬂuctuations will not stand the test of time—no matter how skilled\nthey may be at the more scientiﬁc elements of trading. Here are some tips:\n■Practice emotional detachment . That is, traders must make trading decisions based on\nstrategies independent of fear and greed. One of the premiere attributes a good\ntrader has is emotional detachment: While these traders are dedicated and fully\ninvolved in their trades, they are not emotionally married to them; they accept\nlosing, and make their investment decisions on an intellectual level. Traders who\nare emotionally involved in trading often make substantial errors, as they tend\nto whimsically change their strategy after a few losing trades, or become overly\ncarefree after a few winning trades. A good trader must be emotionally balanced,\nand must base all trading decisions on strategy—not fear or greed.\n■Know when to take a break . In the midst of a losing streak, consider taking a break\nfrom trading before fear and greed dominate your strategy.\nNot every trade can be a winning one. As a result, traders must be psycholog-\nically capable of coping with losses. Most traders, even successful ones, will go\nthrough a stretch of losing trades. The key to being a successful trader, though,\nis being able to go through a losing stretch unfazed and undeterred. If you are\nTRADE PARAMETERS FOR VARIOUS MARKET CONDITIONS89experiencing a string of losing trades, it may be time to take a break from trading.\nOften, taking a few days off from watching the market to clear your mind can be\nthe best remedy for a losing streak. Continuing to trade relentlessly during a tough\nmarket condition can breed greater losses and ruin your psychological trading\ncapacity. Ultimately, it’s always better to acknowledge your losses rather than\ncontinue to ﬁght through them and pretend they don’t exist. Make no mistake\nabout it: Regardless of how much you study, practice, or trade, there will be losing\ntrades throughout your entire career. The key is to make them small enough that\nyou can live to trade another day and allow your winning trades room to breathe\nand ﬂourish. You can overcome a lot of bad luck with proper money management\ntechniques. This is why we have stressed a 2:1 reward to risk ratio, and why we\nrecommend not risking more than 2% of your equity on any single trade.\nWhether you are trading forex, equities, or futures, there are 10 trading rules\nthat successful traders should live by:\n1. Limit your losses.\n2. Let your proﬁts run.\n3. Keep position sizes within reason.\n4. Know your risk versus reward ratio.\n5. Be adequately capitalized.\n6. Don’t ﬁght the trend.\n7. Never add to losing positions.\n8. Know market expectations.\n9. Learn from your mistake—keep a trade log.\n10. Have a maximum drawdown."

        "91CHAPTER 8\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Multiple\nTime Frame\nAnalysis\nTo trade successfully on an intraday basis, it is important to be selective. Trend\ntrading is one of the most popular strategies employed by global macro hedge\nfunds. Although many traders prefer to range trade, the big proﬁt potentials tend to\nlie in trades that capture and participate in big market moves. It was once said by\nMark Boucher, a hedge fund manager of Midas Trust Fund and a former number-one\nmoney manager as ranked by Nelson’s World Best Money Managers, that 70% of a\nmarket’s moves occurs 20% of the time. This makes multiple time frame analysis\nparticularly important, because no trader wants to lose sight of the big picture. A\ngreat comparison would be to imagine taking a road trip from Chicago to Florida.\nThere are going to be a lot of left and right turns along the way, but the most\nimportant thing to be aware of during the trip is that you should be headed south.\nThe same approach should be taken in trading. Looking for opportunities to buy in\nan uptrend or sell in a downtrend can be far much more proﬁtable than trying to\npick tops and bottoms.\nThe most common form of multiple time frame analysis is to use daily charts to\nidentify the overall trend and then use the hourly charts to determine speciﬁc entry\nlevels.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS92\nFIGURE 8.1 USDJPY Monthly Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTake a look at the USDJPY chart in Figure 8.1. This is a daily chart of the\nU.S. dollar against the Japanese yen (USDJPY). As you can see, USDJPY has been\ntrending higher since late 2012. During this period, range or contrarian traders\nlooking to pick tops would have been faced with at least two years of difﬁcult and\nmost likely unproﬁtable trading—particularly when the currency pair was hitting\nthree- or four-year highs in late 2013 and early 2014. This area would have certainly\nattracted a good deal of traders looking to pick a top or to fade the trend. Despite\na dip in mid-2013, USDJPY remained strong going into 2105, making life very\ndifﬁcult for medium-term range players.\nInstead, the more effective trading str ategy would have been to take a position\nin the direction of the trend. In USDJPY, this would have involved looking for\nopportunities to buy on dips. Figure 8.2 shows one way to do so on a 15-minute\nchart using the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Rather than looking for opportunities\nto sell when RSI rose above 70, it was smarter to buy when it dipped to 30. The ﬁrst\nhorizontal line in Figure 8.2 shows the point at which RSI rose above 70. If you sold\nat that level, USDJPY would have moved against you by 40 pips before reversing.\nThe second horizontal line shows the point at which RSI dipped to 30. If you bought\nat that level, you would have picked the bottom on this short term USDJPY chart\nfor a move of at least 50 pips.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS93\nFIGURE 8.2 USDJPY 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nNow let’s take a look at another example of the British pound. Figure 8.3\nshows the monthly chart of the USDCAD from January 2013 to January 2015. Like\nUSDJPY, traders trying to pick tops in the USDCAD would have faced at least two\nstraight years of difﬁcult trading—particularly when the USDCAD was climbing\nto fresh ﬁve-year highs in late 2014 early 2015. This level would have certainly\nattracted a number of top pickers. To the frustration of those who tried to fade\nthe move, USDCAD rallied 9% beyond its ﬁve-year highs, which means those top\npickers would have incurred signiﬁcant losses. Taking a look at the hourly chart for\nthe USDCAD, we want to look for opportunities to buy on dips rather than sell on\nrallies. Figure 8.4 shows Fibonacci retracement levels drawn from the 2002 to 2008\nbear wave. Those levels held pretty well with declines ﬁnding support at the 38.2%\nFibonacci retracements between January 2008, Janua ry 2009, and January 2015.\nMultiple time frame analysis can also be employed on a shorter-term basis. Let\nus take a look at an example using CHFJPY. First we start with the hourly chart\nof CHFJPY, shown in Figure 8.5. Using Fibonacci retracements, we can see on the\nhourly charts that prices have failed at the 38.2% retracement of the December 30,\n2004, to February 9, 2005, bear wave numerous times. This indicates that the\npair is contained within a weeklong downtrend below those levels. In this case,\nwe want to use our 15-minute charts to look for entry levels to participate in the\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS94\nFIGURE 8.3 USDCAD Weekly Chart\nSource: eSignal\noverall downtrend. However, in order to increase the successfulness of this trade,\nwe want to make sure that CHFJPY is also in a downtrend on a daily basis. Taking\na look at Figure 8.6, we can see that CHFJPY is indeed trading below the 200-day\nsimple moving average, with the 20-day SMA crossing below the 100-day SMA. This\nconﬁrms the bearish momentum in the currency pair. So as a day trader, we move to\nthe 15-minute chart to identify entry levels. Figure 8.7 is the 15-minute chart; the\nhorizontal line is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the earlier downtrend. We\nsee that CHFJPY broke above the horizontal line on May 11, 2005; however, rather\nthan buying into a potential breakout trade, the bearish big picture reﬂected on the\nhourly and daily charts point to a contrarian trade. In fact, there were two instances\nshown in Figure 8.7 where the currency pair broke above the Fibonacci level only\nto trade signiﬁcantly lower. Disciplined day traders would use those opportunities\nto fade the breakout.\nThe importance of multiple time frame analysis cannot be underestimated.\nLooking at the big picture ﬁrst can help to keep traders out of a lot of dangerous\ntrades. The majority of new traders in the market are range traders for the simple\nfact that buying at the low and selling at the high is an easy concept to grasp.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS95\nFIGURE 8.4 USDCAD Hourly Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS\nk\nk96\nk\nk\nFIGURE 8.5 CHFJPY Hourly Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS97\nFIGURE 8.6 CHFJPY Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS\nk\nk98\nk\nk\nFIGURE 8.7 CHFJPY 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS99Of course, this strategy will work from time to time, but traders need to be\nmindful of the overall trading environment if they want to be consistently proﬁtable.\nReferencing back to Chapter 7, range traders should only try to play the trade\nwhen the conditions for a range bound market are met. One useful way to identify\nthis type of market is to look for ADX to be less than 25 and ideally trending\ndownward."

        "101CHAPTER 9\nTechnical Strategy:\nTrading with\nDouble Bollinger\nBands\nOne of the most useful technical indicators in my experience is Bollinger Bands.\nTraditionally, Bollinger Bands are used as overbought and oversold indicators,\nbut given the trending nature of currencies, there are more efﬁcient ways to use the\nbands. Traditionally, Bollinger Bands consists of three lines—the 20-period moving\naverage and the two standard deviation bands above and below the moving average.\nIf the currency pair rises to the upper Bollinger Band, it is considered overbought\nbecause the move extended to an extreme level and should therefore be faded. The\nsame is true if it drops to the lower Bollinger Band. Unfortunately, currencies are\ntrending, and using the 20-period two standard deviation bands may not be the best\nway to trade. Take a look at Figure 9.1. In this daily chart of EURUSD, the arrows\nhighlight the points where the currency pair ‘‘hugs’’ the second standard deviation\nband. If you bought each time EURUSD touched the lower band or sold each time it\ntouched the upper band, there would be signiﬁcant losses before the currency pair\nﬁnally turned around.\nThe better technique would be to add another set of Bollinger Bands—the 20-\nperiod, one-standard deviation. This would put four bands on the chart if the basis\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS102\nFIGURE 9.1 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS103or the 20-period moving average is removed, and most charting packages will allow\nyou to do that. Figure 9.2 shows how the same EURUSD daily chart with look with\ntwo sets of Bollinger Bands. The outer lines are the two-standard-deviation Bollinger\nBands, and the two inner lines are the one-standard-deviation Bollinger Bands.\n■Using Double Bollinger Bands to Pick Tops\nand Bottoms\nHaving two sets of Bollinger Bands on your chart is a much more effective way\nto pick a top or bottom in currencies. The general rule of thumb is that we don’t\nbuy a bottom until the currency pair has traded above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. Along the same lines, we do not sell a top until the pair trades\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. While this technique may not\npick the perfect bottom, it can help avoid prematurely picking a top or bottom\nwhich can mean major losses in a trending environment. Here are the rules for the\nlong and short trades on a daily chart for picking tops and bottoms using the double\nBollinger Bands.\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be trading between the lower ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, BUY at close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 50 pips below ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be tra ding between the upper ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 30 pips above ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nLets take a look at the same EURUSD chart. Figure 9.3 shows the points at which\na trade would have been entered, and in most cases, it was a more effective way to\npick a top or bottom in the currency pair.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS104\nFIGURE 9.2 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS\nk\nk105\nk\nk\nFIGURE 9.3 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS106\nFIGURE 9.4 EURUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nNow let’s take a look at some examples in more detail. In Figure 9.4, we see that\non May 18, the EURUSD, which had been trading between the two upper bands,\nfell strongly to break out of the zone and close below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. We sell at the NY close (there’s usually a leeway of two hours). A\ntwo-lot trade is established at 1.1313 with a stop 30 pips above the ﬁrst standard\ndeviation Bollinger Band (1.1341) at 1.1371. The risk is 58 pips, which means that\nthe ﬁrst exit is 1.1313 minus 58 pips or 1.1255. The second proﬁt target is 1.1197,\nwhich is two times risk or 116 pips. The ﬁrst and second proﬁt targets are reached\non the very next day when the currency pair drops to a low of 1.1119, for a proﬁt\nof 58 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and another 116 pips on the second half. If\nthe stop was trailed using a moving average or percentage, a trader may have been\nable to capitalize on th e selloff that ensued.\nFigure 9.5 shows that on June 2, the EURUSD, which had been trading between\nthe two lower bands, rose strongly to break out of the zone and close ﬁrmly above\nthe ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. We buy at the NY close (there’s usually\na leeway of two hours). A two-lot trade is e stablished at 1.1151, with a stop 30 pips\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band (1.0970) at 1.0940. The risk is 211\npips, which means that the ﬁrst exit is 1.1151 plus 211 pips, or 1.1361. This proﬁt\ntarget is reached two days later, when the currency pair races to a high of 1.1380.\nAt the time, the stop is moved to 1.1151, and the following day the breakeven stop\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS107\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nC u r r e n c y 1 MR / R 3 MR / R 6 MR / R 1 Y RR / R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 :IC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC. 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C =Japanese Yen Call * SC =Sterling Call\n*E C =Euro Call * CC =Swiss Call\n*S P =Sterling Put\nFIGURE 9.5 EURUSD Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nis hit, and we end up banking only +211 on the ﬁrst half of the trade with no losses\nor gains on the second half.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Determine Trend versus Range\nIn addition to identifying levels to pick tops and bottoms, the double Bollinger Bands\ncan also be very helpful in determining the market environment. One of the most\ncommonly asked questions in forex is whether a currency pair is in trend or range.\nWhen the pair is trading be tween the two lower or upper Bollinger Bands, it is in\ntrend, and when it is trading between the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Bands,\nit is in range, as shown in Figure 9.6. When the currency pair is in trend mode,\nit is best to look for opportunities to join the trend. When it is in the range zone,\npicking tops and bottoms is preferred.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Join a New Trend\nAnother way to use the double Bollinger Bands is to join a new uptrend or downtrend\nusing a daily chart. Here are the trading rules:\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, buyat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS108\nFIGURE 9.6 GBPUSD Bollinger Band Trend Range Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS109\nFIGURE 9.7 USDJPY Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 9.8 GBPUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS1105. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\n5. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nHere are some examples:\nIn Figure 9.7, we see that USDJPY closed above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band on May 18. We check to see if the last two candles were below the\nband and the rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a long trade at 119.97. The\nstop is placed 65 pips below at 119.32. The target for the ﬁrst half of the position is\n50 pips, or 120.47, and the target for the second half is 195 pips, or 121.92. The\nﬁrst proﬁt target is reached 24 hours later (which is generally the case). When that\nhappens, the stop is raised to 119.97, which is the initial entry or breakeven price.\nThe trade is left on and the second proﬁt target of +195 pips is reached six trading\ndays after the trade was ﬁrst initiated.\nIn Figure 9.8, we see GBPUSD close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand on March 4, so we check to see if the last two candles were above the band and\nthe rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a short trade at 5pm when the currency\npair is trading at 1.5263. The stop is placed 65 pips above at 1.5328. The target for\nthe ﬁrst half of the position is 50 pips, or 1.5213, and the target for the second half\nis 195 pips, or 1.5068. The trade ﬂoats for 24 hours, then GBPUSD drops sharply,\nhitting our ﬁrst and second proﬁt target on the very same day.\nWe encourage you to lay the Bollinger Bands on your charts and look for more\nexamples of these strategies in action. There are many ways to use the double\nBollinger Bands for forex trading. Both of these strategies are for daily charts, but\ndifferent strategies and rules can be used for intraday trading using the bands.\n111CHAPTER 10\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Fading\nthe Double Zeros\nOne of the most widely overlooked areas of trading is market structure.\nDeveloping a keen understanding of market structure and its dynamics\ncan help day traders to gain an unbelievable advantage. Developing a feel and\nunderstanding for market dynamics is key to proﬁtably taking advantage of short-\nterm ﬂuctuations. In foreign exchange trading this is especially critical as the primary\ninﬂuence of intraday price action is order ﬂow. Given the fact that most individual\ntraders are not privy to sell-side bank order ﬂow, day traders looking to proﬁt from\nshort-term ﬂuctuations need to learn how to identify and anticipate price zones\nwhere large order ﬂows should be triggered. This technique is very efﬁcient for\nintraday traders as it allows them to get on the same side as the market maker.\nWhen trading intraday, it is impossible to look for bounces off every support or\nresistance level and expect to be proﬁtable. The key to successful intraday trading\nrequires more selectivity and only entering at those levels where a reaction is more\nlikely. Trading off psychologically important levels such as the double zeros or round\nnumbers is one good way of identifying such opportunities. Double zeros represent\nnumbers where the last two digits are zeros. Examples of double zeros would be\n118.00in USDJPY or 1.11 00in the EURUSD. After noticing how many times a\ncurrency pair would bounce off double zero support or resistance levels intraday\ndespite the underlying trend, we have observed that these bounces are usually much\nlarger and more relevant that rallies off other price levels. This type of reaction is\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS112perfect for intraday FX traders because it gives them the opportunity to make 30 to\n50 pips while risking only 15–20 pips.\nThis trading technique is not difﬁcult, but it requires individual traders to develop\na solid feel for dealing room and market participant psychology. The idea behind this\ndouble zero methodology is simple. Large banks with access to conditional order\nﬂow have a distinct advantage over other market participants. The bank’s order book\ngives them direct insight into potential reactions at different price levels. Dealers\nwill often use this strategic information to put on short-term positions in their own\naccounts.\nMarket participants as a whole tend to put conditional orders near or around\nthe same levels. While stop-loss orders are usually placed just beyond the round\nnumbers, traders will cluster their take proﬁt orders at the round number. The\nreason why this occurs is because traders are humans, and humans tend to think in\nround numbers. As a result, take proﬁt orders have a very high tendency of being\nplaced at the double zero level. Since the FX market is a 24-hour continuous market,\nspeculators also use stop and limit orders more frequently than in other markets.\nLarge banks with access to conditional order ﬂow, like stops and limits, actively seek\nto exploit this clustering of positions to basically gun stops. The fading the double zero\nstrategy attempts to put traders on the same side as market makers by positioning\ntraders for a quick contra-trend move at the double zero level.\nThis trade is most proﬁtable when there are other technical indicators that will\nconﬁrm the signiﬁcance of the double zero level. Here are some guidelines for fading\nthe double zeros or ‘‘round numbers.’’\n■Strategy Rules\nLong:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading below its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Enter a long position 10 to 15 pips above the ﬁgure.\n3. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips below the ﬁgure.\na. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to\nbreakeven.\nb. Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nShort:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading above its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Short the currency pair 10 to 15 pips below the ﬁgure.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS1133. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips above the round number.\n4. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount that you risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to breakeven.\nTrail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nMarket Conditions\nThis strategy works best when the move happens in quieter market conditions\nwithout the inﬂuence of major reports. It is more successful for currency pairs with\ntighter trading ranges, crosses, and commodity currencies. This strategy also works\nin the majors but under quieter market conditions since the stop loss is relatively\ntight.\nFurther Optimization\nRound numbers are important because they are signiﬁcant levels but if the price\ncoincides with a key technical level, a reversal becomes more likely. This means the\nstrategy has an even higher probability of success when other important support or\nresistance levels converge at the ﬁgure. This can be caused by moving averages, key\nFibonacci levels or Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some of the examples of this strategy in action. The ﬁrst\nexample that we will go over is a 15-minute chart of USDJPY shown in Figure 10.1.\nAccording to the rules of the strategy, we can see that on April 24, USDJPY was\ntrading above its 20-period moving. Prices continued to move higher with the\ncurrency pair drifting toward 120.00, our double zero level. In accordance with the\nrules, we place an entry order a few pips below the round number at 1110.85. Our\norder is triggered, and we put our stop 20 above the ﬁgure at 120.20. USDJPY\nclimbs to a high of 120.08 before turning lower. We close half of the position when\nit moves by the amount risked or 35 pips at 1110.50. Notice that USDJPY falls and\nthen rallies again before hitting our initial proﬁt target. When the ﬁrst proﬁt target\nis reached, the stop on the remaining half of the position is moved to breakeven or\nour initial entry price of 1110.85.\nWe then proceed to trail stop. The trailing stop can be done using a variety of\nmethods including a monetary or percentage basis. We choose to trail the stop by\ntwo-bar low for a really short-term trade and end up getting out of the other half of\nthe position at 1110.50 as well, earning us 35 pips on the ﬁrst and second half of the\npositions.\nThe next chart that we want to look at is GBPUSD. What’s interesting about\nFigure 10.2 is that there are a number of examples. In the ﬁrst example, labeled ‘‘1,’’\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS114\nFIGURE 10.1 USDJPY 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 10.2 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS115we can see that GBP/USD was trading above its 20-period moving average on a\n15-minute chart and headed for 1.55. According to our rules, we place an order to\nsell at 1.5485 (the high on this move was 1.5492) with a stop at 1.5520 for 35-pip\nrisk. GBPUSD moves in our favor, and our ﬁrst proﬁt target is hit at (1.5485 –.0035)\nat 1.5450. We then move our stop to breakeven, or our initial entry price of 1.5485,\nand proceed to trail it by the 20-day SMA +10 pips. If we manage our trade using\nthis type of trailing stop, the second half of the position would have been exited\nat 1.5350 for 35 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and 135 pips on the second.\nPart of the reason why this trade was so successful is because the 1.5500 is also\na signiﬁcant technical level. Example ‘‘2’’ is a long trail that reversed but not by\nenough to hit the proﬁt target. Example ‘‘3’’ is a successful long trade that hit the ﬁrst\nproﬁt target.\nMaking sure that the double zero level is a signiﬁcant level is a key element of\nﬁltering for good trades. The last example shown in Figure 10.3 is USDCAD on a\n15-minute chart. The great thing about this trade is that it is triple zero level rather\nthan just a double zero level. Triple zero levels hold even more signiﬁcance than a\ndouble zero level because of their less frequent occurrence. In Figure 10.3, we see\nthat USDCAD is also trading well below its 20-period moving average and heading\ntoward 1.2000. We look to go long 15 pips above the double zero level at 1.2015.\nFIGURE 10.3 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS116We place our stop 20 pips below the round number at 1.1980. The currency pair\nhits a low of 1.2011 before moving higher. We then sell half of our positions when\nthe currency pair rallies by the amount that we risked at 1.2050. The stop on the\nremaining half of the position is then moved to breakeven at 1.2015. We proceed\nto trail the stop once again by the two-bar low and end up exiting the second half\nof the position at 1.2055. As a result, we earned 35 pips on the ﬁrst position and\n40 pips on the second position.\n117CHAPTER 11\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Waiting\nfor the Deal\nThe lack of volume data in the FX market has forced day traders to develop\ndifferent strategies that rely less on the level of demand and more on the micro\nstructure of the market. One of the most common characteristics that day traders\ntry to exploit is the market’s 24-hour round-the-clock nature. Although the market\nis open for trading throughout the course of the day, the extent of market activity\nduring each trading session can vary signiﬁcantly. Traditionally, trading tends to be\nthe quietest during the Asian market hours as we indicated in Chapter 4. This means\nthat currencies such as the EURUSD and GBPUSD tend to trade within a very\ntight range during these hours. According to the Bank of International Settlement’s\nTriennial FX Survey published in September of 2014, the United Kingdom is the\nmost active trading center, capturing 41% of total volume. Adding in Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Switzerland, European trading as a whole accounts for 50% of\ntotal FX trading. The United States, on the other hand, is only second to the\nUnited Kingdom for the title of most active trading center, but that amounts to only\napproximately 19% of total turnover. This makes the London open exceptionally\nimportant because it gives the majority of traders in the market an opportunity\nto take advantage of events or announcements that may have occurred during\nlate U.S. trading or overnight Asian sessions. This becomes even more critical on\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL118days when the FOMC meets to discuss and announce monetary policy because the\nannouncement occurs at 2:15pm NY Time, after the London close.\nThe British pound trades most actively against the U.S. dollar during the European\nand London trading hours. There is also active trading during the U.S./European\noverlap, but outside those time frames, the pair tends to trade relatively lightly\nbecause the majority of GBPUSD trading is done through UK and European market\nmakers. This provides a great opportunity for day traders to capture the initial\ndirectional intraday real move that occurs within the ﬁrst few hours of London\ntrading. This strategy exploits the common perception that UK traders are notorious\nstop hunters. This means that the initial movement at the London open may not\nalways be the real one. Since UK and European dealers are the primary market\nmakers for the GBPUSD, they have tremendous insight into the extent of actual\nsupply and demand for the pair. The ‘‘waiting for the real deal’’ trading strategy\nﬁrst sets up when interbank dealing desks survey their books at the onset of trading\nand use their client data to trigger close stops on both sides of the markets to gain\nthe pip differential. Once these stops are taken out and the books are cleared, the\nreal directional move in the GBPUSD will begin to occur, at which point we look\nfor the rules of this strategy to be met before entering into a long or short position.\nThis strategy works best following the U.S. open or after a major economic release.\nWith this strategy, you are looking for th e noise in the markets to settle before\ntrading the real trend of the day.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Early European trading in GBPUSD begins around 1am NY Time, and we look\nfor the pair to make new range low of at least 25 pips above the opening price\n(the range is deﬁned as t he price action between the Frankfurt and London\npower hour of 6 GMT to 7 GMT NY Time).\n2. Look for the pair to reverse and penetrate the high.\n3. Place an entry order to buy 10 pips above the high of the range.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range high, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nShorts:\n1. GBPUSD opens in Europe and trades more than 25 pips above the high\nestablished during the Frankfurt to London power hour.\n2. Wait for the pair to reverse and penetrate the low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL1193. When that occurs, place an entry order to sell 10 pips below the low of the\nrange.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range low, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some examples of this strategy in action. Figure 11.1 is\na textbook example of the ‘‘waiting for th e real deal’’ strategy. Between 6 and 7\nGMT, the range high and low for GBPUSD are 1.5359 and 1.5234, respectively. At\nthe start of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upwards, taking\nout the range high of 1.5359. At the time, we place an order to sell GBPUSD 10\npips below the range low at 1.5324. The entry is triggered about an hour and a half\nlater. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35 pips total) at\n1.5359. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5274, or 50 pips below\nthe entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven\nor 1.5324. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at 1.5219\nshortly after the NY open.\nFIGURE 11.1 GBPUSD 5-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL120\nFIGURE 11.2 GBPUSD 10-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 11.3 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL121The next example is shown in Figure 11.2. In this example, the range high and\nlow established between 6 and 7 GMT are 1 .5433 and 1.5399, resp ectively. At the\nstart of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upward, taking out\nthe range high of 1.5433 and racing all the way to 1.5492. At the time, we place an\norder to sell GBPUSD 10 pips below the range low at 1.5389. The entry is triggered\naround the NY open. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35\npips total) at 1.5424. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5339, or 50\npips below the entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to\nbreakeven or 1.5389. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at\n1.5284 after the London open on the following trading day.\nThe third example is shown in Figure 11.3. In this example, the range during the\nFrankfurt London power hour is 1.5187 and 1.5139. At the start of the London\ntrading session, GBPUSD drips lower, breaking below the range low and trading\ndown to 1.5105. When the range low is broken, we place an order to buy GBPUSD\n10 pips below the range high at 1.5197. The entry is triggered around the NY open.\nThe protective stop is placed 25 pips below the range high (35 pips total) at 1.5172.\nA take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5247, or 50 pips below the entry\nprice. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or 1.5197.\nThe second exit is not shown in the chart in Figure 11.3, but the breakeven stop is\ntriggered."

        "101CHAPTER 9\nTechnical Strategy:\nTrading with\nDouble Bollinger\nBands\nOne of the most useful technical indicators in my experience is Bollinger Bands.\nTraditionally, Bollinger Bands are used as overbought and oversold indicators,\nbut given the trending nature of currencies, there are more efﬁcient ways to use the\nbands. Traditionally, Bollinger Bands consists of three lines—the 20-period moving\naverage and the two standard deviation bands above and below the moving average.\nIf the currency pair rises to the upper Bollinger Band, it is considered overbought\nbecause the move extended to an extreme level and should therefore be faded. The\nsame is true if it drops to the lower Bollinger Band. Unfortunately, currencies are\ntrending, and using the 20-period two standard deviation bands may not be the best\nway to trade. Take a look at Figure 9.1. In this daily chart of EURUSD, the arrows\nhighlight the points where the currency pair ‘‘hugs’’ the second standard deviation\nband. If you bought each time EURUSD touched the lower band or sold each time it\ntouched the upper band, there would be signiﬁcant losses before the currency pair\nﬁnally turned around.\nThe better technique would be to add another set of Bollinger Bands—the 20-\nperiod, one-standard deviation. This would put four bands on the chart if the basis\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS102\nFIGURE 9.1 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS103or the 20-period moving average is removed, and most charting packages will allow\nyou to do that. Figure 9.2 shows how the same EURUSD daily chart with look with\ntwo sets of Bollinger Bands. The outer lines are the two-standard-deviation Bollinger\nBands, and the two inner lines are the one-standard-deviation Bollinger Bands.\n■Using Double Bollinger Bands to Pick Tops\nand Bottoms\nHaving two sets of Bollinger Bands on your chart is a much more effective way\nto pick a top or bottom in currencies. The general rule of thumb is that we don’t\nbuy a bottom until the currency pair has traded above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. Along the same lines, we do not sell a top until the pair trades\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. While this technique may not\npick the perfect bottom, it can help avoid prematurely picking a top or bottom\nwhich can mean major losses in a trending environment. Here are the rules for the\nlong and short trades on a daily chart for picking tops and bottoms using the double\nBollinger Bands.\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be trading between the lower ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, BUY at close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 50 pips below ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to be tra ding between the upper ﬁrst and second\nstandard deviation Bollinger Bands.\n2. Look for a close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Stop 30 pips above ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band.\n5. Close half of position when it moves by amount risked; move stop on rest to\ninitial entry price (breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at two times risk or trail the stop.\nLets take a look at the same EURUSD chart. Figure 9.3 shows the points at which\na trade would have been entered, and in most cases, it was a more effective way to\npick a top or bottom in the currency pair.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS104\nFIGURE 9.2 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS\nk\nk105\nk\nk\nFIGURE 9.3 EURUSD Bollinger Band Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS106\nFIGURE 9.4 EURUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nNow let’s take a look at some examples in more detail. In Figure 9.4, we see that\non May 18, the EURUSD, which had been trading between the two upper bands,\nfell strongly to break out of the zone and close below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band. We sell at the NY close (there’s usually a leeway of two hours). A\ntwo-lot trade is established at 1.1313 with a stop 30 pips above the ﬁrst standard\ndeviation Bollinger Band (1.1341) at 1.1371. The risk is 58 pips, which means that\nthe ﬁrst exit is 1.1313 minus 58 pips or 1.1255. The second proﬁt target is 1.1197,\nwhich is two times risk or 116 pips. The ﬁrst and second proﬁt targets are reached\non the very next day when the currency pair drops to a low of 1.1119, for a proﬁt\nof 58 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and another 116 pips on the second half. If\nthe stop was trailed using a moving average or percentage, a trader may have been\nable to capitalize on th e selloff that ensued.\nFigure 9.5 shows that on June 2, the EURUSD, which had been trading between\nthe two lower bands, rose strongly to break out of the zone and close ﬁrmly above\nthe ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band. We buy at the NY close (there’s usually\na leeway of two hours). A two-lot trade is e stablished at 1.1151, with a stop 30 pips\nbelow the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Band (1.0970) at 1.0940. The risk is 211\npips, which means that the ﬁrst exit is 1.1151 plus 211 pips, or 1.1361. This proﬁt\ntarget is reached two days later, when the currency pair races to a high of 1.1380.\nAt the time, the stop is moved to 1.1151, and the following day the breakeven stop\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS107\n14:40 GMT April 19th\n1 Month To 1 Year Risk Reversal\nC u r r e n c y 1 MR / R 3 MR / R 6 MR / R 1 Y RR / R\nUSDJPY 0.3/0.6 :IC 0.7/1.0 JC 1.1/1.3 JC 1.3/1.6 JC\nEURUSD 0.1/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.0/0.3 EC 0.1/0.4 EC\nGBPUSD 0.0/0.3 SP 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC 0.0/0.3 SC\nUSDCHF 0.2/0.2 CC 0.0/0.3 CC. 0.0/0.4 CC 0.1/0.5 CC\n*J C =Japanese Yen Call * SC =Sterling Call\n*E C =Euro Call * CC =Swiss Call\n*S P =Sterling Put\nFIGURE 9.5 EURUSD Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nis hit, and we end up banking only +211 on the ﬁrst half of the trade with no losses\nor gains on the second half.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Determine Trend versus Range\nIn addition to identifying levels to pick tops and bottoms, the double Bollinger Bands\ncan also be very helpful in determining the market environment. One of the most\ncommonly asked questions in forex is whether a currency pair is in trend or range.\nWhen the pair is trading be tween the two lower or upper Bollinger Bands, it is in\ntrend, and when it is trading between the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger Bands,\nit is in range, as shown in Figure 9.6. When the currency pair is in trend mode,\nit is best to look for opportunities to join the trend. When it is in the range zone,\npicking tops and bottoms is preferred.\nUsing Double Bollinger Bands to Join a New Trend\nAnother way to use the double Bollinger Bands is to join a new uptrend or downtrend\nusing a daily chart. Here are the trading rules:\nStrategy Rules for Long Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close above the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were below the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, buyat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS108\nFIGURE 9.6 GBPUSD Bollinger Band Trend Range Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS109\nFIGURE 9.7 USDJPY Long Trade\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 9.8 GBPUSD Short Trade\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL STRATEGY: TRADIN G WITH DOUBLE BOLLINGER BANDS1105. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nStrategy Rules for Short Trade\n1. Look for the currency pair to close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand.\n2. Check to see if the last two candles were above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band.\n3. If so, sellat close of candle or 5pm NY Time.\n4. Initial stop at +65 pips.\n5. Close half of position at +50 pips; move stop on rest to initial entry price\n(breakeven).\n6. Close remainder of position at +195 pips.\nHere are some examples:\nIn Figure 9.7, we see that USDJPY closed above the ﬁrst standard deviation\nBollinger Band on May 18. We check to see if the last two candles were below the\nband and the rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a long trade at 119.97. The\nstop is placed 65 pips below at 119.32. The target for the ﬁrst half of the position is\n50 pips, or 120.47, and the target for the second half is 195 pips, or 121.92. The\nﬁrst proﬁt target is reached 24 hours later (which is generally the case). When that\nhappens, the stop is raised to 119.97, which is the initial entry or breakeven price.\nThe trade is left on and the second proﬁt target of +195 pips is reached six trading\ndays after the trade was ﬁrst initiated.\nIn Figure 9.8, we see GBPUSD close below the ﬁrst standard deviation Bollinger\nBand on March 4, so we check to see if the last two candles were above the band and\nthe rules are satisﬁed, allowing us to initiate a short trade at 5pm when the currency\npair is trading at 1.5263. The stop is placed 65 pips above at 1.5328. The target for\nthe ﬁrst half of the position is 50 pips, or 1.5213, and the target for the second half\nis 195 pips, or 1.5068. The trade ﬂoats for 24 hours, then GBPUSD drops sharply,\nhitting our ﬁrst and second proﬁt target on the very same day.\nWe encourage you to lay the Bollinger Bands on your charts and look for more\nexamples of these strategies in action. There are many ways to use the double\nBollinger Bands for forex trading. Both of these strategies are for daily charts, but\ndifferent strategies and rules can be used for intraday trading using the bands.\n111CHAPTER 10\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Fading\nthe Double Zeros\nOne of the most widely overlooked areas of trading is market structure.\nDeveloping a keen understanding of market structure and its dynamics\ncan help day traders to gain an unbelievable advantage. Developing a feel and\nunderstanding for market dynamics is key to proﬁtably taking advantage of short-\nterm ﬂuctuations. In foreign exchange trading this is especially critical as the primary\ninﬂuence of intraday price action is order ﬂow. Given the fact that most individual\ntraders are not privy to sell-side bank order ﬂow, day traders looking to proﬁt from\nshort-term ﬂuctuations need to learn how to identify and anticipate price zones\nwhere large order ﬂows should be triggered. This technique is very efﬁcient for\nintraday traders as it allows them to get on the same side as the market maker.\nWhen trading intraday, it is impossible to look for bounces off every support or\nresistance level and expect to be proﬁtable. The key to successful intraday trading\nrequires more selectivity and only entering at those levels where a reaction is more\nlikely. Trading off psychologically important levels such as the double zeros or round\nnumbers is one good way of identifying such opportunities. Double zeros represent\nnumbers where the last two digits are zeros. Examples of double zeros would be\n118.00in USDJPY or 1.11 00in the EURUSD. After noticing how many times a\ncurrency pair would bounce off double zero support or resistance levels intraday\ndespite the underlying trend, we have observed that these bounces are usually much\nlarger and more relevant that rallies off other price levels. This type of reaction is\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS112perfect for intraday FX traders because it gives them the opportunity to make 30 to\n50 pips while risking only 15–20 pips.\nThis trading technique is not difﬁcult, but it requires individual traders to develop\na solid feel for dealing room and market participant psychology. The idea behind this\ndouble zero methodology is simple. Large banks with access to conditional order\nﬂow have a distinct advantage over other market participants. The bank’s order book\ngives them direct insight into potential reactions at different price levels. Dealers\nwill often use this strategic information to put on short-term positions in their own\naccounts.\nMarket participants as a whole tend to put conditional orders near or around\nthe same levels. While stop-loss orders are usually placed just beyond the round\nnumbers, traders will cluster their take proﬁt orders at the round number. The\nreason why this occurs is because traders are humans, and humans tend to think in\nround numbers. As a result, take proﬁt orders have a very high tendency of being\nplaced at the double zero level. Since the FX market is a 24-hour continuous market,\nspeculators also use stop and limit orders more frequently than in other markets.\nLarge banks with access to conditional order ﬂow, like stops and limits, actively seek\nto exploit this clustering of positions to basically gun stops. The fading the double zero\nstrategy attempts to put traders on the same side as market makers by positioning\ntraders for a quick contra-trend move at the double zero level.\nThis trade is most proﬁtable when there are other technical indicators that will\nconﬁrm the signiﬁcance of the double zero level. Here are some guidelines for fading\nthe double zeros or ‘‘round numbers.’’\n■Strategy Rules\nLong:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading below its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Enter a long position 10 to 15 pips above the ﬁgure.\n3. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips below the ﬁgure.\na. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to\nbreakeven.\nb. Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nShort:\n1. Identify a currency pair that is trading above its intraday 20-period simple\nmoving average on a 15-minute chart.\n2. Short the currency pair 10 to 15 pips below the ﬁgure.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS1133. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips above the round number.\n4. When the position is proﬁtable by the amount that you risked, close half of the\nposition and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to breakeven.\nTrail your stop as the price moves in your favor.\nMarket Conditions\nThis strategy works best when the move happens in quieter market conditions\nwithout the inﬂuence of major reports. It is more successful for currency pairs with\ntighter trading ranges, crosses, and commodity currencies. This strategy also works\nin the majors but under quieter market conditions since the stop loss is relatively\ntight.\nFurther Optimization\nRound numbers are important because they are signiﬁcant levels but if the price\ncoincides with a key technical level, a reversal becomes more likely. This means the\nstrategy has an even higher probability of success when other important support or\nresistance levels converge at the ﬁgure. This can be caused by moving averages, key\nFibonacci levels or Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some of the examples of this strategy in action. The ﬁrst\nexample that we will go over is a 15-minute chart of USDJPY shown in Figure 10.1.\nAccording to the rules of the strategy, we can see that on April 24, USDJPY was\ntrading above its 20-period moving. Prices continued to move higher with the\ncurrency pair drifting toward 120.00, our double zero level. In accordance with the\nrules, we place an entry order a few pips below the round number at 1110.85. Our\norder is triggered, and we put our stop 20 above the ﬁgure at 120.20. USDJPY\nclimbs to a high of 120.08 before turning lower. We close half of the position when\nit moves by the amount risked or 35 pips at 1110.50. Notice that USDJPY falls and\nthen rallies again before hitting our initial proﬁt target. When the ﬁrst proﬁt target\nis reached, the stop on the remaining half of the position is moved to breakeven or\nour initial entry price of 1110.85.\nWe then proceed to trail stop. The trailing stop can be done using a variety of\nmethods including a monetary or percentage basis. We choose to trail the stop by\ntwo-bar low for a really short-term trade and end up getting out of the other half of\nthe position at 1110.50 as well, earning us 35 pips on the ﬁrst and second half of the\npositions.\nThe next chart that we want to look at is GBPUSD. What’s interesting about\nFigure 10.2 is that there are a number of examples. In the ﬁrst example, labeled ‘‘1,’’\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS114\nFIGURE 10.1 USDJPY 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 10.2 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS115we can see that GBP/USD was trading above its 20-period moving average on a\n15-minute chart and headed for 1.55. According to our rules, we place an order to\nsell at 1.5485 (the high on this move was 1.5492) with a stop at 1.5520 for 35-pip\nrisk. GBPUSD moves in our favor, and our ﬁrst proﬁt target is hit at (1.5485 –.0035)\nat 1.5450. We then move our stop to breakeven, or our initial entry price of 1.5485,\nand proceed to trail it by the 20-day SMA +10 pips. If we manage our trade using\nthis type of trailing stop, the second half of the position would have been exited\nat 1.5350 for 35 pips on the ﬁrst half of the position and 135 pips on the second.\nPart of the reason why this trade was so successful is because the 1.5500 is also\na signiﬁcant technical level. Example ‘‘2’’ is a long trail that reversed but not by\nenough to hit the proﬁt target. Example ‘‘3’’ is a successful long trade that hit the ﬁrst\nproﬁt target.\nMaking sure that the double zero level is a signiﬁcant level is a key element of\nﬁltering for good trades. The last example shown in Figure 10.3 is USDCAD on a\n15-minute chart. The great thing about this trade is that it is triple zero level rather\nthan just a double zero level. Triple zero levels hold even more signiﬁcance than a\ndouble zero level because of their less frequent occurrence. In Figure 10.3, we see\nthat USDCAD is also trading well below its 20-period moving average and heading\ntoward 1.2000. We look to go long 15 pips above the double zero level at 1.2015.\nFIGURE 10.3 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADING THE DOUBLE ZEROS116We place our stop 20 pips below the round number at 1.1980. The currency pair\nhits a low of 1.2011 before moving higher. We then sell half of our positions when\nthe currency pair rallies by the amount that we risked at 1.2050. The stop on the\nremaining half of the position is then moved to breakeven at 1.2015. We proceed\nto trail the stop once again by the two-bar low and end up exiting the second half\nof the position at 1.2055. As a result, we earned 35 pips on the ﬁrst position and\n40 pips on the second position.\n117CHAPTER 11\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Waiting\nfor the Deal\nThe lack of volume data in the FX market has forced day traders to develop\ndifferent strategies that rely less on the level of demand and more on the micro\nstructure of the market. One of the most common characteristics that day traders\ntry to exploit is the market’s 24-hour round-the-clock nature. Although the market\nis open for trading throughout the course of the day, the extent of market activity\nduring each trading session can vary signiﬁcantly. Traditionally, trading tends to be\nthe quietest during the Asian market hours as we indicated in Chapter 4. This means\nthat currencies such as the EURUSD and GBPUSD tend to trade within a very\ntight range during these hours. According to the Bank of International Settlement’s\nTriennial FX Survey published in September of 2014, the United Kingdom is the\nmost active trading center, capturing 41% of total volume. Adding in Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Switzerland, European trading as a whole accounts for 50% of\ntotal FX trading. The United States, on the other hand, is only second to the\nUnited Kingdom for the title of most active trading center, but that amounts to only\napproximately 19% of total turnover. This makes the London open exceptionally\nimportant because it gives the majority of traders in the market an opportunity\nto take advantage of events or announcements that may have occurred during\nlate U.S. trading or overnight Asian sessions. This becomes even more critical on\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL118days when the FOMC meets to discuss and announce monetary policy because the\nannouncement occurs at 2:15pm NY Time, after the London close.\nThe British pound trades most actively against the U.S. dollar during the European\nand London trading hours. There is also active trading during the U.S./European\noverlap, but outside those time frames, the pair tends to trade relatively lightly\nbecause the majority of GBPUSD trading is done through UK and European market\nmakers. This provides a great opportunity for day traders to capture the initial\ndirectional intraday real move that occurs within the ﬁrst few hours of London\ntrading. This strategy exploits the common perception that UK traders are notorious\nstop hunters. This means that the initial movement at the London open may not\nalways be the real one. Since UK and European dealers are the primary market\nmakers for the GBPUSD, they have tremendous insight into the extent of actual\nsupply and demand for the pair. The ‘‘waiting for the real deal’’ trading strategy\nﬁrst sets up when interbank dealing desks survey their books at the onset of trading\nand use their client data to trigger close stops on both sides of the markets to gain\nthe pip differential. Once these stops are taken out and the books are cleared, the\nreal directional move in the GBPUSD will begin to occur, at which point we look\nfor the rules of this strategy to be met before entering into a long or short position.\nThis strategy works best following the U.S. open or after a major economic release.\nWith this strategy, you are looking for th e noise in the markets to settle before\ntrading the real trend of the day.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Early European trading in GBPUSD begins around 1am NY Time, and we look\nfor the pair to make new range low of at least 25 pips above the opening price\n(the range is deﬁned as t he price action between the Frankfurt and London\npower hour of 6 GMT to 7 GMT NY Time).\n2. Look for the pair to reverse and penetrate the high.\n3. Place an entry order to buy 10 pips above the high of the range.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range high, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nShorts:\n1. GBPUSD opens in Europe and trades more than 25 pips above the high\nestablished during the Frankfurt to London power hour.\n2. Wait for the pair to reverse and penetrate the low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL1193. When that occurs, place an entry order to sell 10 pips below the low of the\nrange.\n4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range low, or 35\npips.\n5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on\nrest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.\nExamples\nNow let’s take a look at some examples of this strategy in action. Figure 11.1 is\na textbook example of the ‘‘waiting for th e real deal’’ strategy. Between 6 and 7\nGMT, the range high and low for GBPUSD are 1.5359 and 1.5234, respectively. At\nthe start of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upwards, taking\nout the range high of 1.5359. At the time, we place an order to sell GBPUSD 10\npips below the range low at 1.5324. The entry is triggered about an hour and a half\nlater. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35 pips total) at\n1.5359. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5274, or 50 pips below\nthe entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven\nor 1.5324. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at 1.5219\nshortly after the NY open.\nFIGURE 11.1 GBPUSD 5-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL120\nFIGURE 11.2 GBPUSD 10-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 11.3 GBPUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEG Y: WAITING FOR THE DEAL121The next example is shown in Figure 11.2. In this example, the range high and\nlow established between 6 and 7 GMT are 1 .5433 and 1.5399, resp ectively. At the\nstart of the London trading session, we see GBPUSD squeeze upward, taking out\nthe range high of 1.5433 and racing all the way to 1.5492. At the time, we place an\norder to sell GBPUSD 10 pips below the range low at 1.5389. The entry is triggered\naround the NY open. The protective stop is placed 25 pips above the range low (35\npips total) at 1.5424. A take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5339, or 50\npips below the entry price. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to\nbreakeven or 1.5389. The second half of the position is exited at three times risk at\n1.5284 after the London open on the following trading day.\nThe third example is shown in Figure 11.3. In this example, the range during the\nFrankfurt London power hour is 1.5187 and 1.5139. At the start of the London\ntrading session, GBPUSD drips lower, breaking below the range low and trading\ndown to 1.5105. When the range low is broken, we place an order to buy GBPUSD\n10 pips below the range high at 1.5197. The entry is triggered around the NY open.\nThe protective stop is placed 25 pips below the range high (35 pips total) at 1.5172.\nA take proﬁt on half of the position is placed at 1.5247, or 50 pips below the entry\nprice. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or 1.5197.\nThe second exit is not shown in the chart in Figure 11.3, but the breakeven stop is\ntriggered."

        "123CHAPTER 12\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Inside\nDays Breakout Play\nThroughout this book, volatility trading has been discussed as one of the most\npopular strategies employed by professional traders. There are many ways to\ninterpret changes in volatilities, but one of the simplest strategies is actually a visual\none that requires nothing more than a keen eye. Although this is a strategy that is\nvery popular in the world of professional trading, new traders are frequently amazed\nby its ease, accuracy, and reliability. Breakout traders can identify inside days with\nnothing more than a basic candlestick chart.\nAn inside day is deﬁned as a day where the daily range has been contained within\nthe prior day’s trading range, or in other words, the day’s high and low do not\nexceed the previous day’s high and low. There needs to be at least two inside days\nbefore the volatility play can be implemented. The more inside days, the higher the\nlikelihood of an upside surge in volatility, or a breakout. This type of strategy is best\nemployed on daily charts, but the longer the time frame, the more signiﬁcant the\nbreakout opportunity. Some traders use the inside day strategy on hourly charts,\nwhich works to some success, but identifying inside days on daily charts tends to\nlead to an even greater probability of success. For day traders looking for inside days\non hourly charts, chances of a solid breakout increases if the contraction precedes\nthe London or U.S. market opens. The key is to predict a valid breakout and not\nget caught in a false breakout move. Traders using the daily charts could look for\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY124breakouts ahead of major economic releases for the speciﬁc currency pair. This\nstrategy works with all currencies pairs, but has less frequent instances of false\nbreakouts in the tighter range pairs such as the EURGBP, USDCAD, EURCHF,\nEURCAD, and AUDCAD.\n■Strategy Rules\nLong:\n1. Identify a currency pair where the daily range has been contained within the\nprior day’s range for at least two days (we are looking for multiple inside days).\n2. Buy 10 pips above the high of the previous inside day.\n3. Place stop and reverse order for two lots at least 10 pips below the low of the\nnearest inside day.\n4. Take proﬁt when prices reach double the amount risked or begin to trail stop\nat that level.\nProtect against false breakouts : If the stop and reverse order is triggered, place a stop\nat least 10 pips above the high of the nearest inside day and protect any proﬁts larger\nthan what you risked with a trailing stop.\nShort:\n1. Identify a currency pair where the daily range has been contained within the\nprior day’s range for at least two days (we are looking for multiple inside days).\n2. Sell 10 pips below the low of the previous inside day.\n3. Place stop and reverse order for two lots at least 10 pips above the high of the\nnearest inside day.\n4. Take proﬁt when prices reach double the amount risked or begin to trail stop\nat that level.\nProtect against false breakouts : If the stop and reverse order is triggered, place a stop\nat least 10 pips below the low of the nearest inside day and protect any proﬁts larger\nthan what you risked with a trailing stop.\nFurther Optimization\nFor higher-probability trades, technical formations can be used in conjunction with\nthe visual identiﬁcation to place a higher weight on a speciﬁc direction of the\nbreakout. For example, if the inside days are building and contracting toward the\ntop of a recent range such as a bullish ascending triangle formation, the breakout has\na higher likelihood of occurring to the upside. The opposite scenario is also true; if\ninside days are building and contracting toward the bottom of a recent range and\nwe begin to see that a bearish descending triangle is forming, the breakout has a\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY125higher likelihood of occurring to the downside. Aside from triangles, other technical\nfactors that can be considered include signiﬁcant support and resistance levels. For\nexample, if there are signiﬁcant Fibonacci and moving average support zones resting\nbelow the inside day levels, this either supports a higher likelihood of an upside\nbreakout or at least a higher probability of a false breakout to the downside.\nExamples\nLet us take a look at a few examples. Figure 12.1 is a daily chart of euro against the\nBritish pound, or the EURGBP. The two inside days are identiﬁed on the chart, and\nit is clear visually that each of those days’ ranges, which includes the high and low, is\ncontained within the previous day’s range. In accordance with our rules, we place\nan order to go long 10 pips above the high on the previous inside at 0.6634 and an\norder to sell 10 pips below the low of the previous inside day at 0.6579. Our long\norder gets triggered two bars after the most recent inside day. We then proceed\nto place a stop and reverse order 10 pips below the low of the most recent inside\nday at 0.6579. So basically, we went long at 0.6634 with a stop at 0.6579, which\nmeans that we are risking 45 pips. When prices reached our target level of double\nthe amount risked (90 pips), or 0.6724, we have two choices: to either close out the\nentire trade or begin trailing the stop. More conservative traders should probably\nsquare positions at this point, while more aggressive traders could look for more\n0.6724 Hit\non This Day\nBreaks High\nof Previous\nInside Day\nInside\nDays\nFIGURE 12.1 EURGBP Inside Day Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY126\nInside Days\nStop and Reverse\nOrder Triggered\nStop moved to\nBreakeven\n@0.6560\nFIGURE 12.2 NZDUSD Inside Day Chart\nSource: eSignal\nproﬁt potential. We choose to close out the trade for a 90-pip proﬁt, but those who\nstayed in and weathered a bit of volatility could have taken advantage of another 100\npips of proﬁts three weeks later.\nFigure 12.2 is another example of inside day trading using the daily chart of\nthe New Zealand dollar against the U.S. dollar (or the NZDUSD). The difference\nbetween this example and the previous one is that our stop and reverse order\nactually gets triggered, indicating that the ﬁrst move was a false breakout. The two\ninside days are labeled on the chart. In accordance with our rules, after identifying\nthe inside days, we place an order to buy on the break of the high of the previous\ninside day and an order to sell on the break of the low of the previous inside day.\nThe high on the ﬁrst or previous inside day is 0.6628. This means we place an order\nto go long at 0.6638 or to go short at 0.6618. Our long order gets triggered on\nthe ﬁrst day of the break at 0.6638, and we place a stop and reverse order 10 pips\nbelow the low of most recent inside day (or the daily candle before the breakout),\nwhich is 0.6560. However, instead of continuing the breakout, the pair reverses\nand we close our ﬁrst position at 0.6560 with a 78 pips loss. We then enter into a\nnew short position with the reverse order at 0.6560. The new stop is then 10 pips\nabove the high of the most recent inside day at 0.6619.

        "123CHAPTER 12\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Inside\nDays Breakout Play\nThroughout this book, volatility trading has been discussed as one of the most\npopular strategies employed by professional traders. There are many ways to\ninterpret changes in volatilities, but one of the simplest strategies is actually a visual\none that requires nothing more than a keen eye. Although this is a strategy that is\nvery popular in the world of professional trading, new traders are frequently amazed\nby its ease, accuracy, and reliability. Breakout traders can identify inside days with\nnothing more than a basic candlestick chart.\nAn inside day is deﬁned as a day where the daily range has been contained within\nthe prior day’s trading range, or in other words, the day’s high and low do not\nexceed the previous day’s high and low. There needs to be at least two inside days\nbefore the volatility play can be implemented. The more inside days, the higher the\nlikelihood of an upside surge in volatility, or a breakout. This type of strategy is best\nemployed on daily charts, but the longer the time frame, the more signiﬁcant the\nbreakout opportunity. Some traders use the inside day strategy on hourly charts,\nwhich works to some success, but identifying inside days on daily charts tends to\nlead to an even greater probability of success. For day traders looking for inside days\non hourly charts, chances of a solid breakout increases if the contraction precedes\nthe London or U.S. market opens. The key is to predict a valid breakout and not\nget caught in a false breakout move. Traders using the daily charts could look for\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY124breakouts ahead of major economic releases for the speciﬁc currency pair. This\nstrategy works with all currencies pairs, but has less frequent instances of false\nbreakouts in the tighter range pairs such as the EURGBP, USDCAD, EURCHF,\nEURCAD, and AUDCAD.\n■Strategy Rules\nLong:\n1. Identify a currency pair where the daily range has been contained within the\nprior day’s range for at least two days (we are looking for multiple inside days).\n2. Buy 10 pips above the high of the previous inside day.\n3. Place stop and reverse order for two lots at least 10 pips below the low of the\nnearest inside day.\n4. Take proﬁt when prices reach double the amount risked or begin to trail stop\nat that level.\nProtect against false breakouts : If the stop and reverse order is triggered, place a stop\nat least 10 pips above the high of the nearest inside day and protect any proﬁts larger\nthan what you risked with a trailing stop.\nShort:\n1. Identify a currency pair where the daily range has been contained within the\nprior day’s range for at least two days (we are looking for multiple inside days).\n2. Sell 10 pips below the low of the previous inside day.\n3. Place stop and reverse order for two lots at least 10 pips above the high of the\nnearest inside day.\n4. Take proﬁt when prices reach double the amount risked or begin to trail stop\nat that level.\nProtect against false breakouts : If the stop and reverse order is triggered, place a stop\nat least 10 pips below the low of the nearest inside day and protect any proﬁts larger\nthan what you risked with a trailing stop.\nFurther Optimization\nFor higher-probability trades, technical formations can be used in conjunction with\nthe visual identiﬁcation to place a higher weight on a speciﬁc direction of the\nbreakout. For example, if the inside days are building and contracting toward the\ntop of a recent range such as a bullish ascending triangle formation, the breakout has\na higher likelihood of occurring to the upside. The opposite scenario is also true; if\ninside days are building and contracting toward the bottom of a recent range and\nwe begin to see that a bearish descending triangle is forming, the breakout has a\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY125higher likelihood of occurring to the downside. Aside from triangles, other technical\nfactors that can be considered include signiﬁcant support and resistance levels. For\nexample, if there are signiﬁcant Fibonacci and moving average support zones resting\nbelow the inside day levels, this either supports a higher likelihood of an upside\nbreakout or at least a higher probability of a false breakout to the downside.\nExamples\nLet us take a look at a few examples. Figure 12.1 is a daily chart of euro against the\nBritish pound, or the EURGBP. The two inside days are identiﬁed on the chart, and\nit is clear visually that each of those days’ ranges, which includes the high and low, is\ncontained within the previous day’s range. In accordance with our rules, we place\nan order to go long 10 pips above the high on the previous inside at 0.6634 and an\norder to sell 10 pips below the low of the previous inside day at 0.6579. Our long\norder gets triggered two bars after the most recent inside day. We then proceed\nto place a stop and reverse order 10 pips below the low of the most recent inside\nday at 0.6579. So basically, we went long at 0.6634 with a stop at 0.6579, which\nmeans that we are risking 45 pips. When prices reached our target level of double\nthe amount risked (90 pips), or 0.6724, we have two choices: to either close out the\nentire trade or begin trailing the stop. More conservative traders should probably\nsquare positions at this point, while more aggressive traders could look for more\n0.6724 Hit\non This Day\nBreaks High\nof Previous\nInside Day\nInside\nDays\nFIGURE 12.1 EURGBP Inside Day Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY126\nInside Days\nStop and Reverse\nOrder Triggered\nStop moved to\nBreakeven\n@0.6560\nFIGURE 12.2 NZDUSD Inside Day Chart\nSource: eSignal\nproﬁt potential. We choose to close out the trade for a 90-pip proﬁt, but those who\nstayed in and weathered a bit of volatility could have taken advantage of another 100\npips of proﬁts three weeks later.\nFigure 12.2 is another example of inside day trading using the daily chart of\nthe New Zealand dollar against the U.S. dollar (or the NZDUSD). The difference\nbetween this example and the previous one is that our stop and reverse order\nactually gets triggered, indicating that the ﬁrst move was a false breakout. The two\ninside days are labeled on the chart. In accordance with our rules, after identifying\nthe inside days, we place an order to buy on the break of the high of the previous\ninside day and an order to sell on the break of the low of the previous inside day.\nThe high on the ﬁrst or previous inside day is 0.6628. This means we place an order\nto go long at 0.6638 or to go short at 0.6618. Our long order gets triggered on\nthe ﬁrst day of the break at 0.6638, and we place a stop and reverse order 10 pips\nbelow the low of most recent inside day (or the daily candle before the breakout),\nwhich is 0.6560. However, instead of continuing the breakout, the pair reverses\nand we close our ﬁrst position at 0.6560 with a 78 pips loss. We then enter into a\nnew short position with the reverse order at 0.6560. The new stop is then 10 pips\nabove the high of the most recent inside day at 0.6619. When NZDUSD moves by\ndouble the initial amount risked, conservative traders can take proﬁt on the entire\nposition while aggressive traders can trail the stop using various methods that might\ndepend on how wide the trading range is. In this example, since the daily trading\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: INSIDE DAYS BREAKOUT PLAY127\nTrade Exited\nInside Days\nTrade\nTriggered\nFIGURE 12.3 EURCAD Inside Day Chart\nSource: eSignal\nrange is fairly wide, we choose to close the position once the price reaches our limit\nof 0.6404 for a proﬁt of 156 pips and a total proﬁt on the entire trade of 78 pips.\nThe last example uses technicals to help determine a directional bias of the inside\nday breakout.

        "129CHAPTER 13\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Fader\nMore often than not, traders will ﬁnd themselves faced with a potential breakout\nscenario, position for it, and then only end up seeing the trade fail miserably\nand have prices revert back to range trading. In fact, even if prices manage to break\nabove a signiﬁcant level, a continuation move is not guaranteed. If this level is\nvery signiﬁcant, we frequently see interbank dealers or other traders try to push\nprices beyond those levels momentarily in order to run stops. Breakout levels are\nvery signiﬁcant levels and for this very reason, there is no hard fast rule as to\nhow much force is needed to carry prices beyond levels into a sustainable trend.\nTrading breakouts at key levels can involve a lot of risk and as a result, false\nbreakouts appear more frequently than real breakouts. Sometimes prices will test\nthe resistance level once, twice, or even three times before breaking out. This\nhas fostered the development of a large degree of contra-trend traders who look\nonly to fade breakouts in the currency markets. Yet fading every breakout can also\nresult in some signiﬁcant losses because once a real breakout occurs, the trend is\ngenerally strong and long-lasting. So what this boils down to is that traders need a\nmethodology for screening out consolidation patterns for trades that have a higher\npotential of resulting in a false breakout. The following rules provide a good basis\nfor screening such trades. The fader strate gy is a variation of the ‘‘waiting for the\nreal deal’’ strategy. It uses the daily charts to identify the range-bound environment\nand the hourly charts to pinpoint entry levels.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADER130■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Locate a currency pair whose 14-day ADX is less than 20. Ideally, the ADX\nshould also be trending downward, indicating that the trend is weakening\nfurther\n2. Wait for the market to break below the previous day’s low by at least 15 pips.\n3. Place an entry order to buy a few ticks above the previous day’s high.\n4. After getting ﬁlled, place your initial stop no more than 20 pips away.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of position when prices increase by the amount you risked;\nmove stop on remaining position to breakeven.\n6. Trail the stop on the remaining position.\nShorts:\n1. Locate a currency pair whose 14-day ADX is less than 20. Ideally the ADX\nshould also be trending downward, indicating that the trend is weakening\nfurther\n2. Look for a move above the previous day’s high by at least 15 pips.\n3. Place an entry order to sell a few ticks below the previous day’s low.\n4. Once ﬁlled, place the initial protective stop no more than 20-pips below your\nentry.\n5. Protect any proﬁts by selling half of the position when it runs 20 pips in your\nfavor.\n6. Place a trailing stop on the remainder of the position.\nExamples\nLet’s start by taking a look at an example to the short side. Figure 13.1 shows a\ndaily chart of USDJPY with the ADX below 20 and pointing downward. This is the\nﬁrst signal that a trade setup is in place. In this example, the previous day’s high\nis 120.27. We ﬁrst look for a move above the previous day’s high by at least 15\npips, or 120.42. As shown in Figure 13.2 the hourly chart, that move occurs at the\nstart of the European session after which we place an order to sell 5 pips below the\nprevious day’s low of 120.00. The order is ﬁlled a few hours later at 119.95. At the\ntime, we place our stop at 120.15 and a ﬁrst target of 119.75. The ﬁrst target is\nreached, and the stop on the rest of the position is moved to breakeven or 119.95.\nIn this example, the second half of the trade remains live and will either be closed at\nbreakeven, or the stop will be trailed.\nNow let’s take a look at an example to the long side. Figure 13.3 shows a daily\nchart of EURUSD with the ADX below 20 and pointing downward. This is the\nﬁrst signal that a trade setup is in place. In this example, the previous day’s high is\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADER131\nFIGURE 13.1 USDJPY Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 13.2 USDJPY 60-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADER132\nFIGURE 13.3 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 13.4 EURUSD 60-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADER1331.0801, and the low is 1.0708. We see that the low is broken ﬁrst, and when that\nhappens we place an order to buy 5 pips above the previous days high at 1.0806.\nAs shown in Figure 13.4, the order is triggered about 7 hours later. At the time,\nwe place our stop at 1.0786 and a ﬁrst target of 1.0826. The ﬁrst target is reached\nshortly after, and the stop on the rest of the position is moved to breakeven, or\n1.0806. In this example, if we trail the stop on the position using a two-bar low, the\nsecond half of the trade is closed at 1.0818.\nFurther Optimization\nThe false breakout strategy works best when there are no signiﬁcant economic\nreports scheduled for release that could trigger sharp unexpected movements.\nFor example, prices often consolidate ahead of the U.S. nonfarm payrolls release.\nGenerally speaking, they are consolidating for a reason, and that reason is because\nthe market is undecided and is either positioned already or wants to wait to react\nfollowing that release. Either way, there is a higher likelihood that any breakout on\nthe back of those releases would be a real one and not one that you want to fade.\nThis strategy works best with currency pairs that are less volatile and have narrower\ntrading ranges."

        "135CHAPTER 14\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: 20-Day\nBreakout Trade\nTrading breakouts can be both a rewarding and frustrating endeavor as breakouts\nhave a tendency to fail. A major reason why this can occur frequently in the\nforeign exchange market is because it is more technically driven than others and as a\nresult, there are many market participants who intentionally look to break pairs out\nin order to ‘‘suck’’ in other nonsuspecting traders. In an effort to ﬁlter out potential\nfalse breakouts, a price action screener should be used to identify breakouts that\nhave a higher probability of success. The rules behind this strategy are speciﬁcally\ndeveloped to take advantage of strong trending markets that make new highs that\nthen proceed to ‘‘fail’’ by taking out a recent low and then reverse again to make\nanother new high. This type of setup tends to have a very high success rate as it\nallows traders to enter strong trending markets after weaker players have been\nﬂushed out, only to have real money players reenter the market and push the pair\nup to new highs.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day high.\n2. Look for the pair to reverse the same day or next to make a two-day low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE1363. Buy the pair if it takes out the 20-day high within three days of making the\ntwo-day low.\n4. Place the initial stop a few pips below the two-day low.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nShorts:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day low.\n2. That day or the next the pair rallies to make a two-day high.\n3. Sell the pair if it trades below the 20-day low within three days of making the\ntwo-day high.\n4. Risk up to a few ticks above the two-day high.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nExamples\nNow take a look at our ﬁrst example in Figure 14.1. The daily chart of GBPUSD\nshows the currency pair making a new 20-day high on February 5. At this point,\nthe currency pair is on our radar, and we watch for a new two-day low to be made\nFIGURE 14.1 GBPUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE137within the next three days. This occurs right on schedule after which we wait for\nthe currency pair to make a new 20-day high, which occurs on February 12. At the\ntime, we buy GBPUSD a few pips above the previous 20-day high of 1.5352. We\nenter at 1.5360. The stop is placed a few pips below the original two-day low of\n1.5197 (or 1.5190). As the currency pair moves in our favor, we look to exit half\nof the position when it moves by the amount that we risked, which is 155 pips or\n1.5507. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or the\ninitial entry price of 1.5352. This rest of the trade is exited 24 hours later.\nFigure 14.2 provides an example of how the strategy can work in the EURUSD\nto the short side. On December 23, the currency pair makes a new 20-day low of\n1.2165. It goes on radar and we start looking for the currency pair to rebound within\nthe next three days. The recovery occurs the following day, and a new two-day\nhigh is made. Then we look for the previous 20-day low to be broken within the\nfollowing three days and that occurs shortly thereafter. At which point we enter\na short EURUSD trade at 1.2155 with a stop at 1.2260, or a few pips above the\ntwo-day high of 1.2254. Our risk on the trade is 105 pips. When the currency pair\ndrops to 1.2050, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. Then we trail the stop using a 2-bar high and end up exiting the\nremainder of the position at 1.1846.\nThe ﬁnal example shown in Figure 14.3 is in AUDUSD. The currency starts by\nmaking a new 20-day low on January 26. It goes on radar and we start looking\nfor the currency pair to rebound within the next three days. The recovery occurs\nFIGURE 14.2 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE138\nFIGURE 14.3 AUDUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nintraday, and a new two-day high is made right on schedule. Then we look for the\nprevious 20-day low to be broken within the following three days it occurs 24 hours\nafter the two-day high is made. At which point we enter a short AUDUSD trade a\nfew pips below the 20-day low at 0.7850 with a stop at 0.8032, or a few pips above\nthe two-day high of 0.8025. Our risk on the trade is 182 pips. When the currency\npair drops to 0.7668, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. The breakeven stop is triggered the very same day that the ﬁrst\ntarget is reached.\n139CHAPTER 15\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Channels\nChannel trading is a less exotic but popular trading technique for currencies. The\nreason why it can work is because currencies rarely spend much time in tight\ntrading ranges and have the tendency to develop strong trends. By reviewing a few\ncharts, traders can see that channels can easily be identiﬁed and occur frequently.\nA common scenario would be channel trading during the Asian session and a\nbreakout in either the London or U.S. session. There are many instances where\neconomic releases are one of the most common triggers for a break of the channel.\nTherefore, it is imperative that traders keep on top of economic releases. If a channel\nhas formed and a big U.S. number (per say) is expected to be released, and the\ncurrency pair is at the top of a channel, the probability of a break is high, so traders\nshould be looking to buy the break out, not fade it.\nChannels are created when we draw a trendline, and then draw a line that is\nparallel to that trendline. Most if not all of the price activity of the currency pair\nshould fall between the two channel lines. We will seek to identify situations where\nthe price is trading within a narrow channel, and then trade in the direction of a\nbreakout from the channel. This strategy can be particularly effective when used\nprior to a fundamental market event such as the release of major economic news, or\nprior to the ‘‘open’’ of a major ﬁnancial market.\nHere are some rules for using this technique to ﬁnd long trades:\n1. First, identify a channel on either an intraday or daily chart. The price should\nbe contained within a narrow range.\n2. Enter long as the price breaks above the upper channel line by 10 pips.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS1403. Place a stop at the lower channel line.\n4. Exit the position when it moves by double the amount risked.\nThe short rules are the reverse.\n■Examples\nLet examine a few examples. The ﬁrst example is a USDCAD 15-minute chart\nshown in Figure 15.1. The total range of the channel is approximately 30 pips with\nthe low being 1.2028 and the high 1.2056. In accordance with our strategy, we\nplace entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at 1.2018 and 1.2066. The\norder to buy gets triggered ﬁrst, and almost immediately we place a stop order\nat the low of the channel or 1.2028, which means we are risking 38 pips on the\ntrade. USDCAD then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of double the range at\n1.2142. More conservative traders could exit half of the position when it moves by\nthe amount risked, or 38 pips, and trail the stop on the remainder of the position.\nThe next example shown in Figure 15.2 is a 15-minute chart of EURGBP. The\ntotal range between the two lines is 12 p ips with the low being 0.7148 and the high\n0.7160. In accordance with our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and\nbelow the channel at 0.7138 and 0.7170. The order to buy gets triggered ﬁrst and\nalmost immediately we place a stop at the low of the channel or 0.7160 for 10-pip\nrisk. EURGBP then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of 20 pips or double\nthe amount risked.\nFIGURE 15.1 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS141\nFIGURE 15.2 EURGBP 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 15.3 EURUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFigure 15.3 is a 15-minute chart of the EURUSD. The total range during this\nfour-hour period is 18 pips with a high of 1.1206 and a low of 1.1188. In accordance\nwith our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at\n1.1216 and 1.1178. The order to sell gets triggered ﬁrst and almost immediately,\nwe place a stop order at the channel high of 1.1206 for a risk of 28 pips. The\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS142EURUSD then proceeds to sell off signiﬁcantly but only makes it to a low of 1.1132\nbefore stopping us out a few days later. We chose to show this example because it\nexplains why the more conservative approach of exiting half of the position when it\nmoves by the amount risk is more desirable, even though it has worse risk reward.\nA move of 58 pips is sizable on an intraday basis and may be difﬁcult to achieve.\nWhenever the risk is greater than 20 pips, it may be more prudent to exit half and\ntrail the stop.\n143CHAPTER 16\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Perfect\nOrder\nAperfect order in moving averages is deﬁned as a set of moving averages that\nis in sequential order. For an uptrend, a perfect order would be a situation\nin which the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) is at a higher price level than\nthe 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 50-day SMA. Meanwhile, the 100-day\nSMA would be below the 50-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA would be below\nthe 100-day SMA. In a downtrend, the opposite is true, where the 200-day SMA is\nat the highest level and the 10-day SMA is at the lowest level. Having the moving\naverages stacked up in sequential order are generally a strong indicator of a trending\nenvironment. Not only does it indicate that the momentum is on the side of trend,\nbut the moving averages also serve as multiple levels of support. To optimize the\nperfect order strategy, traders should also look for ADX to be greater than 20 and\ntrending upward. This represents a strong trend. Entry and exit levels are difﬁcult\nto determine with this strategy, but genera l l ys p e a k i n g ,w ew a n tt os t a yi nt h et r a d e\nfor as long as the perfect order remains in place and exit once the perfect order no\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER144longer holds. Perfect orders do not happen often, and the premise of this strategy is\nto capture the perfect order when it ﬁrst happens.\nThe perfect order seeks to take advantage of a trending environment near the\nbeginning of the trend:\n1. Look for a currency pair with moving averages in perfect order.\n2. Look for ADX pointing upwards, ideally greater than 20.\n3. Buy ﬁve candles after the initial formation of the perfect order (if it still\nholds).\n4. Initial stop is the low on the day of the initial crossover for longs and the high\nfor shorts.\n5. Exit the position when the perfect order no longer holds.\n■Examples\nFigure 16.1 is a daily chart of the EURUSD. In August 2014, the moving averages\nin the EURUSD formed a sequential perfect order. We check and see that ADX is\ngreater than 20, and we look to enter into a short trade ﬁve candles after the initial\nformation at 1.3390. Our initial stop is placed at the August 8 high of 1.3432. The\npair continues to move lower in the days and weeks that follow, and we remain in\nthe trade until the moving averages are no longer in perfect and the 10-day SMA\nmoves above the 20-day SMA, which occurs on October 17 when EURUSD settles\nthe day at 1.2758. The total proﬁt on this trade is 632 pips. We risked 42 pips on\nthe trade.\nThe next example is USDSGD. In Figure 16.2, the perfect order forms on\nNovember 6. We check and see that ADX is greater than 20, and we look to enter\ninto a long trade ﬁve candles after the initial formation at 1.2916. Our stop should\nbe at the November 6 low of 1.2911 but that is below our entry price so we put\nour stop at the 20-day SMA of 1.2822. The pair continues to move higher in the\nmonths that follow, and we remain in the trade until the moving averages are no\nlonger in perfect and the 10-day SMA moves below the 20-day SMA, which occurs\non March 27, when USD/SGD closes the day at 1.3685. The total move on this\ntrade is 770 pips for a risk of 89 pips.\nFigure 16.3 shows a perfect-order formation on a daily chart in USDJPY. The\nperfect order formed in October and when that occurred, we entered the trade\nﬁve days afterward at 116.20. Our stop was placed at 108.75, and we remained in\nthe trade until the 10-day SMA crossed below the 20-day SMA on December 19 at\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk145\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.1 EURUSD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk146\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.2 USDSGD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk147\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.3 USDJPY Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER148119.45. In this example, the proﬁt was 425 pips for a risk of 645 pips, which was\nfar from ideal.\nThe perfect order is a strategy that can be high proﬁt but low probability and\nlow frequency. This means there could be numerous stop outs before a long trend\nemerges. Also, when the currency pair moves more than 250 to 300 pips in proﬁt,\nyou may want to consider taking proﬁt on part of the positions.\n149CHAPTER 17\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nPairing Strong with\nWeak\nOne of the best ways to approach currency trading on a fundamental basis\nis to pair the strongest currency with the weakest. Of course ﬁnding that\npairing is rarely simple because it is not just about which countries are the strongest\nor weakest right now but instead which ones will become strong or weak going\nforward. Finding these currencies can also be challenging because we live in a global\neconomy where the health of one major economy will affect the outlook of another.\nYet buying a weak currency and selling a strong one unknowingly can be a big\nmistake that translates into large losses, so it is extremely important for forex traders\nto learn how to pair strong with weak to maximize returns. After doing so you can\nuse technical analysis to help identify points of entry in the direction of the trend.\nIn 2015, for example, the European Central Bank introduced quantitative easing\n(QE) as a last ditch effort to boost inﬂation and stimulate growth. We know that\nQE lowers interest rates and erodes the value of a currency but selling euros blindly\non March 9, 2015, when the central bank started buying bonds for the very ﬁrst\ntime, yielded only a short-lived decline in the currency. Instead it would have been\nsmarter to look for opportunities to sell the currency against a strong one on rallies.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK150\nFIGURE 17.1 EURGBP Daily Chart—Quantitative Easing\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 17.2 NZDCAD Daily Chart—Oil\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK151One good candidate at the time was the British pound, which was beneﬁting from\neconomic improvements and had a central bank that was moving closer to raising\nrates. Figure 17.1 shows how there was a lot of consolidation in EURGBP near\n74 cents prior to the launch of Eurozone quantitative easing. This level proved to\nbe resistance when the pair rallied in late March. Traders could have sold them,\nassuming that resistance would hold, or waited for the pair to revisit that level in\nApril and May.\nAnother way to pair strong with weak is to follow the direction of commodity\nprices. Oil prices bottomed at $43.46 in early 2015, having traded above $100 a\nbarrel only 8 months earlier and started to turn higher in March. As a major oil\nproducer, Canada would stand to beneﬁt from stabilization in crude prices. At the\ntime U.S. policy makers were talking about raising interest rates, the Australian\ndollar was beneﬁtting from improving domestic conditions, and sterling soared on\npositive data and a victory by the incumbent during the 2015 general election.\nSelling any of these currencies and buying the Canadian dollar would have been a\nrisky endeavor. Instead the best bet at th e time was to sell the New Zealand dollar\nand buy the Canadian dollar or the NZDCAD pair because New Zealand reported\nextremely weak labor data that prompted policy makers to talk about easing. As\nyou can see in Figure 17.2, NZDCAD started to turn lower just as oil prices moved\nhigher in March.\nFIGURE 17.3 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK152The best way to gauge strong versus weak is to monitor economic data surprises.\nWhile the ECB was buying bonds and implementing quantitative easing, Eurozone\ndata started to improve and U.S. data started to weaken. The market had not\nanticipated this shift in dynamic as they had been looking for weak Eurozone data to\nreinforce QE and stronger U.S. data to push the Fed to tighten. This unexpected\nchange drove EURUSD sharply higher, and buying breakouts in April and May as\nshown in Figure 17.3 would have been good bets.\n153CHAPTER 18\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nThe Leveraged\nCarry Trade\nThe leverage carry trade strategy is the quintessential global macro trade that\nhas long been one of the favorite strategies of hedge funds and investment\nbanks. On its most fundamental level, the carry trade strategy involves buying\na high-yielding currency and funding it with the sale of a low-yielding currency.\nAggressive speculators will leave the trade unhedged with the hope that the high\nyielding currency will appreciate in value relative to the lower yielding currency,\nallowing them to earn the interest rate differential on top of the capital appreciation.\nMore conservative investors may choose to hedge the exchange rate component,\nearning only the interest rate differential. Although the differentials tend to be small,\nusually 1 to 3 percent if the position is leveraged 5 to 10 times, the proﬁts from\ninterest rates alone can be substantial. Of course it is important to remember that\nwhile leverage can magnify proﬁts, it can also exacerbate losses. Capital appreciation\ngenerally occurs when a number of traders identify proﬁt opportunities and pile into\nthe same trade, driving up the value of the currency pair.\nIn foreign exchange trading, the carry trade is a popular way to take advantage\nof the notion that money ﬂows in and out of different markets, driven by the law\nof supply and demand: with markets offering higher rates of return on investment\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE154attracting the most capital. Countries are no different—in the world of international\ncapital ﬂows, nations that offer the highest interest rates will generally attract more\ninvestment creating greater demand for their currencies. This helps to fuel the\ncarry trade. The carry trade strategy is simple to master, but like all strategies,\nit contains risk. Carry trades perf ormed extremely well between 2000 and 2007,\nfailed miserably between 2008 and 2009, and recovered between late 2012 into\n2015. The chance of loss can be great if you do not understand how, why, and when\ncarry trades work best.\n■How Do Carry Trades Work?\nTo understand carry trading, it is important to ﬁrst understand that currencies are\nalways traded in pairs, so taking a carry trade involves buying a currency that offers\na high interest rate and simultaneously selling a currency that offers a low interest\nrate. Carry trades are proﬁtable when the exchange rate remains unchanged in\nvalue and investors are able to earn the d ifference in interes t—or spread—between\nthe two currencies, or when it appreciates in value, allowing the investor to earn\nthe spread along with capital appreciation. If the exchange rate falls by more than\nthe spread on the interest rate, it becomes a net loss for the investor.\nLet’s take a look at an example: Assume that the Australian dollar offers an\ninterest rate of 4.75%, while the Swiss franc offers an interest rate of 0.25%. To\nexecute the carry trade, an investor buys the Australian dollar and sells the Swiss\nfranc. In doing so, he or she can earn a proﬁt of 4.50% (2.75% in interest earned\nminus 0.25% in interest paid), as long as the exchange rate between Australian\ndollars and Swiss francs do not change. Figure 18.1 shows exactly how an investor\nwould execute the carry trade.\nLong Short\nBuy AUD\n4.75%Sell CHF\n0.25%Investor\nReceives: 4.75% from long AUD\nposition\nPays: 0.25% through short USD\nfunding position\nProfit: 4.50% in interest rate\nspread, assuming spot rate is \nconstantEnters long AUD/USD trade:\nFIGURE 18.1 Leveraged Carry Trade Example\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE155To summarize : A carry trade involves buying a currency that offers a high interest\nrate while selling a currency that offers a low interest rate.\n■Why Do Carry Trades Work?\nInterest rates are very important: Carry trades work because of the constant\nmovement of capital into and out of different countries in search of the highest yield.\nInterest rates are the main reason why some countries attract more investment\nthan others. There are three reasons why a country can pay a higher interest rate.\nFirst, if a country’s economy is doing well (high growth, high productivity, low\nunemployment, rising incomes, etc.), it will be able to offer those who invest in the\ncountry a higher rate of return. Second, central banks can raise interest rates on fast\ngrowing economies with rising inﬂation. Third, countries with high debt to GDP\nratios, low credit ratings, and/or inherent growth problems may also need to pay a\nhigher interest rate to attract investment.\nInvestors prefer to earn higher interest rates: Investors who are interested in\nmaximizing their proﬁts will naturally look for investments that offer them the\nhighest rate of return. When making a decision to invest in a particular currency, an\ninvestor is more likely to choose one that offers the highest rate of return, or in this\ncase, interest rate. If several investors make this exact same decision, the country\nwill experience an inﬂow of capital from those seeking to earn a high rate of return,\nand the currency should appreciate.\nWhat about countries that are not doing well economically? Countries that have\nlow growth and low productivity will not be able to offer investors a high rate of\nreturn unless they have a very poor credit rating and are forced to offer a higher\nrate to compensate for the risk of holding the country’s bond or currency. With\nmajor economies, however, there will be times where growth is so weak that\ninterest rates are brought to zero, providing investors with no meaningful return.\nThe difference between countries that offer h igh interest rates versus countries that\noffer low interest rates is what makes carry trades possible.\nLet’s take another look at the carry trade example above in more detail.\nImagine an investor in Switzerland who is earning an interest rate of 0.25% per\nyear on her bank deposit in Swiss francs. At the time, a bank in Australia is offering\n4.75% per year on a deposit of Australian dollars. Seeing that interest rates are much\nhigher with the Australian bank, this in vestor would like to ﬁnd a way to earn this\nhigher rate of interest on her money.\nNow imagine that the investor could somehow trade her deposit of Swiss francs\nby paying 0.25% for a deposit of Australian dollars paying 4.75%. What she has\neffectively done is to ‘‘sell’’ her Swiss franc deposit and use those funds to ‘‘buy’’ an\nAustralian dollar deposit. With this transaction, she now owns an Australian dollar\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE156Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.2 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 1\ndeposit that pays her 4.75% in interest per year, 4.50% more than she was earning\nwith her Swiss franc deposit.\nThis investor has essentially just done a carry trade by ‘‘buying’’ an Australian\ndollar deposit, and ‘‘selling’’ a Swiss franc deposit.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows out of\nSwitzerland and into Australia, as investors take their Swiss francs and convert them\ninto Australian dollars. Australia attracts more capital because of the higher rates it\noffers. This inﬂow of capital increases the value of the currency (see Figure 18.2).\nTo summarize : Carry trades are made possible by the differences in interest rates\nbetween countries. B ecause they prefer to ea rn higher interest ra tes, investors will\nlook to buy and hold high interest rate paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Work Best?\nThere will be times when carry trades work better than others. In fact, carry trades\nare the most proﬁtable when there is a very speciﬁc attitude toward risk.\n■How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take?\nThe moods of people in general change over time—sometimes they may feel more\ndaring and willing to take chances; other times they may be more timid and prone to\nconservativeness. Investors, as a group, are no different. Sometimes they are willing\nto make investments that involve a good amount of risk; other times they are more\nfearful of losses and look to invest in safer assets.\nIn ﬁnancial jargon, when investors as a whole are willing to take on risk, we\ncall this low risk aversion, which means they are in risk-seeking mode. Alternatively,\nwhen investors are drawn to more conservative investments and less willing to take\no nr i s k ,w ed e s c r i b et h e ma s risk-averse .\nCarry trades are the most proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion .T h i s\nnotion makes sense when you consider what a carry trade involves. Remember, a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE157carry trade involves buying a currency that pays a high interest rate while selling a\ncurrency that pays a low interest rate. In buying the high interest rate currency, the\ninvestor is taking a risk because it is believed that a country needs to offer a higher\ninterest rate to offset the risk of holding th e currency. Also, while high interest rates\nattract investment, they can also hurt growth by raising the cost of borrowing. This\ncreates uncertainty around whether the economy of the country will continue to\nperform well and be able to pay not just high but even higher interest rates. This\nrisk is something a carry trade investor must be willing to take.\nIf investors as a whole were not willing to take on this risk, then capital would\nnever move from one country to another, and the carry trade opportunity would\nnot exist. Therefore, in order to return, carry trades require that investors as a\ngroup have low risk aversion, or be willing to bear the risk of investing in the higher\ninterest rate currency.\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the most proﬁtable when investors are willing\nto bear the risk of investing in high interest paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Not Work?\nSo far, we have shown that a carry trade will work best when investors have low\nrisk aversion. What happens when investors have high risk aversion ?\nCarry trades are the least proﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion .W h e n\ninvestors have high risk aversion, they are less willing as a group to take chances\nwith their investments. This means they would be less willing to invest in riskier\ncurrencies that offer higher interest rates. Instead, when investors have high risk\naversion they would actually prefer to put their money in ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies\nthat pay lower interest rates. During this time, they may also opt to close or unwind\ntheir carry trades. In doing so, they would be buying the currency with the low\ninterest rate and selling the curre ncy with the high interest rate.\nReturning to our earlier example, let’s assume the investor suddenly feels\nuncomfortable holding the foreign currency, the Australian dollar. Now, instead of\nlooking for the higher interest rate, she is more interested in keeping her investment\nsafe. As a result, she swaps her Australian dollars for more familiar Swiss francs.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows\nout of Australia and into Switzerland as investors take their Australian dollars and\nconvert them into Swiss francs. During this period of risk aversion, Switzerland\nattracts more capital due to the perceived safety of its currency, and the inﬂow of\ncapital increases the value of the Swiss franc (see Figure18.3).\nWhen investors have high risk aversion, they prefer to avoid the riskier high\ninterest rate paying currency and instea d invest in the safer, lower interest rate\npaying currency, which is the opposite of a carry trade.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE158Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.3 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 2\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the least proﬁtable in periods of uncertainty\nwhen investors are unwilling to bear the risk of investing in high interest paying\ncurrencies.\n■The Importance of Risk Aversion\nCarry trades will generally be proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion, and\nunproﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion. So before placing a carry trade\nit is important to understand the risk environment—whether investors as a whole\nhave high or low risk aversion—and when it changes .\nRising risk aversion is generally beneﬁcial for low interest rate paying currencies:\nSometimes the mood of investors will change rapidly, and investors’ willingness\nto make risky trades can change dramatically from one moment to the next.\nOften, these large shifts are caused by signiﬁcant global events. When periods\nof risk aversion occur quickly, the result is generally a large capital inﬂow into\nlow-interest-rate-paying ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies (see Figure 18.2).\nFor example, in the summer of 1998 the Japanese yen appreciated against the\ndollar by more than 20% over the span of two months, due to the Russian debt\ncrisis and LTCM hedge fund bailout. Similarly, just after the September 11 terrorist\nattacks the Swiss franc rose by more than 7% against the dollar over a 10-day period.\nDuring the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, we also saw big gains in the yen and the\nSwiss franc.\nThese sharp movements in currency values often occur when risk aversion quickly\nchanges from low to high. As a result, when risk aversion shifts, a carry trade can\nturn from being proﬁtable to unproﬁtable very quickly.\nRisk Aversion and Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nAs investor risk aversion goes from high to low, carry trades become more proﬁtable\nas detailed in Figure 18.4.\nHow do you know if investors as a whole have high or low risk aversion?\nUnfortunately, it is difﬁcult to measure investor risk aversion with a single number.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE1591 .

Low-interest currencies\ntend to remain weak, used in \nfinancing risky trades(–)( +)\nFIGURE 18.4 Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nOne way to get a broad idea of risk aversion levels is to look at bond yields. The\nwider the spread between the yields of bonds from different countries with similar\ncredit ratings, the higher the investor risk aversion. Bond yields are readily available\non major ﬁnancial websites such as Bloomberg.com and Reuters.com. In addition,\nseveral large banks have developed their own measures of risk aversion that signal\nwhen investors are willing to take risk and when they are not.\nOther Things to Bear in Mind When Considering a Carry Trade\nWhile risk aversion is one of the most important things to consider before making\na carry trade, it is not the only one. The following are some additional issues to be\naware of.\nLow Interest Rate Currency Appreciation\nBy entering into a carry trade, an investor is able to earn a proﬁt from the interest\nrate difference, or spread, between a high interest rate currency and a low interest\nrate currency. However, the carry trade can turn unproﬁtable if for some reason\n(like the risk aversion examples earlier), the low interest rate currency appreciates\nby a signiﬁcant amount.\nAside from rising risk aversion, improving economic conditions within a low\ninterest paying country can also cause its currency to appreciate. An ideal carry trade\nwill involve a low interest currency whose economy is weak and has low expectations\nfor growth. If the economy were to improve, however, the country might then be\nable to offer investors a higher rate of return through increased interest rates. If this\nwere to occur—again, using the previous example, say that Switzerland increased\nthe interest rates it offered—then investors may take advantage of these higher rates\nby investing in Swiss francs. As seen in Figure 18.3, an appreciation of the Swiss franc\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE160would negatively affect the proﬁtability of the Australian dollar–Swiss franc carry\ntrade. (At the very least, higher interest rates in Switzerland would negatively affect\nthe carry trade’s proﬁtability by lowering the interest rate spread.)\nThis same sequence of events may currently be unfolding for the Japanese yen.\nGiven its zero interest rates, the Jap anese yen has for a very long time been an\nideal low interest rate currency to use in carry trades (known as yen carry trades ).\nThis situation however, may be changing. Increased optimism about the Japanese\neconomy has recently led to an increase in the Japanese stock market. Increased\ninvestor demand for Japanese stocks and currency has caused the yen to appreciate,\nand this yen appreciation negatively affects the proﬁtability of carry trades like\nAustralian dollar (high interest rate) versus Japanese yen.\nIf investors continue to buy the yen, the yen carry trade could start to become\nunproﬁtable. This further illustrates the fact that when the low interest rate currency\nin a carry trade (the currency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the\nproﬁtability of the overall carry trade position.\nTrade Balances\nA country’s trade balance (the differen ce between imports and exports) can also\naffect the proﬁtability of a carry trade. We know that when investors have low\nrisk aversion or are risk seeking, capital will ﬂow from the low interest rate paying\ncurrency to the high interest rate paying currency (see Figure 18.2) but this does\nnot always happen.\nOne reason is because countries with large trade surplus can still see their\ncurrencies appreciate in low risk environments because running a trade surplus\nmeans that the country exports more than it imports. This creates naturally demand\nfor the currency.\nThe point of this example is to show that even when investors have low risk\naversion, large trade imbalances can cause a low interest rate currency to appreciate\n(as in Figure 18.3). And when the low interest rate currency in a carry trade (the\ncurrency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the proﬁtability of the carry\ntrade.\nTime Horizon\nIn general, a carry trade is a long-term strategy. Before entering into a carry trade,\nan investor should be willing to commit to a time-horizon of at least six months. This\ncommitment helps to make sure that the trade will not be affected by the ‘‘noise’’\nof shorter-term currency price movements.\nTo summarize : Carry trade investors should be aware of factors such as currency\nappreciation, trade balances, and time horizon before placing a trade. Any or all of\nthese factors can cause a seemingly proﬁtable carry trade to become unproﬁtable.\n161CHAPTER 19\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nMacro Event Driven\nTrade\nShort-term traders are generally focused only on the economic release of the\nweek and how it will impact their day trading activities. This works well for\nmany traders, but it is also important not to lose sight of the big macro events\nthat may be brewing in the economy or the world for that matter. Large-scale\nmacroeconomic events will move markets and will move them in very big ways.\nTheir impact goes beyond a simple one- or two-day price change because depending\non their size and scope, these occurrences have the potential to reshape the\nfundamental perception toward a currency for months or even years at a time.\nEvents such as wars, political uncertainly, natural disasters, and major international\nmeetings or monetary policy changes are so potent due to their irregularity that they\ncan have widespread psychological and physical impacts on the currency market.\nWith these events come both currencies that appreciate vastly and currencies that\ndepreciate just as dramatically. Therefore, keeping on top of global developments,\nunderstanding the underlying direction of market sentiment before and after these\nevents occur and anticipating them could be very proﬁtable, or at least can help\nprevent signiﬁcant losses.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE162■Know When Big Events Occur: Here Is a List\nof a Few Important Ones\n■Signiﬁcant G7 ﬁnance ministers meetings\n■Presidential elections\n■Important summits\n■Major Central Bank meetings\n■Potential changes to currency regimes\n■Possible debt defaults by large countries\n■Possible wars as a result of rising geopolitical tensions\n■Federal Reserve chairman’s semiannual testimony on economy\nThe best way to highlight the signiﬁcance of these events is look at a few notable\nmacroeconomic examples from the past two decades.\n2014 Ukraine–Russia Crisis\nThe 2014 Ukraine–Russia crisis was one of the biggest geopolitical events of the\npast decade. The crisis began in 2013 but didn’t really hit its peak until March\n2014 when Russia signed a bill to absorb Crimea. Leading up to the announcement,\nthe uncertainty put signiﬁcant pressure on the EURUSD in January 2014 with the\ncurrency pair dropping sharply on March 18, 2014, the day that Russia declared that\nCrimea was now ofﬁcially apart of their country. This led to a few more weeks of\ndownward pressure for the EURUSD as shown in Figure 19.1 as investors awaited\nthe world’s response. Many nations declared their support for Ukraine and war was\nfeared, but eventually Russia was only hit with sanctions, and a few months later,\nthe Ukraine crisis moved to the back burner.\nEuropean Sovereign Debt Crisis (2009–2013)\nThe European Sovereign Debt Crisis started in 2009 and lasted into 2013 with the bulk\nof the damage being done by February 2012. It was a multiyear debt crisis that was\nsparked by the inability of many member nations to meet their debt obligations after\nthe global ﬁnancial crisis. Their banking sectors and economies suffered signiﬁcant\nlosses, and persistently negative growth prospects made it impossible for countries\nsuch as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus to repay or reﬁnance their government\ndebt. Between 2010 and 2012, all of these na tions required bailouts or some form\nof support from the Troika, composed of the ECB, IMF and European Commission.\nWhile the problems were concentrated in smaller Eurozone nations, there was fear\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE163\nFIGURE 19.1 EURUSD Ukraine Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE164\nFIGURE 19.2 EURUSD Sovereign Debt Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nof contagion for the major economies. The country of Spain did not require a bailout\nbut in 2012, a number of banks required additional funding. The crisis posed caused\nsigniﬁcant volatility for the euro. Figure 19.2 shows two long periods of EURUSD\nweakness that were caused by bailouts, downgrades, and other negative headlines.\nGlobal Financial Crisis (2007–2009), Subprime\nOne of the most important macroeconomic events of the twenty-ﬁrst century was\nthe 2007 to 2009 subprime/global ﬁnancial crisis. It was triggered by a sharp slide\nin house prices, default on mortgages, and blowup of subprime mortgage backed\nsecurities and collateralized debt obligations. This, in turn, caused massive losses for\nbanks and ﬁnancial institutions, leading the failure of major ﬁrms such as Lehman\nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns. The impact on the ﬁnancial market and\nthe economy was staggering, with many countries falling into recession. During this\nperiod, the stock market lost more than 50% of its value with the S&P 500, falling\nfrom a high of 1,565 in October 2007 to a low of 676 in March 2009. As shown in\nFigure 19.3, USDJPY dropped from a high of 116.47 in October 2007 to a low of\n87.13 in January 2009. This was only the beginning of a multiyear decline for the\ncurrency pair. EURUSD had a delayed reaction, rallying strongly between October\n2007 and April 2008 as money ﬂowed out of the U.S. economy, and then falling\nsharply between July 2008 and October 2008 as the risk aversion and crisis spread\nto Europe.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE165\nFIGURE 19.3 USDJPY Global Financial Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nPolitical Uncertainty: 2004 U.S. Presidential Election\nAnother example of major events impacting the currency market is the 2004 U.S.\npresidential elections. In general, political instability causes perceived weakness\nin currencies. The hotly contested presidential election in November of 2004,\ncombined with the differences in the candidates’ stance on the growing budget\ndeﬁcit, resulted in overall dollar bearishness. The sentiment was exacerbated even\nfurther, given the lack of international support for the incumbent President (Bush)\ndue to the administration’s decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein. As a result, in\nthe three weeks leading up to the election, the euro rose 600 pips against the U.S.\ndollar. This can be seen in Figure 19.4. With a Bush victory becoming increasingly\nclear and later conﬁrmed, the dollar sold off against the majors as the market looked\nahead to what would probably end up being the maintenance of status quo. On the\nday following the election, the EURUSD rose another 200 pips and then continued\nto rise an additional 700 pips before peaking out six weeks later. This entire move\ntook place over the course of two months, which may seem like an eternity for\nmany, but this macroeconomic event really shaped the markets and for those who\nwere following it, big proﬁts could have been made. However, this is important\neven for short-term traders because given that the market was bearish dollars in\ngeneral leading up to the U.S. presidential election, a more prudent trade would be\nto look for opportunities to buy the EURUSD on dips rather than trying sell rallies\nand look for tops.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE166\nPost Election -\nAnother 700\nPip Rally \n600 Pip Rally\nPre Election\n2004 Election\nNight\nFIGURE 19.4 EURUSD Election Trade\nSource: eSignal\nG7 Meeting Dubai September 2003\nThe G7 ﬁnance ministers meeting on September 22, 2003, was a very important\nturning point for the markets. The dollar collapsed signiﬁcantly following the meeting\nat which the G7 ﬁnance ministers wanted to see ‘‘more ﬂexibility in exchange rates.’’\nDespite the rather tame nature of these words, the market interpreted this line to be\na major shift in policy. The last time changes to this degree had been made was back in\n2000. Taking a step back, the countries that constitute the G7 are the United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, and France. Collectively, these\ncountries account for two-thirds of the world’s total economic output. Not all G7\nmeetings are important. The only time the market really hones in on the G7 ﬁnance\nministers meeting is when they expect big changes to be made to the statement. In\n2000, the market paid particular attention to the upcoming meeting because there\nwas strong intervention in the EURUSD the day before the meeting. The meeting\nin September 2003 was also important because the U.S. trade deﬁcit was ballooning\nand becoming a huge issue. The EURUSD bore the brunt of the dollar depreciation\nwhile Japan and China were intervening aggressively in their currencies. As a result,\nit was widely expected that the G7 ﬁnance ministers as a whole would issue a\nstatement that was highly critical of Japan and China’s intervention policies. Leading\nup to the meeting, the U.S. dollar had alre ady begun to sell off as indicated by the\nchart. At the time of the announcement, the EURUSD shot up 150 pips. Though\nthis initial move was not ve ry substantial, between Se ptember 2003 and February\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE167\n6% Rally\n14% Rally\nSept 22, 2003\nG7 Meeting\nFIGURE 19.5 EURUSD G7 Meeting\nSource: eSignal\n2004 (which was the next G7 meeting), the dollar fell 8% on a trade-weighted\nbasis, 9% against the British pound, 11% against the euro, 7% against the yen,\nand 1.5% against the Canadian dollar. To put the percentages into perspective, a\nmove of 11% is equivalent to approximately 1100 pips. Therefore, the longer-term\nimpact is much more signiﬁcant than the immediate impact as the event itself has the\nsigniﬁcance to change the overall sentiment in the market. Figure 19.5 is a weekly\nchart of the EURUSD that illustrates how the currency pair performed following\nthe September 22, 2003 G7 meeting.\nU.S. War Against Iraq\nGeopolitical risks such as wars can also have a pronounced impact on the currency\nmarket. Figure 19.6 shows that bet ween December 2002 and February 2003, the\ndollar depreciated 9% against the Swiss franc (USDCHF) in the months leading up\nto war. The dollar sold off because the war itself was incredibly unpopular among\nthe international community. The Swiss franc was one of the primary beneﬁciaries\ndue to the country’s political neutrality an d safe-haven status. Between February\nand March, traders began to believe that the inevitable war would turn into a quick\nand decisive U.S. victory, so they began to unwind the war trade. This eventually\nled to a 3% rally in USDCHF as investors exited their short dollar positions.\nEach of these events caused large-scale movements in the currency market. Such\nevents are clearly important to follow for all types of traders. Keeping abreast of\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE168\nFIGURE 19.6 USDCHF Iraq War\nSource: eSignal\nbroad macroeconomic events can help traders make smarter decisions and prevent\nthem from fading large factors that may be brewing in the background. Most of\nthese events are talked about, debated, and anticipated many months in advance by\neconomists, currency analysts, and the international community in general.\n169CHAPTER 20\nQuantitative Easing\nand Its Impact on\nForex\nQuantitative easing is such an important topic that it deserves its own chapter.\nAfter the global ﬁnancial crisis many countries fell into recession, and in\nresponse central banks around the world lowered interest rates to record lows.\nWhen rates could not fall any lower, they had to resort to unprecedented measures,\nthe most powerful of which was quantit ative easing (QE). Between 2007 and 2015,\nthe Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and\nthe Swedish National Bank all resorted to QE, and their decision had a signiﬁcant\nimpact on their currencies on both a short- and long-term basis.\nThe goal of quantitative easing is to keep yields low and to ﬂood the market\nwith liquidity. To do so, a central bank would create money by buying ﬁnancial\nassets such as government bonds from banks using electronic cash. This basically\n‘‘creates new money.’’ It also keeps yields low because bond prices have an inverse\nrelationship with yields and in giving banks money, the hope is that it will encourage\nlending and in turn lead to more economic activity. The jury is out on how\nmuch QE really helped these economies, but the inﬂuence on currencies was\nundeniable.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX170■U.S. Quantitative Easing\nAfter the ﬁnancial crisis, the ﬁrst major central bank to respond with quantitative\neasing was the U.S. Federal Reserve. In November 2008, the central bank launched\na $600 billion bond-buying program. The program was initially effective as the\neconomy improved, prompting the Fed to temporarily halt bond purchases.\nHowever, the economy never gained additional momentum and as such, the central\nbank returned with a second round of QE (dubbed QE2) in November 2010. The\nsize of the program matched the ﬁrst round. Unfortunately, more bond buys were\nneeded, and QE3 was launched in September 2012. Unlike QE1 and QE2, QE3\nwas an open-ended program. The central bank announced plans to purchase $40\nbillion in assets every month, and in December 2012, that amount was increased\nto $85 billion per month. The program lasted for ﬁve years, and purchases were\nﬁnally halted in October 2014. Figure 20.1 shows how each round of quantitative\neasing impacted the EURUSD. As you can see, each round triggered a sharp rise in\nEURUSD and—another way to look at it—weakness in the U.S. dollar. In 2008,\nthe month that QE1 was announced, EURUSD surged 17% from high to low.\nWhen QE2 was announced, the EURUSD began a rally that took the pair up more\nthan 20%. QE3 led to a similar uptrend with gains extended when the program\nwas increased.\n■UK Quantitative Easing\nQuantitative easing was launched by the Bank of England in March 2009. At the\ntime, the BoE pledged to spend 75 billion pounds over a three-month period buying\nUK assets, but the program continue d and between March 2009 and January 2010,\nthe central bank had spent 200 billion pounds. In October 2011, growth started to\nslow more dramatically with the economy facing a double dip recession. In response\npolicymakers voted to increase the QE program by another 75 billion. In February\n2012, the central bank added another 50 billion and the same increase was made in\nJuly 2012, bringing the total program to 375 billion pounds. Figure 20.2 shows how\nGBPUSD responded to each round of QE. What is interesting is that the sterling\nfell sharply in the run up to the March 2009 announcement. It extended lower\nafterward but rebounded in the months that followed. In 2011, 2012, and 2013,\nthe sterling rallied the month that QE was announced. One important thing to\nremember is that the Federal Reserve was also buying bonds and expanding its own\nQE program at the time, so the two offset each other to some degree, limiting the\nreaction in GBPUSD. More importantly, investors interpreted each round of BoE\nQE as positive for the currency because they hoped that the central bank’s efforts\nwould help to turn around the economy.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk171\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.1 EURUSD US Fed QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk172\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.2 GBPUSD UK BoE QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk173\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.3 USDJPY Japan BoJ QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk174\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.4 EURUSD EZ ECB QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX175■Japan Quantitative Easing\nThe phrase quantitative easing was ﬁrst used by the Bank of Japan in 2001. At the time,\nthey did not believe that the program was effective but after the ﬁnancial crisis, they\nsaid they would examine their asset purchase program. In October 2011 the Bank of\nJapan increased the program by 5 trillion yen which was a small sum (approximately\nUSD$66 billion) compared to the staggering amounts that other countries were\npurchasing. Then in April 2013, they announced a bold and aggressive plan to\nbuy 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen a year as part of Prime Minister Abe’s economic\npolicies. This program was later expanded to 80 billion yen a year. Unlike other\ncountries where the effectiveness of QE was debated, Japan’s bond buying program\nplayed a large role in turning around the economy. It also had a signiﬁcant impact\non the currency. In Figure 20.3 we show how the ﬁrst program yielded a very small\nresponse in USDJPY but when the Bank of Japan came out in size, USDJPY reacted\nquickly and aggressively with a move that extended even further when the program\nwas expanded.\n■Eurozone Quantitative Easing\nThe European Central Bank was the last major central bank to roll out quantitative\neasing. They were reluctant to do so for a very long time because structurally the\nEurozone is not set up for quantitative easing. Since there is no euro-bond, some\ncritics felt that it was not in line with the central bank’s mandate. However faced\nwith sluggish growth, stubbornly low inﬂation, and an interest rate already at zero,\nthe ECB had very few options. They publicly discussed the option months before the\nactual decision, giving the market plenty of opportunity to discount the move. In\nJanuary 2015, the ECB announced that they would spend 60 billion euros per month\nbuying private and public bonds. In March 2015, ECB President Draghi unveiled\nan aggressive 1 trillion quantitative easing program. As shown in Figure 20.4, both\nannouncements had a signiﬁcant impact on the currency, but EURUSD stabilized\nafter the second announcement (but only after falling 500 pips) because investors\nhoped that the aggressive program by the central bank would help turn around\nthe economy.\nWhile no additional quantitative easing programs are expected as of mid-2015,\nthe unwinding of these unprecedented measures in the coming years should have\njust as much impact on currencies as the initial announcement itself, providing an\nopportunity for forex traders."

        "135CHAPTER 14\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: 20-Day\nBreakout Trade\nTrading breakouts can be both a rewarding and frustrating endeavor as breakouts\nhave a tendency to fail. A major reason why this can occur frequently in the\nforeign exchange market is because it is more technically driven than others and as a\nresult, there are many market participants who intentionally look to break pairs out\nin order to ‘‘suck’’ in other nonsuspecting traders. In an effort to ﬁlter out potential\nfalse breakouts, a price action screener should be used to identify breakouts that\nhave a higher probability of success. The rules behind this strategy are speciﬁcally\ndeveloped to take advantage of strong trending markets that make new highs that\nthen proceed to ‘‘fail’’ by taking out a recent low and then reverse again to make\nanother new high. This type of setup tends to have a very high success rate as it\nallows traders to enter strong trending markets after weaker players have been\nﬂushed out, only to have real money players reenter the market and push the pair\nup to new highs.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day high.\n2. Look for the pair to reverse the same day or next to make a two-day low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE1363. Buy the pair if it takes out the 20-day high within three days of making the\ntwo-day low.\n4. Place the initial stop a few pips below the two-day low.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nShorts:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day low.\n2. That day or the next the pair rallies to make a two-day high.\n3. Sell the pair if it trades below the 20-day low within three days of making the\ntwo-day high.\n4. Risk up to a few ticks above the two-day high.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nExamples\nNow take a look at our ﬁrst example in Figure 14.1. The daily chart of GBPUSD\nshows the currency pair making a new 20-day high on February 5. At this point,\nthe currency pair is on our radar, and we watch for a new two-day low to be made\nFIGURE 14.1 GBPUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE137within the next three days. This occurs right on schedule after which we wait for\nthe currency pair to make a new 20-day high, which occurs on February 12. At the\ntime, we buy GBPUSD a few pips above the previous 20-day high of 1.5352. We\nenter at 1.5360. The stop is placed a few pips below the original two-day low of\n1.5197 (or 1.5190). As the currency pair moves in our favor, we look to exit half\nof the position when it moves by the amount that we risked, which is 155 pips or\n1.5507. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or the\ninitial entry price of 1.5352. This rest of the trade is exited 24 hours later.\nFigure 14.2 provides an example of how the strategy can work in the EURUSD\nto the short side. On December 23, the currency pair makes a new 20-day low of\n1.2165. It goes on radar and we start looking for the currency pair to rebound within\nthe next three days. The recovery occurs the following day, and a new two-day\nhigh is made. Then we look for the previous 20-day low to be broken within the\nfollowing three days and that occurs shortly thereafter. At which point we enter\na short EURUSD trade at 1.2155 with a stop at 1.2260, or a few pips above the\ntwo-day high of 1.2254. Our risk on the trade is 105 pips. When the currency pair\ndrops to 1.2050, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. Then we trail the stop using a 2-bar high and end up exiting the\nremainder of the position at 1.1846.\nThe ﬁnal example shown in Figure 14.3 is in AUDUSD. The currency starts by\nmaking a new 20-day low on January 26. It goes on radar and we start looking\nfor the currency pair to rebound within the next three days. The recovery occurs\nFIGURE 14.2 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE138\nFIGURE 14.3 AUDUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nintraday, and a new two-day high is made right on schedule. Then we look for the\nprevious 20-day low to be broken within the following three days it occurs 24 hours\nafter the two-day high is made. At which point we enter a short AUDUSD trade a\nfew pips below the 20-day low at 0.7850 with a stop at 0.8032, or a few pips above\nthe two-day high of 0.8025. Our risk on the trade is 182 pips. When the currency\npair drops to 0.7668, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. The breakeven stop is triggered the very same day that the ﬁrst\ntarget is reached.\n139CHAPTER 15\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Channels\nChannel trading is a less exotic but popular trading technique for currencies. The\nreason why it can work is because currencies rarely spend much time in tight\ntrading ranges and have the tendency to develop strong trends. By reviewing a few\ncharts, traders can see that channels can easily be identiﬁed and occur frequently.\nA common scenario would be channel trading during the Asian session and a\nbreakout in either the London or U.S. session. There are many instances where\neconomic releases are one of the most common triggers for a break of the channel.\nTherefore, it is imperative that traders keep on top of economic releases. If a channel\nhas formed and a big U.S. number (per say) is expected to be released, and the\ncurrency pair is at the top of a channel, the probability of a break is high, so traders\nshould be looking to buy the break out, not fade it.\nChannels are created when we draw a trendline, and then draw a line that is\nparallel to that trendline. Most if not all of the price activity of the currency pair\nshould fall between the two channel lines. We will seek to identify situations where\nthe price is trading within a narrow channel, and then trade in the direction of a\nbreakout from the channel. This strategy can be particularly effective when used\nprior to a fundamental market event such as the release of major economic news, or\nprior to the ‘‘open’’ of a major ﬁnancial market.\nHere are some rules for using this technique to ﬁnd long trades:\n1. First, identify a channel on either an intraday or daily chart. The price should\nbe contained within a narrow range.\n2. Enter long as the price breaks above the upper channel line by 10 pips.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS1403. Place a stop at the lower channel line.\n4. Exit the position when it moves by double the amount risked.\nThe short rules are the reverse.\n■Examples\nLet examine a few examples. The ﬁrst example is a USDCAD 15-minute chart\nshown in Figure 15.1. The total range of the channel is approximately 30 pips with\nthe low being 1.2028 and the high 1.2056. In accordance with our strategy, we\nplace entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at 1.2018 and 1.2066. The\norder to buy gets triggered ﬁrst, and almost immediately we place a stop order\nat the low of the channel or 1.2028, which means we are risking 38 pips on the\ntrade. USDCAD then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of double the range at\n1.2142. More conservative traders could exit half of the position when it moves by\nthe amount risked, or 38 pips, and trail the stop on the remainder of the position.\nThe next example shown in Figure 15.2 is a 15-minute chart of EURGBP. The\ntotal range between the two lines is 12 p ips with the low being 0.7148 and the high\n0.7160. In accordance with our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and\nbelow the channel at 0.7138 and 0.7170. The order to buy gets triggered ﬁrst and\nalmost immediately we place a stop at the low of the channel or 0.7160 for 10-pip\nrisk. EURGBP then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of 20 pips or double\nthe amount risked.\nFIGURE 15.1 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS141\nFIGURE 15.2 EURGBP 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 15.3 EURUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFigure 15.3 is a 15-minute chart of the EURUSD. The total range during this\nfour-hour period is 18 pips with a high of 1.1206 and a low of 1.1188. In accordance\nwith our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at\n1.1216 and 1.1178. The order to sell gets triggered ﬁrst and almost immediately,\nwe place a stop order at the channel high of 1.1206 for a risk of 28 pips. The\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS142EURUSD then proceeds to sell off signiﬁcantly but only makes it to a low of 1.1132\nbefore stopping us out a few days later. We chose to show this example because it\nexplains why the more conservative approach of exiting half of the position when it\nmoves by the amount risk is more desirable, even though it has worse risk reward.\nA move of 58 pips is sizable on an intraday basis and may be difﬁcult to achieve.\nWhenever the risk is greater than 20 pips, it may be more prudent to exit half and\ntrail the stop.\n143CHAPTER 16\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Perfect\nOrder\nAperfect order in moving averages is deﬁned as a set of moving averages that\nis in sequential order. For an uptrend, a perfect order would be a situation\nin which the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) is at a higher price level than\nthe 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 50-day SMA. Meanwhile, the 100-day\nSMA would be below the 50-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA would be below\nthe 100-day SMA. In a downtrend, the opposite is true, where the 200-day SMA is\nat the highest level and the 10-day SMA is at the lowest level. Having the moving\naverages stacked up in sequential order are generally a strong indicator of a trending\nenvironment. Not only does it indicate that the momentum is on the side of trend,\nbut the moving averages also serve as multiple levels of support. To optimize the\nperfect order strategy, traders should also look for ADX to be greater than 20 and\ntrending upward. This represents a strong trend. Entry and exit levels are difﬁcult\nto determine with this strategy, but genera l l ys p e a k i n g ,w ew a n tt os t a yi nt h et r a d e\nfor as long as the perfect order remains in place and exit once the perfect order no\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER144longer holds. Perfect orders do not happen often, and the premise of this strategy is\nto capture the perfect order when it ﬁrst happens.\nThe perfect order seeks to take advantage of a trending environment near the\nbeginning of the trend:\n1. Look for a currency pair with moving averages in perfect order.\n2. Look for ADX pointing upwards, ideally greater than 20.\n3. Buy ﬁve candles after the initial formation of the perfect order (if it still\nholds).\n4. Initial stop is the low on the day of the initial crossover for longs and the high\nfor shorts.\n5. Exit the position when the perfect order no longer holds.\n■Examples\nFigure 16.1 is a daily chart of the EURUSD. In August 2014, the moving averages\nin the EURUSD formed a sequential perfect order. We check and see that ADX is\ngreater than 20, and we look to enter into a short trade ﬁve candles after the initial\nformation at 1.3390. Our initial stop is placed at the August 8 high of 1.3432. The\npair continues to move lower in the days and weeks that follow, and we remain in\nthe trade until the moving averages are no longer in perfect and the 10-day SMA\nmoves above the 20-day SMA, which occurs on October 17 when EURUSD settles\nthe day at 1.2758. The total proﬁt on this trade is 632 pips. We risked 42 pips on\nthe trade.\nThe next example is USDSGD. In Figure 16.2, the perfect order forms on\nNovember 6. We check and see that ADX is greater than 20, and we look to enter\ninto a long trade ﬁve candles after the initial formation at 1.2916. Our stop should\nbe at the November 6 low of 1.2911 but that is below our entry price so we put\nour stop at the 20-day SMA of 1.2822. The pair continues to move higher in the\nmonths that follow, and we remain in the trade until the moving averages are no\nlonger in perfect and the 10-day SMA moves below the 20-day SMA, which occurs\non March 27, when USD/SGD closes the day at 1.3685. The total move on this\ntrade is 770 pips for a risk of 89 pips.\nFigure 16.3 shows a perfect-order formation on a daily chart in USDJPY. The\nperfect order formed in October and when that occurred, we entered the trade\nﬁve days afterward at 116.20. Our stop was placed at 108.75, and we remained in\nthe trade until the 10-day SMA crossed below the 20-day SMA on December 19 at\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk145\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.1 EURUSD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk146\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.2 USDSGD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk147\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.3 USDJPY Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER148119.45. In this example, the proﬁt was 425 pips for a risk of 645 pips, which was\nfar from ideal.\nThe perfect order is a strategy that can be high proﬁt but low probability and\nlow frequency. This means there could be numerous stop outs before a long trend\nemerges. Also, when the currency pair moves more than 250 to 300 pips in proﬁt,\nyou may want to consider taking proﬁt on part of the positions.\n149CHAPTER 17\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nPairing Strong with\nWeak\nOne of the best ways to approach currency trading on a fundamental basis\nis to pair the strongest currency with the weakest. Of course ﬁnding that\npairing is rarely simple because it is not just about which countries are the strongest\nor weakest right now but instead which ones will become strong or weak going\nforward. Finding these currencies can also be challenging because we live in a global\neconomy where the health of one major economy will affect the outlook of another.\nYet buying a weak currency and selling a strong one unknowingly can be a big\nmistake that translates into large losses, so it is extremely important for forex traders\nto learn how to pair strong with weak to maximize returns. After doing so you can\nuse technical analysis to help identify points of entry in the direction of the trend.\nIn 2015, for example, the European Central Bank introduced quantitative easing\n(QE) as a last ditch effort to boost inﬂation and stimulate growth. We know that\nQE lowers interest rates and erodes the value of a currency but selling euros blindly\non March 9, 2015, when the central bank started buying bonds for the very ﬁrst\ntime, yielded only a short-lived decline in the currency. Instead it would have been\nsmarter to look for opportunities to sell the currency against a strong one on rallies.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK150\nFIGURE 17.1 EURGBP Daily Chart—Quantitative Easing\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 17.2 NZDCAD Daily Chart—Oil\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK151One good candidate at the time was the British pound, which was beneﬁting from\neconomic improvements and had a central bank that was moving closer to raising\nrates. Figure 17.1 shows how there was a lot of consolidation in EURGBP near\n74 cents prior to the launch of Eurozone quantitative easing. This level proved to\nbe resistance when the pair rallied in late March. Traders could have sold them,\nassuming that resistance would hold, or waited for the pair to revisit that level in\nApril and May.\nAnother way to pair strong with weak is to follow the direction of commodity\nprices. Oil prices bottomed at $43.46 in early 2015, having traded above $100 a\nbarrel only 8 months earlier and started to turn higher in March. As a major oil\nproducer, Canada would stand to beneﬁt from stabilization in crude prices. At the\ntime U.S. policy makers were talking about raising interest rates, the Australian\ndollar was beneﬁtting from improving domestic conditions, and sterling soared on\npositive data and a victory by the incumbent during the 2015 general election.\nSelling any of these currencies and buying the Canadian dollar would have been a\nrisky endeavor. Instead the best bet at th e time was to sell the New Zealand dollar\nand buy the Canadian dollar or the NZDCAD pair because New Zealand reported\nextremely weak labor data that prompted policy makers to talk about easing.

This unexpected\nchange drove EURUSD sharply higher, and buying breakouts in April and May as\nshown in Figure 17.3 would have been good bets.\n153CHAPTER 18\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nThe Leveraged\nCarry Trade\nThe leverage carry trade strategy is the quintessential global macro trade that\nhas long been one of the favorite strategies of hedge funds and investment\nbanks. On its most fundamental level, the carry trade strategy involves buying\na high-yielding currency and funding it with the sale of a low-yielding currency.\nAggressive speculators will leave the trade unhedged with the hope that the high\nyielding currency will appreciate in value relative to the lower yielding currency,\nallowing them to earn the interest rate differential on top of the capital appreciation.\nMore conservative investors may choose to hedge the exchange rate component,\nearning only the interest rate differential. Although the differentials tend to be small,\nusually 1 to 3 percent if the position is leveraged 5 to 10 times, the proﬁts from\ninterest rates alone can be substantial. Of course it is important to remember that\nwhile leverage can magnify proﬁts, it can also exacerbate losses. Capital appreciation\ngenerally occurs when a number of traders identify proﬁt opportunities and pile into\nthe same trade, driving up the value of the currency pair.\nIn foreign exchange trading, the carry trade is a popular way to take advantage\nof the notion that money ﬂows in and out of different markets, driven by the law\nof supply and demand: with markets offering higher rates of return on investment\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE154attracting the most capital. Countries are no different—in the world of international\ncapital ﬂows, nations that offer the highest interest rates will generally attract more\ninvestment creating greater demand for their currencies. This helps to fuel the\ncarry trade. The carry trade strategy is simple to master, but like all strategies,\nit contains risk. Carry trades perf ormed extremely well between 2000 and 2007,\nfailed miserably between 2008 and 2009, and recovered between late 2012 into\n2015. The chance of loss can be great if you do not understand how, why, and when\ncarry trades work best.\n■How Do Carry Trades Work?\nTo understand carry trading, it is important to ﬁrst understand that currencies are\nalways traded in pairs, so taking a carry trade involves buying a currency that offers\na high interest rate and simultaneously selling a currency that offers a low interest\nrate. Carry trades are proﬁtable when the exchange rate remains unchanged in\nvalue and investors are able to earn the d ifference in interes t—or spread—between\nthe two currencies, or when it appreciates in value, allowing the investor to earn\nthe spread along with capital appreciation. If the exchange rate falls by more than\nthe spread on the interest rate, it becomes a net loss for the investor.\nLet’s take a look at an example: Assume that the Australian dollar offers an\ninterest rate of 4.75%, while the Swiss franc offers an interest rate of 0.25%. To\nexecute the carry trade, an investor buys the Australian dollar and sells the Swiss\nfranc. In doing so, he or she can earn a proﬁt of 4.50% (2.75% in interest earned\nminus 0.25% in interest paid), as long as the exchange rate between Australian\ndollars and Swiss francs do not change. Figure 18.1 shows exactly how an investor\nwould execute the carry trade.\nLong Short\nBuy AUD\n4.75%Sell CHF\n0.25%Investor\nReceives: 4.75% from long AUD\nposition\nPays: 0.25% through short USD\nfunding position\nProfit: 4.50% in interest rate\nspread, assuming spot rate is \nconstantEnters long AUD/USD trade:\nFIGURE 18.1 Leveraged Carry Trade Example\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE155To summarize : A carry trade involves buying a currency that offers a high interest\nrate while selling a currency that offers a low interest rate.\n■Why Do Carry Trades Work?\nInterest rates are very important: Carry trades work because of the constant\nmovement of capital into and out of different countries in search of the highest yield.\nInterest rates are the main reason why some countries attract more investment\nthan others. There are three reasons why a country can pay a higher interest rate.\nFirst, if a country’s economy is doing well (high growth, high productivity, low\nunemployment, rising incomes, etc.), it will be able to offer those who invest in the\ncountry a higher rate of return. Second, central banks can raise interest rates on fast\ngrowing economies with rising inﬂation. Third, countries with high debt to GDP\nratios, low credit ratings, and/or inherent growth problems may also need to pay a\nhigher interest rate to attract investment.\nInvestors prefer to earn higher interest rates: Investors who are interested in\nmaximizing their proﬁts will naturally look for investments that offer them the\nhighest rate of return. When making a decision to invest in a particular currency, an\ninvestor is more likely to choose one that offers the highest rate of return, or in this\ncase, interest rate. If several investors make this exact same decision, the country\nwill experience an inﬂow of capital from those seeking to earn a high rate of return,\nand the currency should appreciate.\nWhat about countries that are not doing well economically? Countries that have\nlow growth and low productivity will not be able to offer investors a high rate of\nreturn unless they have a very poor credit rating and are forced to offer a higher\nrate to compensate for the risk of holding the country’s bond or currency. With\nmajor economies, however, there will be times where growth is so weak that\ninterest rates are brought to zero, providing investors with no meaningful return.\nThe difference between countries that offer h igh interest rates versus countries that\noffer low interest rates is what makes carry trades possible.\nLet’s take another look at the carry trade example above in more detail.\nImagine an investor in Switzerland who is earning an interest rate of 0.25% per\nyear on her bank deposit in Swiss francs. At the time, a bank in Australia is offering\n4.75% per year on a deposit of Australian dollars. Seeing that interest rates are much\nhigher with the Australian bank, this in vestor would like to ﬁnd a way to earn this\nhigher rate of interest on her money.\nNow imagine that the investor could somehow trade her deposit of Swiss francs\nby paying 0.25% for a deposit of Australian dollars paying 4.75%. What she has\neffectively done is to ‘‘sell’’ her Swiss franc deposit and use those funds to ‘‘buy’’ an\nAustralian dollar deposit. With this transaction, she now owns an Australian dollar\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE156Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.2 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 1\ndeposit that pays her 4.75% in interest per year, 4.50% more than she was earning\nwith her Swiss franc deposit.\nThis investor has essentially just done a carry trade by ‘‘buying’’ an Australian\ndollar deposit, and ‘‘selling’’ a Swiss franc deposit.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows out of\nSwitzerland and into Australia, as investors take their Swiss francs and convert them\ninto Australian dollars. Australia attracts more capital because of the higher rates it\noffers. This inﬂow of capital increases the value of the currency (see Figure 18.2).\nTo summarize : Carry trades are made possible by the differences in interest rates\nbetween countries. B ecause they prefer to ea rn higher interest ra tes, investors will\nlook to buy and hold high interest rate paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Work Best?\nThere will be times when carry trades work better than others. In fact, carry trades\nare the most proﬁtable when there is a very speciﬁc attitude toward risk.\n■How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take?\nThe moods of people in general change over time—sometimes they may feel more\ndaring and willing to take chances; other times they may be more timid and prone to\nconservativeness. Investors, as a group, are no different. Sometimes they are willing\nto make investments that involve a good amount of risk; other times they are more\nfearful of losses and look to invest in safer assets.\nIn ﬁnancial jargon, when investors as a whole are willing to take on risk, we\ncall this low risk aversion, which means they are in risk-seeking mode. Alternatively,\nwhen investors are drawn to more conservative investments and less willing to take\no nr i s k ,w ed e s c r i b et h e ma s risk-averse .\nCarry trades are the most proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion .T h i s\nnotion makes sense when you consider what a carry trade involves. Remember, a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE157carry trade involves buying a currency that pays a high interest rate while selling a\ncurrency that pays a low interest rate. In buying the high interest rate currency, the\ninvestor is taking a risk because it is believed that a country needs to offer a higher\ninterest rate to offset the risk of holding th e currency. Also, while high interest rates\nattract investment, they can also hurt growth by raising the cost of borrowing. This\ncreates uncertainty around whether the economy of the country will continue to\nperform well and be able to pay not just high but even higher interest rates. This\nrisk is something a carry trade investor must be willing to take.\nIf investors as a whole were not willing to take on this risk, then capital would\nnever move from one country to another, and the carry trade opportunity would\nnot exist. Therefore, in order to return, carry trades require that investors as a\ngroup have low risk aversion, or be willing to bear the risk of investing in the higher\ninterest rate currency.\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the most proﬁtable when investors are willing\nto bear the risk of investing in high interest paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Not Work?\nSo far, we have shown that a carry trade will work best when investors have low\nrisk aversion. What happens when investors have high risk aversion ?\nCarry trades are the least proﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion .W h e n\ninvestors have high risk aversion, they are less willing as a group to take chances\nwith their investments. This means they would be less willing to invest in riskier\ncurrencies that offer higher interest rates. Instead, when investors have high risk\naversion they would actually prefer to put their money in ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies\nthat pay lower interest rates. During this time, they may also opt to close or unwind\ntheir carry trades. In doing so, they would be buying the currency with the low\ninterest rate and selling the curre ncy with the high interest rate.\nReturning to our earlier example, let’s assume the investor suddenly feels\nuncomfortable holding the foreign currency, the Australian dollar. Now, instead of\nlooking for the higher interest rate, she is more interested in keeping her investment\nsafe. As a result, she swaps her Australian dollars for more familiar Swiss francs.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows\nout of Australia and into Switzerland as investors take their Australian dollars and\nconvert them into Swiss francs. During this period of risk aversion, Switzerland\nattracts more capital due to the perceived safety of its currency, and the inﬂow of\ncapital increases the value of the Swiss franc (see Figure18.3).\nWhen investors have high risk aversion, they prefer to avoid the riskier high\ninterest rate paying currency and instea d invest in the safer, lower interest rate\npaying currency, which is the opposite of a carry trade.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE158Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.3 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 2\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the least proﬁtable in periods of uncertainty\nwhen investors are unwilling to bear the risk of investing in high interest paying\ncurrencies.\n■The Importance of Risk Aversion\nCarry trades will generally be proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion, and\nunproﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion. So before placing a carry trade\nit is important to understand the risk environment—whether investors as a whole\nhave high or low risk aversion—and when it changes .\nRising risk aversion is generally beneﬁcial for low interest rate paying currencies:\nSometimes the mood of investors will change rapidly, and investors’ willingness\nto make risky trades can change dramatically from one moment to the next.\nOften, these large shifts are caused by signiﬁcant global events. When periods\nof risk aversion occur quickly, the result is generally a large capital inﬂow into\nlow-interest-rate-paying ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies (see Figure 18.2).\nFor example, in the summer of 1998 the Japanese yen appreciated against the\ndollar by more than 20% over the span of two months, due to the Russian debt\ncrisis and LTCM hedge fund bailout. Similarly, just after the September 11 terrorist\nattacks the Swiss franc rose by more than 7% against the dollar over a 10-day period.\nDuring the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, we also saw big gains in the yen and the\nSwiss franc.\nThese sharp movements in currency values often occur when risk aversion quickly\nchanges from low to high. As a result, when risk aversion shifts, a carry trade can\nturn from being proﬁtable to unproﬁtable very quickly.\nRisk Aversion and Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nAs investor risk aversion goes from high to low, carry trades become more proﬁtable\nas detailed in Figure 18.4.\nHow do you know if investors as a whole have high or low risk aversion?\nUnfortunately, it is difﬁcult to measure investor risk aversion with a single number.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE1591 .

Low-interest currencies\ntend to remain weak, used in \nfinancing risky trades(–)( +)\nFIGURE 18.4 Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nOne way to get a broad idea of risk aversion levels is to look at bond yields. The\nwider the spread between the yields of bonds from different countries with similar\ncredit ratings, the higher the investor risk aversion. Bond yields are readily available\non major ﬁnancial websites such as Bloomberg.com and Reuters.com. In addition,\nseveral large banks have developed their own measures of risk aversion that signal\nwhen investors are willing to take risk and when they are not.\nOther Things to Bear in Mind When Considering a Carry Trade\nWhile risk aversion is one of the most important things to consider before making\na carry trade, it is not the only one. The following are some additional issues to be\naware of.\nLow Interest Rate Currency Appreciation\nBy entering into a carry trade, an investor is able to earn a proﬁt from the interest\nrate difference, or spread, between a high interest rate currency and a low interest\nrate currency. However, the carry trade can turn unproﬁtable if for some reason\n(like the risk aversion examples earlier), the low interest rate currency appreciates\nby a signiﬁcant amount.\nAside from rising risk aversion, improving economic conditions within a low\ninterest paying country can also cause its currency to appreciate. An ideal carry trade\nwill involve a low interest currency whose economy is weak and has low expectations\nfor growth. If the economy were to improve, however, the country might then be\nable to offer investors a higher rate of return through increased interest rates. If this\nwere to occur—again, using the previous example, say that Switzerland increased\nthe interest rates it offered—then investors may take advantage of these higher rates\nby investing in Swiss francs. As seen in Figure 18.3, an appreciation of the Swiss franc\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE160would negatively affect the proﬁtability of the Australian dollar–Swiss franc carry\ntrade. (At the very least, higher interest rates in Switzerland would negatively affect\nthe carry trade’s proﬁtability by lowering the interest rate spread.)\nThis same sequence of events may currently be unfolding for the Japanese yen.\nGiven its zero interest rates, the Jap anese yen has for a very long time been an\nideal low interest rate currency to use in carry trades (known as yen carry trades ).\nThis situation however, may be changing. Increased optimism about the Japanese\neconomy has recently led to an increase in the Japanese stock market. Increased\ninvestor demand for Japanese stocks and currency has caused the yen to appreciate,\nand this yen appreciation negatively affects the proﬁtability of carry trades like\nAustralian dollar (high interest rate) versus Japanese yen.\nIf investors continue to buy the yen, the yen carry trade could start to become\nunproﬁtable. This further illustrates the fact that when the low interest rate currency\nin a carry trade (the currency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the\nproﬁtability of the overall carry trade position.\nTrade Balances\nA country’s trade balance (the differen ce between imports and exports) can also\naffect the proﬁtability of a carry trade. We know that when investors have low\nrisk aversion or are risk seeking, capital will ﬂow from the low interest rate paying\ncurrency to the high interest rate paying currency (see Figure 18.2) but this does\nnot always happen.\nOne reason is because countries with large trade surplus can still see their\ncurrencies appreciate in low risk environments because running a trade surplus\nmeans that the country exports more than it imports. This creates naturally demand\nfor the currency.\nThe point of this example is to show that even when investors have low risk\naversion, large trade imbalances can cause a low interest rate currency to appreciate\n(as in Figure 18.3). And when the low interest rate currency in a carry trade (the\ncurrency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the proﬁtability of the carry\ntrade.\nTime Horizon\nIn general, a carry trade is a long-term strategy. Before entering into a carry trade,\nan investor should be willing to commit to a time-horizon of at least six months. This\ncommitment helps to make sure that the trade will not be affected by the ‘‘noise’’\nof shorter-term currency price movements.\nTo summarize : Carry trade investors should be aware of factors such as currency\nappreciation, trade balances, and time horizon before placing a trade. Any or all of\nthese factors can cause a seemingly proﬁtable carry trade to become unproﬁtable.\n161CHAPTER 19\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nMacro Event Driven\nTrade\nShort-term traders are generally focused only on the economic release of the\nweek and how it will impact their day trading activities. This works well for\nmany traders, but it is also important not to lose sight of the big macro events\nthat may be brewing in the economy or the world for that matter. Large-scale\nmacroeconomic events will move markets and will move them in very big ways.\nTheir impact goes beyond a simple one- or two-day price change because depending\non their size and scope, these occurrences have the potential to reshape the\nfundamental perception toward a currency for months or even years at a time.\nEvents such as wars, political uncertainly, natural disasters, and major international\nmeetings or monetary policy changes are so potent due to their irregularity that they\ncan have widespread psychological and physical impacts on the currency market.\nWith these events come both currencies that appreciate vastly and currencies that\ndepreciate just as dramatically. Therefore, keeping on top of global developments,\nunderstanding the underlying direction of market sentiment before and after these\nevents occur and anticipating them could be very proﬁtable, or at least can help\nprevent signiﬁcant losses.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE162■Know When Big Events Occur: Here Is a List\nof a Few Important Ones\n■Signiﬁcant G7 ﬁnance ministers meetings\n■Presidential elections\n■Important summits\n■Major Central Bank meetings\n■Potential changes to currency regimes\n■Possible debt defaults by large countries\n■Possible wars as a result of rising geopolitical tensions\n■Federal Reserve chairman’s semiannual testimony on economy\nThe best way to highlight the signiﬁcance of these events is look at a few notable\nmacroeconomic examples from the past two decades.\n2014 Ukraine–Russia Crisis\nThe 2014 Ukraine–Russia crisis was one of the biggest geopolitical events of the\npast decade. The crisis began in 2013 but didn’t really hit its peak until March\n2014 when Russia signed a bill to absorb Crimea. Leading up to the announcement,\nthe uncertainty put signiﬁcant pressure on the EURUSD in January 2014 with the\ncurrency pair dropping sharply on March 18, 2014, the day that Russia declared that\nCrimea was now ofﬁcially apart of their country. This led to a few more weeks of\ndownward pressure for the EURUSD as shown in Figure 19.1 as investors awaited\nthe world’s response. Many nations declared their support for Ukraine and war was\nfeared, but eventually Russia was only hit with sanctions, and a few months later,\nthe Ukraine crisis moved to the back burner.\nEuropean Sovereign Debt Crisis (2009–2013)\nThe European Sovereign Debt Crisis started in 2009 and lasted into 2013 with the bulk\nof the damage being done by February 2012. It was a multiyear debt crisis that was\nsparked by the inability of many member nations to meet their debt obligations after\nthe global ﬁnancial crisis. Their banking sectors and economies suffered signiﬁcant\nlosses, and persistently negative growth prospects made it impossible for countries\nsuch as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus to repay or reﬁnance their government\ndebt. Between 2010 and 2012, all of these na tions required bailouts or some form\nof support from the Troika, composed of the ECB, IMF and European Commission.\nWhile the problems were concentrated in smaller Eurozone nations, there was fear\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE163\nFIGURE 19.1 EURUSD Ukraine Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE164\nFIGURE 19.2 EURUSD Sovereign Debt Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nof contagion for the major economies. The country of Spain did not require a bailout\nbut in 2012, a number of banks required additional funding. The crisis posed caused\nsigniﬁcant volatility for the euro. Figure 19.2 shows two long periods of EURUSD\nweakness that were caused by bailouts, downgrades, and other negative headlines.\nGlobal Financial Crisis (2007–2009), Subprime\nOne of the most important macroeconomic events of the twenty-ﬁrst century was\nthe 2007 to 2009 subprime/global ﬁnancial crisis. It was triggered by a sharp slide\nin house prices, default on mortgages, and blowup of subprime mortgage backed\nsecurities and collateralized debt obligations. This, in turn, caused massive losses for\nbanks and ﬁnancial institutions, leading the failure of major ﬁrms such as Lehman\nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns. The impact on the ﬁnancial market and\nthe economy was staggering, with many countries falling into recession. During this\nperiod, the stock market lost more than 50% of its value with the S&P 500, falling\nfrom a high of 1,565 in October 2007 to a low of 676 in March 2009. As shown in\nFigure 19.3, USDJPY dropped from a high of 116.47 in October 2007 to a low of\n87.13 in January 2009. This was only the beginning of a multiyear decline for the\ncurrency pair. EURUSD had a delayed reaction, rallying strongly between October\n2007 and April 2008 as money ﬂowed out of the U.S. economy, and then falling\nsharply between July 2008 and October 2008 as the risk aversion and crisis spread\nto Europe.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE165\nFIGURE 19.3 USDJPY Global Financial Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nPolitical Uncertainty: 2004 U.S. Presidential Election\nAnother example of major events impacting the currency market is the 2004 U.S.\npresidential elections. In general, political instability causes perceived weakness\nin currencies. The hotly contested presidential election in November of 2004,\ncombined with the differences in the candidates’ stance on the growing budget\ndeﬁcit, resulted in overall dollar bearishness. The sentiment was exacerbated even\nfurther, given the lack of international support for the incumbent President (Bush)\ndue to the administration’s decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein. As a result, in\nthe three weeks leading up to the election, the euro rose 600 pips against the U.S.\ndollar. This can be seen in Figure 19.4. With a Bush victory becoming increasingly\nclear and later conﬁrmed, the dollar sold off against the majors as the market looked\nahead to what would probably end up being the maintenance of status quo. On the\nday following the election, the EURUSD rose another 200 pips and then continued\nto rise an additional 700 pips before peaking out six weeks later. This entire move\ntook place over the course of two months, which may seem like an eternity for\nmany, but this macroeconomic event really shaped the markets and for those who\nwere following it, big proﬁts could have been made. However, this is important\neven for short-term traders because given that the market was bearish dollars in\ngeneral leading up to the U.S. presidential election, a more prudent trade would be\nto look for opportunities to buy the EURUSD on dips rather than trying sell rallies\nand look for tops.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE166\nPost Election -\nAnother 700\nPip Rally \n600 Pip Rally\nPre Election\n2004 Election\nNight\nFIGURE 19.4 EURUSD Election Trade\nSource: eSignal\nG7 Meeting Dubai September 2003\nThe G7 ﬁnance ministers meeting on September 22, 2003, was a very important\nturning point for the markets. The dollar collapsed signiﬁcantly following the meeting\nat which the G7 ﬁnance ministers wanted to see ‘‘more ﬂexibility in exchange rates.’’\nDespite the rather tame nature of these words, the market interpreted this line to be\na major shift in policy. The last time changes to this degree had been made was back in\n2000. Taking a step back, the countries that constitute the G7 are the United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, and France. Collectively, these\ncountries account for two-thirds of the world’s total economic output. Not all G7\nmeetings are important. The only time the market really hones in on the G7 ﬁnance\nministers meeting is when they expect big changes to be made to the statement. In\n2000, the market paid particular attention to the upcoming meeting because there\nwas strong intervention in the EURUSD the day before the meeting. The meeting\nin September 2003 was also important because the U.S. trade deﬁcit was ballooning\nand becoming a huge issue. The EURUSD bore the brunt of the dollar depreciation\nwhile Japan and China were intervening aggressively in their currencies. As a result,\nit was widely expected that the G7 ﬁnance ministers as a whole would issue a\nstatement that was highly critical of Japan and China’s intervention policies. Leading\nup to the meeting, the U.S. dollar had alre ady begun to sell off as indicated by the\nchart. At the time of the announcement, the EURUSD shot up 150 pips. Though\nthis initial move was not ve ry substantial, between Se ptember 2003 and February\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE167\n6% Rally\n14% Rally\nSept 22, 2003\nG7 Meeting\nFIGURE 19.5 EURUSD G7 Meeting\nSource: eSignal\n2004 (which was the next G7 meeting), the dollar fell 8% on a trade-weighted\nbasis, 9% against the British pound, 11% against the euro, 7% against the yen,\nand 1.5% against the Canadian dollar. To put the percentages into perspective, a\nmove of 11% is equivalent to approximately 1100 pips. Therefore, the longer-term\nimpact is much more signiﬁcant than the immediate impact as the event itself has the\nsigniﬁcance to change the overall sentiment in the market. Figure 19.5 is a weekly\nchart of the EURUSD that illustrates how the currency pair performed following\nthe September 22, 2003 G7 meeting.\nU.S. War Against Iraq\nGeopolitical risks such as wars can also have a pronounced impact on the currency\nmarket. Figure 19.6 shows that bet ween December 2002 and February 2003, the\ndollar depreciated 9% against the Swiss franc (USDCHF) in the months leading up\nto war. The dollar sold off because the war itself was incredibly unpopular among\nthe international community. The Swiss franc was one of the primary beneﬁciaries\ndue to the country’s political neutrality an d safe-haven status. Between February\nand March, traders began to believe that the inevitable war would turn into a quick\nand decisive U.S. victory, so they began to unwind the war trade. This eventually\nled to a 3% rally in USDCHF as investors exited their short dollar positions.\nEach of these events caused large-scale movements in the currency market. Such\nevents are clearly important to follow for all types of traders. Keeping abreast of\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE168\nFIGURE 19.6 USDCHF Iraq War\nSource: eSignal\nbroad macroeconomic events can help traders make smarter decisions and prevent\nthem from fading large factors that may be brewing in the background. Most of\nthese events are talked about, debated, and anticipated many months in advance by\neconomists, currency analysts, and the international community in general.\n169CHAPTER 20\nQuantitative Easing\nand Its Impact on\nForex\nQuantitative easing is such an important topic that it deserves its own chapter.\nAfter the global ﬁnancial crisis many countries fell into recession, and in\nresponse central banks around the world lowered interest rates to record lows.\nWhen rates could not fall any lower, they had to resort to unprecedented measures,\nthe most powerful of which was quantit ative easing (QE). Between 2007 and 2015,\nthe Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and\nthe Swedish National Bank all resorted to QE, and their decision had a signiﬁcant\nimpact on their currencies on both a short- and long-term basis.\nThe goal of quantitative easing is to keep yields low and to ﬂood the market\nwith liquidity. To do so, a central bank would create money by buying ﬁnancial\nassets such as government bonds from banks using electronic cash. This basically\n‘‘creates new money.’’ It also keeps yields low because bond prices have an inverse\nrelationship with yields and in giving banks money, the hope is that it will encourage\nlending and in turn lead to more economic activity. The jury is out on how\nmuch QE really helped these economies, but the inﬂuence on currencies was\nundeniable.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX170■U.S. Quantitative Easing\nAfter the ﬁnancial crisis, the ﬁrst major central bank to respond with quantitative\neasing was the U.S. Federal Reserve. In November 2008, the central bank launched\na $600 billion bond-buying program. The program was initially effective as the\neconomy improved, prompting the Fed to temporarily halt bond purchases.\nHowever, the economy never gained additional momentum and as such, the central\nbank returned with a second round of QE (dubbed QE2) in November 2010. The\nsize of the program matched the ﬁrst round. Unfortunately, more bond buys were\nneeded, and QE3 was launched in September 2012. Unlike QE1 and QE2, QE3\nwas an open-ended program. The central bank announced plans to purchase $40\nbillion in assets every month, and in December 2012, that amount was increased\nto $85 billion per month. The program lasted for ﬁve years, and purchases were\nﬁnally halted in October 2014. Figure 20.1 shows how each round of quantitative\neasing impacted the EURUSD. As you can see, each round triggered a sharp rise in\nEURUSD and—another way to look at it—weakness in the U.S. dollar. In 2008,\nthe month that QE1 was announced, EURUSD surged 17% from high to low.\nWhen QE2 was announced, the EURUSD began a rally that took the pair up more\nthan 20%. QE3 led to a similar uptrend with gains extended when the program\nwas increased.\n■UK Quantitative Easing\nQuantitative easing was launched by the Bank of England in March 2009. At the\ntime, the BoE pledged to spend 75 billion pounds over a three-month period buying\nUK assets, but the program continue d and between March 2009 and January 2010,\nthe central bank had spent 200 billion pounds. In October 2011, growth started to\nslow more dramatically with the economy facing a double dip recession. In response\npolicymakers voted to increase the QE program by another 75 billion. In February\n2012, the central bank added another 50 billion and the same increase was made in\nJuly 2012, bringing the total program to 375 billion pounds. Figure 20.2 shows how\nGBPUSD responded to each round of QE. What is interesting is that the sterling\nfell sharply in the run up to the March 2009 announcement. It extended lower\nafterward but rebounded in the months that followed. In 2011, 2012, and 2013,\nthe sterling rallied the month that QE was announced. One important thing to\nremember is that the Federal Reserve was also buying bonds and expanding its own\nQE program at the time, so the two offset each other to some degree, limiting the\nreaction in GBPUSD. More importantly, investors interpreted each round of BoE\nQE as positive for the currency because they hoped that the central bank’s efforts\nwould help to turn around the economy.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk171\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.1 EURUSD US Fed QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk172\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.2 GBPUSD UK BoE QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk173\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.3 USDJPY Japan BoJ QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk174\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.4 EURUSD EZ ECB QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX175■Japan Quantitative Easing\nThe phrase quantitative easing was ﬁrst used by the Bank of Japan in 2001. At the time,\nthey did not believe that the program was effective but after the ﬁnancial crisis, they\nsaid they would examine their asset purchase program. In October 2011 the Bank of\nJapan increased the program by 5 trillion yen which was a small sum (approximately\nUSD$66 billion) compared to the staggering amounts that other countries were\npurchasing. Then in April 2013, they announced a bold and aggressive plan to\nbuy 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen a year as part of Prime Minister Abe’s economic\npolicies. This program was later expanded to 80 billion yen a year. Unlike other\ncountries where the effectiveness of QE was debated, Japan’s bond buying program\nplayed a large role in turning around the economy. It also had a signiﬁcant impact\non the currency. In Figure 20.3 we show how the ﬁrst program yielded a very small\nresponse in USDJPY but when the Bank of Japan came out in size, USDJPY reacted\nquickly and aggressively with a move that extended even further when the program\nwas expanded.\n■Eurozone Quantitative Easing\nThe European Central Bank was the last major central bank to roll out quantitative\neasing. They were reluctant to do so for a very long time because structurally the\nEurozone is not set up for quantitative easing. Since there is no euro-bond, some\ncritics felt that it was not in line with the central bank’s mandate. However faced\nwith sluggish growth, stubbornly low inﬂation, and an interest rate already at zero,\nthe ECB had very few options. They publicly discussed the option months before the\nactual decision, giving the market plenty of opportunity to discount the move. In\nJanuary 2015, the ECB announced that they would spend 60 billion euros per month\nbuying private and public bonds. In March 2015, ECB President Draghi unveiled\nan aggressive 1 trillion quantitative easing program. As shown in Figure 20.4, both\nannouncements had a signiﬁcant impact on the currency, but EURUSD stabilized\nafter the second announcement (but only after falling 500 pips) because investors\nhoped that the aggressive program by the central bank would help turn around\nthe economy.\nWhile no additional quantitative easing programs are expected as of mid-2015,\nthe unwinding of these unprecedented measures in the coming years should have\njust as much impact on currencies as the initial announcement itself, providing an\nopportunity for forex traders."

        "187CHAPTER 23\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nRisk Reversals\nRisk reversals are a useful fundamental-based tool to add to your mix of trading\nindicators. One of the weaknesses of currency trading is the lack of volume data\nand accurate indicators for gauging sentiment. The only publicly available report\non positioning is the Commitment of Traders Report published by the Commodity and\nFutures Commission. Unfortunately, this report is released with a three-day delay.\nA useful alternative is to use risk reversals—which are provided on a real-time basis\non the FXCM News Plugin , under options, or on the Bl oomberg/Reuters terminals.\nAs we ﬁrst introduced in Chapter 7, a risk reversal consists of a pair of options\nfor the same currency (a call and a put). Based on put–call parity, these far out of\nthe money options (25 delta) with the same expiration and strike price should also\nhave the same implied volatility. However, in reality, this is not true. Sentiment is\nembedded in volatilities, which makes risk reversals a good tool to gauge market\nsentiment. A number strongly in favor of calls or puts indicates that there is more\ndemand for calls than puts. The opposite is also true; a number strongly in favor of\nputs over calls indicates that there is a premium built in put options as a result of the\nhigher demand. If risk reversals are near zero, it indicates that there is indecision\namong bulls and bears and that there is no strong bias in the markets.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS1884/28–1 .50–1 .00–0.500.00RR %0.501. 0 01. 5 02.00\n7/7 3/290.910.99\n0.97\n0.95\n0.93\n0.89\n0.87\n0.85\n0.83\n0.81\n0.79\n0.77\nEURUSD\n0.75\n1/18 11/9RRs Spot\n8/31 6/22 4/13 2/2 11/24 9/15EURUSD and Risk Reversals\nFIGURE 23.1 EURUSD Risk Reversal Chart\n■What Does a Risk Reversal Table Look Like?\nWe showed this table before in Chapter 7, but want to present it again to make\nsure that it is understood well (see Figure 23.1). Each of the abbreviations for the\ncurrency options are listed; and as indicated, most risk reversals are near zero,\nwhich reﬂects no major bias for puts or calls. However, for USDJPY, the longer-\nterm risk reversals indicate that the market is strongly favoring yen calls (JC) and\ndollar puts.\n■How Can You Use This Information?\nFor easier graphing and tracking purposes, we use positive and negative integers\nfor calls and put premiums respectively. A positive number indicates that calls\nare preferred over puts and that the market as a whole anticipates an upward\nmovement in the underlying currency. Likewise, a negative number indicates that\nputs are preferred over calls and that the market is expecting a down-move in the\nunderlying currency. Used prudently, risk reversals can be a valuable tool in judging\nmarket positioning. While the signals generated by a risk reversal system will not\nbe completely accurate, they can help investors judge whether the market is bullish\nor bearish.\nRisk reversals become particularly important when the values are at extreme\nlevels. We identify extreme levels as one standard deviation plus or minus the average\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS189risk reversal. When risk reversals are at these levels, they give off contrarian signals,\nindicating that a currency pair is overbought or oversold based upon sentiment.\nThe indicator is perceived as a contrarian signal because when the entire market\nis positioned for a rise in a given currency, it makes it harder for the currency to\nrally and easier for it to fall on negative news or events. As a result, a strongly\nnegative number implies oversold conditions whereas a strongly negative number\nwould imply overbought conditions. Although the buy or sell signals produced by\nrisk reversals are not perfect, they can convey additional information used to make\ntrading decisions.\nExamples\nTake a look at our ﬁrst example of the EURUSD (Figure 23.1). Visually, you can see\nthat 25 delta risk reversals have been a leading indicator for EURUSD price action.\nWhen risk reversals plunged to –1.39 o n September 30, it was a signal that the\nmarket had a strong bearish bias. This proved to be a reliable contrarian indicator\nof what eventually became a 300-pip rebound in the EURUSD over the course of\nnine days. When prices spiked once again almost immediately to 0.67 in favor of a\ncontinuation of the up move, the EURUSD proved bulls wrong by engaging in an\neven deeper selloff. Although there were many instances of risk reversals signaling\ncontra-trend moves on a smaller scale, the next major spike came a year later. On\nAugust 16, risk reversals were at 1.43, which meant that bullish sentiment hit a\nvery high level. This preceded a 260-pip drop in the EURUSD over the course of\nthree weeks. When risk reve rsals spiked once again a month later to 1.90, we saw\nanother top in the EURUSD, which later became a much deeper descent.\nGBP/USD\n1. 7 0\n1. 6 5\n1. 6 0\n1. 5 5\n1. 5 0\n1. 4 5\n1. 4 0\n1. 3 5\n1. 3 0\nNov-00 Apr-01 Oct-01 Mar-02 Sep-02 Feb-03 Aug-031. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.0\n–0.5\n–1 .0GBP/USD Sell\nBuy RR %RR %\nBuy\nFIGURE 23.2 GBPUSD Risk Reversal Chart\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: RISK REVERSALS190The next example is the GBPUSD. As can be seen in Figure 23.2, risk reversals\ndo a very good job of identifying extreme overbought and oversold conditions. Buy\nand sell levels are added to the GBPUSD chart for further clariﬁcation of how risk\nreversals can also be used to time market turns. With the lack of price volume data\nto give us a sense of where the market is positioned, risk reversals can be helpful in\ngauging general market sentiment.\n191CHAPTER 24\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nUsing Option\nVolatilities to Time\nMarket Movements\nUsing option volatilities to time foreign exchange spot movement is a topic that\nwe touched on brieﬂy in Chapter 7. This strategy warrants a more detailed\nexplanation because it has long been a favorite for professional traders and hedge\nfunds. Volatility can be deﬁned as a measure of a currency’s expected ﬂuctuation\nover a given time period based on past price ﬂuctuations. This is typically calculated\nby taking the historic annual standard deviation of daily price changes. Future prices\nhelp to determine implied volatility, which is used to calculate option premiums.\nAlthough this sounds fairly complicated, its application is not. Basically, option\nvolatilities measure the rate and magnitude of a currency’s price over a given period\nof time based on historical ﬂuctuations. Therefore, if the average daily trading range\nof the EURUSD contracted from 100 pips to 60 pips and stayed there for two\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY192weeks, in all likelihood, short- term volatility also contra cted signiﬁcantly compared\nto longer-term volatility during the same time period.\n■How to Use Option Volatilities to Trade Forex\nAs a guideline, there are two simple rules to follow. The ﬁrst one is that if\nshort-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly lower than long-term volatilities, one\nshould expect a breakout, though the direction of the breakout will not be deﬁned\nby this rule. Lastly, if short-term option volatilities are signiﬁcantly higher than\nlong-term volatilities, one should expect a reversion to range trading.\nWhy Does This Technique Work?\nDuring a period of consolidation, implied option volatilities are either low or on\nthe decline. The inspiration for these rules is that in periods of range trading, there\ntends to be little movement. We care most about when option volatilities drop\nsharply, which could be a sign that a proﬁtable break is underway. When short-term\nvolatility is above long-term volatility, it means that near-term price action is more\nvolatile than the long-term average price action. This suggests that the ranges will\neventually contract back toward average levels. The trend is most noticeable in\nempirical data. Below are a few examples of how this rule predicted breakouts\nthat turned into new trends but before analyzing the charts, it is important to note\nthat we use one-month volatilities as our short-term volatilities and three-month\nvolatilities as our long-term volatilities.\nIn Figure 24.1, the one-month volatility of GBPUSD is generally close to three-\nmonth volatilities. However, the ﬁrst arrow shows an instance where short-term\nvolatility spiked above long-term volatility during a period of GBPUSD weakness.\nThis signaled a correction or relief rally in the currency pair and that was exactly\nwhat we saw in September when the GBPUSD bounced more than 200 pips. The\nsecond arrow shows an instance where short-term volatility spiked well below\nlong-term volatility and that foreshadowed a major breakdown in the currency pair.\nIn this case, GBPUSD dropped over 600 pips after a period of consolidation.\nIn Figure 24.2 we have a chart of USDJPY. Like GBPUSD, the one-month and\nthree-month option volatilities move very closely. However in May, one-month\nvolatilities dropped sharply below three-month volatilities and that foreshadowed\nthe ﬁrst breakout in more than two months.\nWho Can Beneﬁt from This Technique?\nThis strategy is not only useful for breakout traders, but range traders can also utilize\nthis information for their trading.

After eyeing a historical\nrange, traders should look at volatiliti es to estimate the likelihood that the spot\nprice will remain within this range. Should the trader decide to go long or short\nthis range, he or she should continue to monitor volatility as long as he or she has\nan open position in the pair to assist them in determining when to close out that\nposition. If short-term volatilities fall well below long-term volatilities, the trader\nshould consider closing their position if the suspected breakout is not in their favor.\nThe potential break is likely to work in the favor of the trader if the current spot\nis close to the limit and far from the stop. In this hypothetical situation, it may be\nproﬁtable to move limit prices away from current spot prices to increase proﬁts\nfrom the potential break. If the spot price is close to the stop price and far from the\nlimit price, the break is likely to work against the trader, and the trader should close\nhis or her position immediately.\nBreakout traders can monitor volatilities to verify a breakout. If traders suspect\na breakout, he or she can verify this breakout though implied volatilities. Should\nimplied volatility be constant or rising, there is a higher probability that the currency\nwill continue to trade in range than if vola tility is low or falling. In other words,\nbreakout traders should look for short-term volatilities to be signiﬁcantly lower than\nlong-term volatilities before making a breakout trade.\nAside from being a key component for pricing, option volatilities can also be\na useful tool for forecasting market activities. Option volatilities measure the rate\nand magnitude of the changes in a currency’ s prices. Implied option volatilities, on\nthe other hand, measure the expected ﬂuctuation of a currency’s price over a given\nperiod of time based on historical ﬂuctuations.\n■Tracking Volatilities on Your Own\nVolatility tracking typically involves taking the historic annual standard deviation of\ndaily price changes. Generally speaking, we use three-month volatilities for long-\nterm volatilities numbers and one-month volatilities for the short term. Volatilities\ncan be found on Bloomberg or Reuters.\nThe next step is to start compiling a list of data with the date, currency pair price,\nimplied one-month volatility, and implie d three-month volatility for the various\ncurrency pairs in Excel. It might also be beneﬁcial to ﬁnd the difference between the\none-month and three-month volatilities to look for large differentials or to calculate\none-month volatility as a percentage of three-month volatility.\nOnce a sufﬁcient amount of data is compiled, one can graph the data as a visual\naid. The graph should use two y-axes, with spot prices on one and short- and\nlong-term volatilities on the other. If desired, the differences in short- and long-term\nvolatilities can be graphed as well in a separate, single y-axis graph.\n195CHAPTER 25\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nIntervention\nIntervention by central banks is one of the most important short- and long-term\nfundamentally driven market movers for the currency market. For short-term\ntraders, intervention can lead to sharp intraday movements on the scale of 150–250\npips in a matter of minutes. For longer-term traders, intervention can signal a\nsigniﬁcant change in trend because it suggests that the central bank is shifting or\nsolidifying its stance and sending a message to the market that they are backing certain\ndirectional move in their currency. There are basically two types of intervention:\nsterilized and unsterilized. Sterilized intervention requires offsetting intervention\nwith the buying or selling of government bonds while unsterilized intervention\ninvolves no changes to the monetary base to offset intervention. Many argue that\nunsterilized intervention has a more lasting effect on the currency than sterilized\nintervention.\nTaking a look at some of the following case studies, it is apparent that interventions\nin general are important to watch and can have large impacts on a currency pair’s\nprice action. Although the actual timing of an intervention tends to be a surprise,\nquite often the market will begin talking about the need for intervention days or\nweeks before the actual intervention occurs. The direction of an intervention is\nalmost always known in advance because the central bank will typically come across\nthe newswires complaining about too much strength or weakness in their currency.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION196These warnings give traders a window of opportunity to participate in what could\nbe signiﬁcant proﬁt potentials or to stay out of the markets. The only thing to watch\nout for, which you will see in our case study is that the sharp intervention based\nrallies or selloffs can quickly be reversed as speculators come into the market to\n‘‘fade the central bank.’’ Whether or not the market fades, the central bank depends\non the frequency of central bank intervention, the success rate, the magnitude of\nthe intervention, the timing of the intervention, and whether fundamentals support\nintervention. Intervention is much more prevalent in emerging market currencies\nthan in the G7 currencies because these countries need to prevent their local\ncurrencies from appreciating too signiﬁcantly such that it would hinder economic\nrecovery and reduce the competitiveness of the country’s exports. Nonetheless, G7\ninterventions will happen and its rarity is exactly what makes them signiﬁcant.\n■Japan\nIn the past two decades, the central bank most willing to engage intervention is the\nBank of Japan. As an export dependent country, a strong yen poses a major risk to\nthe export sector. While the Bank of Japan conducts the intervention, the decision\nis made by the Ministry of Finance. The most recent case of intervention by the\nJapanese gover nment was in 2011. The BoJ largely s tayed out of the market between\n2012 and 2015 because Abenomics helped to drive a recovery in the economy. On\nOctober 31, 2011, USDJPY hit a record low, which means that the Japanese yen hit\na record high. Frustrated with the currency’s strength after the 2011 earthquake and\ntsunami, the Japanese government came into the forex market aggressively to sell\nthe yen and buy the dollar. On that day, their intervention efforts drove USDJPY\nfrom a low of 75.575 to a high of 79.50, almost 400 pips. As shown in Figure 25.1,\n90% of this move happened in the ﬁrst 35 minutes.\n75.0076.0077.0078.0079.0080.00\n14:00\n16:26\n17:56\n19:27\n21:01\n22:32\n0:03\n1:34\n3:09\n4:40\n6:11\n7:42\n9:29\n17:18\n1:24\n9:29\n17:37\n1:42\n9:48\n17:37\n2:01\n10:06USDJPY Oct 31, 2011\nFIGURE 25.1 USDJPY Chart\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION197The Bank of Japan also bought USDJPY in August 2011, but one of their biggest\nintervention programs was in March 2011, when central banks around the world\njoined the BoJ to sell the yen as a sign of solidarity after an earthquake and tsunami\ndrove the currency to a record high. On that day, intervention only drove USDJPY\nfrom 79.18 to 82, but a few weeks later it hit a high of 85.50, as shown in Figure 25.2.\nThe Bank of Japan also intervened in September 2015 and as shown in Figure 25.3,\na daily chart, USDJPY jumped nearly 300 pips that day. Typically, USDJPY will\nmove 75 to 150 pips on an average day, so a 300-pip move that happens in minutes\nis signiﬁcant. In all but one of these four cases, the intervention move was reversed\nalmost immediately. The only reason why USDJPY extended its rally in March 2011\nwas because the intervention was coordinated with other central banks, making it\nmore powerful.\nWhile the Japanese government has been quieter in recent years, they were\nvery active in the early twenty-ﬁrst cen tury. The frequency and strength of BoJ\nintervention during this period created an invisible ﬂoor under USDJPY. Although\nthere has been no more mention of this ﬂoor in recent years, the BoJ/MoF instilled\nenough fear that intervention is always a worry. This fear is well justiﬁed because in\nthe event of BoJ intervention, the average 100-pip daily range can easily triple.\nJapanese intervention can be traded one of two ways—ride the move on the\nday of intervention or fade it in the days that follow. The key is not to be greedy,\nbecause the Japanese government can always step in again. Committing to take a\nsolid 100-pip proﬁt (of a 150–200 pip move) or using a very short-term intraday\ntrailing stop of 15–20 pips, for example, can be helpful.\n■Switzerland\nThe Swiss National Bank’s 1.20 EURCHF ﬂoor is another form of intervention.\nFaced with a high level of uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued\ncurrency, and deﬂation risks in 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange\nrate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At the time, they pledged to sell francs in an unlimited\nquantity to maintain the peg. The goal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping\nthe gain in the franc. As shown in Figure 25.4, the peg was very effective in keeping\nEURCHF above 1.20 between late 2012 an d 2014. However, in January 2015, the\nprospect of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank pushed the SNB to\nabandon their peg, and their surprise announcement caused a 30% one-day decline\nin EURCHF. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\nOther central banks have also intervened in their currency in the past decade\nincluding the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Unfortunately, for the RBNZ, most\nof their efforts failed with the currency rising after each round of intervention.

They have only\nintervened a few times before, the most recent of which was in 2000. The ECB\ncame into the market to buy euros when the single currency dropped from 90 cents\nto 84 cents. In January 1999, when the euro was ﬁrst launched it was valued at\n1.17 against the U.S. dollar. Due to the sharp slide, the European Central Bank\n(ECB) convinced the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada to\njoin them in coordinated intervention to prop up the euro for the ﬁrst time ever.\nThe Eurozone felt concerned that the market was lacking conﬁdence in their new\ncurrency but also feared that the slide in their currency was increasing the cost of the\nregion’s oil imports. With energy prices hitting 10-year highs at the time, Europe’s\nheavy dependence on oil imports necessitated a stronger currency. The U.S. agreed\nto intervention because buying euros and selling dollars would help to boost the\nvalue of European imports and aid in the funding of an already growing U.S. trade\ndeﬁcit. Tokyo joined in the intervention because they were becoming concerned\nthat the weaker euro was posing a threat to their own exports. Although the ECB\ndid not release details on the magnitude of their intervention, the Federal Reserve\nreported having purchased 1.5 billion euros against the dollar on behalf of the ECB.\nEven though the actual intervention itse lf caught the market by surprise, the ECB\ngave good warning to the market with numerous bouts of verbal support from ECB\nand EU ofﬁcials. For trading purposes, this would have given traders an opportunity\nto buy euros in anticipation of intervention or to avoid shorting the EURUSD.\nFigure 25.5 shows the price action of the EURUSD on the day of intervention.\nUnfortunately, there is no minute data available dating back to September 2000,\nbut from the daily chart, we can see that on the day that the ECB intervened in the\neuro (September 22, 2000), with the help of its trade partners, the EURUSD had a\nhigh-low range of over 400 pips.\nEven though intervention does not happen often, it is a very important fundamental\ntrading strategy because each time it occurs, price movements are substantial.\nFor traders, intervention has three major implications for trading:\n1.Bet on intervention : Heed the warnings from central bank ofﬁcials and use it as\na signal for possible intervention—the invisible ﬂoor created by the Japanese\ngovernment gave USDJPY bulls plenty of opportunity to pick short-term\nbottoms.\n2.Avoid betting against intervention : Betting against intervention can be dangerous\nbecause one bout of intervention by a central bank could easily trigger a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: INTERVENTION201EURUSD (September 2000)\n0.91\n0.90\n0.89\n0.88\n0.87\n0.86\n0.85\n0.84\n09/01/2000 09/03/2000 09/05/2000 09/07/2000 09/09/2000 09/11/2000 09/13/2000 09/15/2000 09/17/2000 09/19/2000 09/21/2000 09/23/2000 09/25/2000 09/27/2000 09/29/2000 10/01/2000 10/03/2000\nFIGURE 25.5 EURUSD Intervention\nsharp 100–150 plus pip move in the currency pair, taking out stop orders and\nexacerbating the move.\n3.Use stops when intervention is a risk : With the 24-hour nature of the market,\nintervention can occur at any time of the day.

        "203CHAPTER 26\nCurrency Proﬁles\nand Outlook\nIn order to understand how to trade currencies effectively, it is important to have\na ﬁrm grasp of the general economic characteristics of the most commonly traded\ncurrencies. This includes understanding which economic reports and factors have the\nmost signiﬁcant impact on a currency’s movements. For example, some currencies\nare extremely sensitive to commodity price movements and others are not. Learn-\ning the characteristics or personalities of each currency will help traders understand\nwhat factors inﬂuence the exchange rate on a short- and long-term basis. We will\nlook at the eight most actively traded currencies—the U.S. dollar, euro, British\npound, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian\ndollars. Of course, the most important currency of them all is the U.S. dollar.\n■Currency Proﬁle: U.S. Dollar (USD)\nBroad Economic Overview\nThe United States is the world’s leading economic power, with gross domestic\nproduct valued at over US$17 trillion as of 2014. This is the highest in the world,\nand based on the purchasing power parity model, it is four times the size of Japan’s\noutput, ﬁve times the size of Germany’s, and seven times the size of the United\nKingdom’s. The United States is primarily a service-oriented country, with nearly\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK20480% of its GDP coming from real estate, transportation, ﬁnance, health care, and\nbusiness services. Yet, the sheer size of th e U.S. manufacturing sector still makes\nthe U.S. dollar particularly sensitive to developments in the manufacturing sector.\nWith the United States having the largest and most liquid equity and ﬁxed income\nmarkets in the world, foreign investors have consistently increased their purchases\nof U.S. assets. According to the IMF, fore ign direct investments into the U.S. are\nequal to approximately 40% of total global net inﬂows for the United States. On a\nnet basis, the United States absorbs 71% of total foreign savings. This means that if\nforeign investors are not satisﬁed with th eir returns in the U.S. asset markets and\nthey decide to repatriate their funds, this would have a signiﬁcant effect on U.S.\nasset values and the U.S. dollar. More speciﬁcally, if foreign investors sell their\nU.S. dollar denominated assets holdings in search of higher yielding assets elsewhere,\nthis would typically result in a decline in the value of the U.S. asset, as well as the\nU.S. dollar.\nThe import and export volume of the United States also exceeds that of any other\ncountry. This is due to the country’s sheer size, as true import and export volume\nrepresent a mere 12% of GDP. Despite this large activity, on a netted basis, the\nUnited States is running a very large current account deﬁcit of over $113 billion as\nof Q4 2014. This is a major problem that the U.S. economy has been struggling\nwith for decades, as the large current account deﬁcit makes the U.S. dollar highly\nsensitive to changes in capital ﬂows. In fact, in order to prevent a decline in the U.S.\ndollar as a result of trade, the United States needs to attract a signiﬁcant amount\nof capital inﬂows per day. Thankfully, the U.S. bond market is the largest in the\nworld, and Treasuries remain an attractive investment due to the lack of suitable\nalternatives.\nMost major economies also count the United States as its largest trading partner,\nwith U.S. trade representing 20% of tota l world trade. These rankings are very\nimportant because changes in the value of the dollar and its volatility will impact the\nU.S. trading activities with these respective countries. More speciﬁcally, a weaker\ndollar will encourage more U.S. exports, whereas a stronger dollar could curb\nforeign demand for American goods. However, since the United States is not a\ntrade-dependent economy, the strength of a dollar is less troublesome. Here’s a\nbreakdown of the most important trading partners for the United States, in order of\nimportance:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Canada\n2. Mexico\n3. China\n4. European Union\n5. Japan\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK205Leading Import Sources\n1. China\n2. Canada\n3. Mexico\n4. European Union\n5. Japan\nSource: US Trade.gov 2014\nMonetary and Fiscal Policy Makers—The Federal Reserve\nThe Federal Reserve Board (Fed) is the monetary policy authority of the United\nStates. The Fed is responsible for setting and implementing monetary policy. The\nboard consists of a 12-member Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The\nvoting members of the FOMC are the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board,\nplus ﬁve presidents of the 12 district reserve banks. The FOMC holds eight meetings\nper year, which are widely watched for interest rate announcements or changes in\ngrowth expectations. After four of those meetings, the head of the Central Bank\nholds a press conference, and typically that is when major monetary policy changes\nare made.\nThe Fed has a high degree of independence to set monetary authority. They are\nless subject to political inﬂuences, as most members are accorded long terms that\nallow them to remain in ofﬁce through periods of alternate party dominance in both\nthe presidency and Congress.\nThe Federal Reserve issues a biannual Monetary Policy Report in February and\nJuly followed by the Humphrey–Hawkins testimony where the Federal Reserve\nchairman responds to questions from both the Congress and the Banking Committees\nin regards to this report. This report is important to watch, as it contains the FOMC\nforecasts for GDP growth, inﬂation, and unemployment.\nThe Fed, unlike most other central banks, has a mandate or ‘‘long-run objectives’’\nof ‘‘price stability and sustainable economic growth.’’ In order to adhere to these\ngoals, the Fed has to use monetary policy to limit inﬂation and unemployment\nand achieve balanced growth. The most popular tools that the Fed uses to control\nmonetary policy include the following.\nOpen Market Operations\nOpen market operations involve Fed purchases of government securities, including\nTreasury bills, notes and bonds. This is one of the most popular methods for\nthe Fed to signal and implement policy changes. Generally speaking, increases in\nFed purchases of government securities decreases interest rates, while selling of\ngovernment securities by the Fed boosts interest rates.\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK206Fed Funds Target\nThe Fed Funds target rate is the key policy target of the Federal Reserve. It is\nthe interest rate for borrowing that the Fed offers to its member banks. The Fed\ntends to increase this rate to curb inﬂation or decrease this rate to promote growth\nand consumption. Changes to this rate are closely watched by the market and tend\nto imply major changes in policy and will typically have large ramiﬁcations for\nglobal ﬁxed income and equity markets. The market also pays particular attention\nto the statement released by the Federal Reserve as it can offer guidance for future\nmonetary policy actions.\nFiscal policy is in the hands of the U.S. Treasury. Fiscal policy decisions include\ndetermining the appropriate level of taxes and government spending. In fact,\nalthough the markets pay more attention to the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury\nis the actual government body that determines dollar policy. That is, if they feel\nthat the USD rate on the foreign exchange market is under- or overvalued, the\nU.S. Treasury is the government body that gives the NY Federal Reserve Board the\nauthority and instructions to intervene in the foreign exchange market by physically\nselling or buying USD. Therefore, the Treasury’s view on dollar policy and changes\nto that view can be important to the currency market.\nOver the past few decades, the Treasury and Fed ofﬁcials have maintained a\n‘‘strong dollar’’ bias. While a weak dollar helps to promote growth for political\nreasons, the government is unlikely to change their stance in support of a weak\ndollar policy.\nImportant Characteristics of the U.S. Dollar\n■Over 80% of all currency deals involve the dollar . The most liquid currencies in the\nforeign exchange market are the EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, and USDCHF.\nThese currencies represent the most commonly traded currencies in the world,\nand it is no coincidence that all of these currency pairs involve the U.S. dollar. In\nfact, 80% of all currency deals, which include currency conversion, hedging, and\ntrade settlement, involve the U.S. dolla r. This explains why U.S. data, the U.S.\ndollar, and U.S. fundamentals are so important to foreign exchange traders.\n■Prior to the introduction of the euro and the g rowing utilization of t he Chinese renminbi,\nthe U.S. dollar was considered one the world’s p remier ‘‘safe-haven’’ reserve currencies .T h e\nU.S. dollar has long been one of the world’s premier ‘‘safe-haven’’ currencies, with\n76% of global currency reserves held in dollars. To this day, the dollar is still the\npreferred currency of choice, but in recent years its safe haven, reserve currency\nstatus has been challenged by the euro and Chinese renminbi. We are still a very\nlong way from the dollar being usurped by either currency, but in the past decade,\nmany central banks have slowly diversiﬁed their reserves by reducing their dollar\nholdings and increasing their euro and renminbi holdings. This trend will only\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK207accelerate in the years to come, but until European and Chinese bond markets are\nlarge and developed enough to handle the reserve diversiﬁcation ﬂows, the dollar\nand U.S. Treasuries will still be the inv estment of choice for reserve managers.\n■The U.S. dollar moves in the opposite direction of gold prices . One of the unique\ncharacteristics of the U.S. dollar is that there is a strong inverse relationship\nbetween the price of gold and the value of the U.S. dollar as shown in Figure 26.1.\nThese two instruments are near-perfect mirror images of each other, which means\nthat when the value of the dollar declines, the price of gold rises; and when the\ndollar appreciates, the price of gold falls. There is, of course, a good reason—gold\nis priced in U.S. dollars. The correlation is not perfect—in times of geopolitical\nuncertainty, investors generally prefer hard versus ﬁat currencies or gold versus\nthe dollar.\n■Many emerging market countries ‘‘peg’ ’ their local currencies to the dollar . Pegging a\ncurrency to the dollar refers to the idea that a government agrees to maintain their\ncurrency at a speciﬁc rate or range to the U .S. dollar. As the value of the dollar\nchanges, this requires the central bank to buy or sell their local currency and\nthe U.S. dollar to maintain the peg. For example, let’s imagine that Country A\npledges to maintain a ﬁxed currency peg of 7.5 versus the U.S. dollar. If the dollar\nweakens, causing downward pressure on the exchange rate, the central bank\nwould have to buy U.S. dollars and sell their local currency to maintain the peg.\nAfter buying dollars, they would typically invest those funds into U.S. Treasuries.\nDollar Index vs. Gold\n2000\n1900\n1800\n1700\n1600\n1500\n1400\n1300\n1200\n1100\n1000\n2/19/10 2/19/11 2/19/12\nGold Dollar2/19/13 2/19/14 2/19/15105\n100\n95\n90\n85\n80\n75\n70\nFIGURE 26.1 Dollar Index vs. Gold\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK208This process is exactly how China and other Asian economies became large\nholders of US Treasuries. Through the years, many countries have switched from\na ﬁxed to ﬂoating rate peg and in some cases a peg that references a basket of\ncurrencies, but in each case, the dollar is still the leading component. However,\nthe movement from ﬁxed U.S. dollar pegs to a basket reduces the amount of\ndollars that a country like China needs to buy, and as their currency regime and\nothers in the region are loosened further, the impact on the dollar will grow.\n■Interest rate differentials between U.S. Tr easuries and foreign bonds strongly followed .T h e\ninterest rate differenti als between U.S. Treasuries and foreign bonds are a very\nimportant relationship that professional FX traders need to follow. It can be a\nstrong indicator of potential currency movements because the U.S. market is one\nof the largest markets in the world, and investors are very sensitive to the yields\nthat the offered by U.S. assets. Large investors are constantly looking for assets\nwith the highest yields. As yields in the U.S. decrease or if yields abroad increase,\nthis would induce investors to sell their U.S. assets and purchase foreign assets.\nSelling U.S. ﬁxed income or equity assets would inﬂuence the currency market\nbecause that would require selling U.S. dollars and buying the foreign currency.\nIf U.S. yields rise or foreign yields decrease, investors in general would be more\ninclined to purchase U.S. assets, therefore boosting the value of the dollar (USD).\n■Keep an eye on the dollar index . Market participants closely follow the U.S. dollar\nindex as a gauge of overall dollar strength or weakness. The USD index is a\nfutures contract traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) that is calculated\nusing the trade-weighted geometric average of six currencies. It is important to\nfollow this index because when market participants are reporting general dollar\nweakness or a decline in the trade-weighted dollar, they are typically referring to\nthis index. Unfortunately, the weighting does not accurately reﬂect U.S. trade\nactivity. Nonetheless, the DXY is closely followed and actively traded. Also,\neven though the dollar may have moved signiﬁcantly against a single currency, it\nmay have not moved as signiﬁcantly on a trade-weighted basis. This is important\nbecause some central bankers may choose to focus on the trade-weighted index\ninstead of the individual currency pair’s performance against the dollar.\n■The dollar is impacted by equities and Treasuries . In earlier chapters, we have\nestablished that there is a strong corre lation between a country’s equity and\nﬁxed-income markets and its currency: If the equity market is rising, generally\nspeaking, foreign investment dollars should be coming in to seize the opportunity.\nIf equity markets are falling, domestic investors will be selling their shares of local\ncompanies and looking for opportunities abroad. With ﬁxed-income markets,\neconomies boasting the most valuable ﬁxed income opportunities with the highest\nyields will be capable of attracting more foreign investment. Daily ﬂuctuations\nand developments in any of these markets reﬂect movement of foreign portfolio\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK209investments, which would require foreign exchange transactions. Cross border\nmerger and acquisition activities can also inﬂuence the price action of currencies.\nLarge M&A deals, particularly those that involve a signiﬁcant cash portion, will\nhave a notable impact on the currency markets. The reason is that the acquirer\nwill need to buy or sell dollars to fund their cross-border acquisition.\nImportant Economic Indicators for the United States\nEconomic data is always important, but U.S. data tends to have the greatest impact\non currencies because more than 80% of currency transactions involve the U.S.\ndollar. Here are some of the most important and market moving pieces of U.S. data:\nEmployment: Nonfarm Payrolls\nThe employment report is the most important and widely watched indicator on the\neconomic calendar. Its importance is mostly due to political inﬂuences rather than\npure economic reasons, as the Fed is under strict pressure to keep unemployment\nunder control. As a result, interest rate policy is directly inﬂuenced by employment\nconditions. The monthly jobs report consists of data compiled from two different\nsurveys: the establishment survey and the household survey. The establishment\nsurvey provides data on nonf arm payroll employment, a verage hourly workweek,\nand the aggregate hours index. The household survey provides information on the\nlabor force, household employment, and the unemployment rate. When this report\nis released on the ﬁrst Friday of every month, forex traders will immediately hone\nin on the nonfarm payrolls number, the unemployment rate, and average hourly\nearnings. However, any revisions or seasonal adjustments can also impact the dollar’s\nreaction to the overall report.\nConsumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index is a key gauge of inﬂation. The index measures the prices\non a ﬁxed basket of consumer goods. Economists tend to focus more on the CPI-U\nor the core inﬂation rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy components.\nThe indicator is widely watched by the F X markets as it drives a lot of activity\nbecause job growth and inﬂation is the key to monetary policy.\nRetail Sales\nThe key to growth is consumer spending and for this reason, the retail sales report\nis also extremely market moving. The Retail Sales Index measures the total goods\nsold by a sampling of retail stores over the course of a month. This index is used as\na gauge of consumer consumption and consumer conﬁdence. The most important\nnumber to watch is retail sales less autos, as auto sales can vary month-to-month.\nWhile retail sales can be quite volatile due to seasonality, it is one of the most\nimportant indicators on the health of the economy along with a key input for GDP.\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK210Nonmanufacturing and Manufacturing ISM\nThe monthly nonmanufacturing and manufacturing reports released by the Institute\nfor Supply Management is also important because it generally provides the most\ncurrent information on activity in the economy. ISM releases a monthly composite\nindex based on surveys of 300 purchasing managers nationwide representing 20\ndifferent industries. An index value above 50 reﬂects expansion, while values below\n50 are indicative of contraction. The ISM nonmanufacturing index is particularly\nimportant because the United States is a services economy, and typically this report\nis released ahead of nonfarm payrolls; and the employment subcomponent can\nprovide early clues on the health of the labor market.\nConsumer Conﬁdence\nThe Consumer Conﬁdence Survey measures how individuals feel about the economy.\nThere are two popular reports—one released by the Conference Board and one\nby the University of Michigan. In the Conference Board survey, questionnaires\nare sent out to a nationwide representative sample of 5,000 households, of which\napproximately 3,500 respond. Households are asked ﬁve questions:\n1. A rating of business conditions in the household’s area\n2. A rating of business conditions in six months\n3. Job availability in the area\n4. Job availability in six months\n5. Family income in six months\nResponses are seasonally adjusted and an index is constructed for each response,\nand then a composite index is fashioned based on the aggregate responses. The\nUniversity of Michigan Survey, on the other hand, only polls 500 people, but since\nit is released before the Conference Board’s report, it can have a larger impact\non currencies. Rising c onsumer conﬁdence is viewed as a precursor to stronger\nconsumer spending and growth.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes in\nselling prices received by domestic producers for their output. PPI tracks changes\nin prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy, includ-\ning agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing, and\nmining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished goods\nPPI and how the index has reacted on a monthly, quarterly, and annualized basis.\nGross Domestic Product\nGross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure of the total production and\nconsumption of goods and services. In the United States, the Bureau of Economic\nCURRENCY PROFILES AND OUTLOOK211Analysis (BEA) constructs two complementary measures of GDP, one based on\nincome and one based on expenditures. The advance release of GDP, which occurs\nthe month after each quarter ends, contains some BEA estimates for data not yet\nreleased, inventories and trade balance, and is the most important release. Other\nreleases of GDP, which are the revisions, are typically not very signiﬁcant unless a\nmajor change is made.\nInternational Trade\nThe balance of trade represents the di fference between exports and imports of\nforeign trade in goods and services. Merchandise data are provided for U.S. total\nforeign trade with all countries and details for trade with speciﬁc countries and\nregions of the world, as well as for individual commodities. Traders tend to focus\non seasonally adjusted trade numbers over a three-month period as single month\ntrade periods are regarded as volatile and less reliable.\nEmployment Cost Index (ECI)\nThe employment cost index data is based on a survey of employer payrolls in the\nthird month of the quarter for the pay period ending on the twelfth day of the\nmonth. This survey is a probability sample of approximately 3,600 private industry\nemployers and 700 state and local governments, public schools, and public hospitals.\nThe big advantage of ECI is that it includes nonwage costs, which adds as much\nas 30% to total labor costs. Reaction to the ECI, however, is often muted as it\nis generally very stable. It should be noted however that it is one of the Federal\nReserve’s favorite indicators.\nIndustrial Production\nThe Index of Industrial Production is a set of indexes that measures the monthly\nphysical output of U.S. factories, mines, and utilities. The index is broken down\nby industry type and market type. Foreign exchange markets focus mostly on the\nseasonally adjusted monthly change in aggregate ﬁgure. Increases in the index are\ntypically dollar positive.\nTreasury International Capital Flow Data (TIC Data)\nThe Treasury International Capital ﬂow data measures the amount of capital ﬂow\ninto the United States on a monthly basis. This economic release has become\nincreasingly important over the past few years since the funding of the U.S. deﬁcit\nis becoming more of an issue. Aside from the headline number itself, the market\nalso pays close attention to the ofﬁcial ﬂows, which represents the demand for U.S.\ngovernment debt by foreign central banks."

        "213CHAPTER 27\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nEuro (EUR)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe European Union (EU) was developed as an institutional framework for the\nconstruction of a united Europe. As of May 2015, the EU consists of 28 member\ncountries with 19 of these nations sharing the euro as a common currency. The\nEurozone consists of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,\nGreece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,\nPortugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. With the exception of Denmark and the\nUnited Kingdom, other EU states are obliged to join the monetary union when they\nmeet the criteria to do so. Aside from a common currency, these countries also\nshare a single monetary policy dictated by the European Central Bank (ECB). These\ncommon currency countries constitute the European Monetary Union (EMU).\nThe EMU is the world’s second largest economic power, with gross domestic\nproduct valued at approximately US$18 trillion in 2014. With a highly developed\nﬁxed income, equity, and futures market, the EMU is the second most attractive\ninvestment market for domestic and international investors. In its early days, the\nEMU found difﬁculty attracting foreign direct investment or large capital ﬂows\nbecause, historically, the U.S. markets are larger with more consistent returns. As\na result, the U.S. absorbs 71% of total foreign savings. However, with the euro\nbecoming an established currency and the European Monetary Union incorporating\nmore members, the euro’s importance as a reserve currency is rising and translating\ninto greater capital ﬂows. The only problem is that European bond markets are\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)214fragmented, and there are not enough quality assets for central banks to invest in.\nUnless there are euro bonds, foreign central banks could be slow to diversify their\nreserve holdings. Nonetheless, they will do so gradually, providing ongoing support\nfor the euro.\nTrade is extremely important to Eurozone nations and most countries conduct\nthe majority of their trade with other states in the region. This is important because\none of the most valuable aspects of the euro is its facilitation of trade activity through\nthe elimination of exchange rate risk. Large Eurozone nations such as Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Spain also conduct signiﬁcant trade activity with countries like the\nUnited States and China. This makes the value of the euro particularly important\nto economic activity. A country like the United States is less sensitive to exchange\nrate ﬂuctuations because most of its demand is internal, but Europe is extremely\nsensitive to its exchange rate because many Eurozone nations rely on external\ndemand. The size and scope of the EMU’s trade with the rest of the world provides\nit with signiﬁcant power in the international trade arena. International clout is also\none of the primary goals in the formation of the European Union, because it allows\nindividual nations to negotiate as a group on an equal playing ﬁeld with the United\nStates and China, their two largest trading partners. The breakdowns of the most\nimportant trading partners for the European Union are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Switzerland\n4. Russia\n5. Turkey\nLeading Import Sources\n1. China\n2. Russia\n3. United States\n4. Norway\n5. Switzerland\nWhile trade is extremely important, the service sector has the largest share of\ntotal output followed by manufacturing. In fact, a large number of the companies\nwhose primary purpose is to produce ﬁnished products still concentrate their EU\nactivity on innovation, research, design, and marketing, while outsourcing most of\ntheir manufacturing activities to Asia.\nThe EU’s growing role in international trade has major implications for the role of\nthe euro as a reserve currency. As more countries conduct trade with the Eurozone,\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)215they will be motivated to accumulate more euros to reduce exchange risk and\ntransaction costs. Traditionally, most international trade transactions involve the\nBritish pound, the Japanese yen, and/or the U.S. dollar. Before the establishment of\nthe euro, it was unreasonable to hold large amounts of every individual EU national\ncurrency. As a result, currency reserves tended toward the dollar. At the end of the\n1990s, approximately 65% of all world reserves were held in U.S. dollars, but after\nthe introduction of the euro, foreign reserve assets slowly shifted towards the euro.\nThis trend will only continue as the world becomes more globalized.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nMakers—The European Central Bank\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is the governing body responsible for determining\nthe monetary policy of the countries participating in the EMU. The Executive Board\nof the EMU consists of the president of the ECB, the vice president of the ECB, and\nfour other members. These individuals, along with the governors of the national\ncentral banks, comprise the Governing Council. The ECB is set up such that the\nExecutive Board implements the policies dictated by the Governing Council. New\nmonetary policies decisions are typically made by majority vote, with the president\nhaving the casting vote in the event of a tie in their monthly meeting. After each\nmeeting the Central Bank president holds a press conference to answer questions.\nThis is also used as an opportunity to clarify their monetary policy stance.\nThe EMU’s primary objective is to maintain price stability and promote growth.\nMonetary and ﬁscal policy changes are made to ensure that this objective is met. With\nthe formation of the EMU, the Maastric ht Treaty was developed by the Union to\napply a number of criteria for each member country. These criteria were developed\nby the Union to help them achieve their objective. Deviations from these criteria\nby any one country will result in heavy ﬁnes. Listed below are the EMU criteria.\nIt is apparent based on these criteria that the ECB has a strict mandate focused on\ninﬂation and deﬁcit. Generally, the ECB strives to maintain annual growth in HCPI\n(Harmonized Consumer Price Index) below 2% and M3 (Money Supply) annual\ngrowth around 4.5%.\nThe EMU Criteria\nIn the 1992 Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) the following\npreconditions were created for any EU member state looking to join the economic\nand monetary union (EMU).\n■A rate of inﬂation no more than 1.5% above the average of the three best\nperforming member states, taking the average of the 12-month year-on-year rate\npreceding the assessment date.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)216■Long-term interest rates not exceeding the average rates of these low-inﬂation\nstates by more than 2% for the preceding 12 months.\n■Exchange rates which ﬂuctuate within the normal margins of the exchange-rate\nmechanism (ERM) for at least two years.\n■A general government debt/GDP ratio of not more than 60%, although a higher\nratio may be permissible if it is ‘‘sufﬁciently diminishing.’’\n■A general government deﬁcit not exceeding 3% of GDP, although a small and\ntemporary excess can be permitted.\nIf a country meets the convergence criteria and joins the EMU, their monetary\npolicy will be determined by the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB and the\nESCB (European System of Central Banks) are independent institutions from both\nnational governments and other EU institutions, granting them complete control\nover monetary policy. This operational independence is accorded to them as per\nArticle 108 of the Maastricht Treaty, which states that any member of the decision-\nmaking bodies cannot seek or take instructions from any Community Institutions,\nany government of a member state, or any other body. In other words, no one\ncountry can pressure the ECB into making a monetary policy change that is in only\ntheir best interest. The primary tools the ECB uses to control monetary policy is the\nfollowing.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe ECB has four main categories of open market operations to steer interest rates,\nmanage liquidity, and signal monetary policy stance. This includes:\n■Main reﬁnancing operations . These are regular liquidity-providing reverse transac-\ntions conducted weekly with a maturity o f two weeks, which provide the bulk of\nreﬁnancing to the ﬁnancial sector.\n■Longer-term reﬁnancing operations . These are liquidity-providing reverse transactions\nwith a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months, which provide\ncounterparties with additional longer-term reﬁnancing.\n■Fine-tuning operations . These are executed on an ad-hoc basis, with the aim of\nboth managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates, in\nparticular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected\nliquidity ﬂuctuations.\n■Structural operations . These involve the issuance of debt certiﬁcates, reverse trans-\nactions, and outright transactions. These operations will be executed whenever\nthe ECB wishes to adjust th e structural position of the Eurosystem vis-` a-vis the\nﬁnancial sector (on a regular or nonregular basis).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)217ECB Minimum Bid Rate (Repo Rate)\nThe ECB minimum bid rate is the key policy target for the ECB and the level of\nborrowing that the ECB offers to the central banks of its member states. This is also\nthe rate that is subject to change at the monthly ECB meetings. Since inﬂation is a\nmajor concern for European policy makers, they are generally more inclined to keep\ninterest rates at lofty levels to prevent inﬂation. Changes in the ECB’s minimum bid\nrate can have large ramiﬁcations for the EUR.\nThe ECB does not have an exchange rate target, but will factor in exchange rates\nin their policy deliberations because they can affect price stability. A high exchange\nrate lowers inﬂationary pressures while a low exchange rate promotes it. The ECB is\nnot prohibited from intervening in the foreign exchange markets if they believe that\ninﬂation is a concern. As a result, comments by members of the Governing Council\nare closely watched by forex traders and can have a signiﬁcant impact on the euro.\nIn addition to their monthly meetings, the Central Bank will also publish a\nmonthly bulletin and release staff forecasts and minutes from past meetings. The\npresident of the Central Bank holds a press conference after the policy meeting and\nthat, along with each of these event risk s, can cause volatility in the currency.\nNow let’s take a look at some of the important characteristics of the euro:\n■EURUSD cross is the most liquid and actively traded currency . The euro was introduced\nas an electronic currency in January 1999. At the time, the euro replaced all\npre-EMU currencies, except for Greece’s currency, which was converted to the\neuro in January 2001. As a result, the EURUSD cross is now the most liquid\ncurrency in the world and its movements are used as the primary gauge of the\nhealth of both the European and U.S. economies. Figure 27.1 highlights the\n10 year performance of EUR-USD. The euro is most frequently known as the\n‘‘anti-dollar’’ since dollar or U.S. fundamentals generally have a greater impact\non the movement of the currency.\nEURJPY and EURCHF are also very liquid currencies that can be used as a\ngauge of the health of the Japanese and Swiss economies. Many new traders will\nstart with the EURUSD because of its orderly movements, tight spread, and\nliquidity.\n■Euro: A currency without a country . One of the greatest problems of the euro is that it\nis currency without a country. Instead, it bears the economic, political, and social\nrisks of 19 different nations. This is its gr eatest strength and its greatest weakness.\nIn the past decade, we have seen how the debt crisis in smaller Eurozone nations\nhave affected the currency as a whole. It undermines conﬁdence and has, on many\noccasions, put the entire monetary union at risk.\n■Spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and 10-year Bunds can indicate euro sentiment .\nTen-year government bonds can serve as an important indicator of where the euro\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)218\nFIGURE 27.1 EURUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)219is headed, especially against the U.S. dollar. The differential between the 10-year\nU.S. government bond and the 10-year German Bund rates can provide a good\nindication for EURUSD’s movement. If Bund rates are higher than U.S. Treasury\nrates and the differential increases, or the spread widens, this is generally positive\nfor the EURUSD. Alternatively, a decrease in the differential or a tightening of\nthe interest rates is generally bearish for EURUSD. As there is no Euro bond,\nthe 10-year German Bund yield is typically used as the benchmark bond for the\nEurozone because Germany is the largest country in the monetary union.\n■Predictions for euro area money ﬂows . Another useful rate to follow is the three-month\ninterest rate, also known as the euro interbank offer rate or the Euribor rate. This\nis the rate offered from one large bank to another on interbank term deposits.\nTraders tend to compare the Euribor futures rate with the Eurodollar futures rate.\nEurodollars are deposits denominated in U.S. dollars at banks and other ﬁnancial\ninstitutions outside the United States. Because investors like high-yielding assets,\nEuropean ﬁxed-income assets become more attractive as the spread between\nEuribor futures and Eurodollar futures widens in favor of Euribors. As the spread\nnarrows, European assets become less attractive, whereby implying a potential\ndecrease in money ﬂows into the Euro.\nMergers and acquisition activity can also affect how the EURUSD moves.\nIn recent years we have seen increased M&A activity between EU and U.S.\nmultinationals. Large deals, especially with a large cash component, can lead to a\nsudden burst in the EURUSD, but the reaction is generally short-lived.\n■Important Indicators for the Euro\nWhen it comes to Eurozone economic reports, the only ones that affect the euro are\nGerman or Eurozone data. The largest countries in the Eurozone in order of GDP\ncontribution are Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. While French and Italian data\nare important, they rarely move the currency. So what forex traders should focus on\nare the broader regional reports and German data. Central bank rate decisions are\nthe most important, but here are some additional economic reports that can have\nmeaningful impact on the currency.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the Manufacturing\nand Service sectors. For the Eurozone, they provide this data for the four largest\neconomies and a composite index for the region. These numbers are extremely\nmarket moving because they provide the most up-to-date information on how each\nof the economies are performing in the current month and not how the economies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)220performed the previous month like many other reports. However, since the reports\nare for the current period, they are usually subject to revisions so the euro will\nmove on the preliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents\nexpansion, and a reading below 50 represents contraction. For the Eurozone, the\nmanufacturing PMI index is the most important along with the composite index,\nwhich aggregates how the manufacturing and service sector are performing. Since\nthe German data are released shortly before the Eurozone report, they can have a\ngreater impact on the currency.\nIFO Survey\nGermany is by far the largest economy in Europe and is responsible for approximately\n20% of total GDP. Any insight into German business conditions is seen as an insight\ninto Europe as a whole. The IFO is a monthly survey conducted by the IFO institute.\nThey survey over 7,000 German businesses, asking for their assessment of the\nGerman business climate and their short-term plans. The initial publication of the\nresults consists of the business climate headline ﬁgure and its two equally weighted\nsubindices: current business conditions and business expectations. The typical range\nis from 80 to 120, with a higher number indicating greater business conﬁdence. The\nreport is most valuable, however, when measured against previous data.\nInﬂation Indicators—HICP\nSince the ECB has an inﬂation mandate, the EU Harmonized Index of Consumer\nPrices (HICP) published by Eurostat is very important. This harmonized index is\ndesigned for international comparison as required by EU law. The index is compiled\nwith information on prices retrieved by each national statistical agency. Individual\ncountries are required to provide Eurostat with the 100 indices used to compute the\nHICP. The national HICPs are totaled by Eurostat as a weighted average of these\nsubindices, and the weights used are country-speciﬁc. The HICP is released at the\nend of the month following the reference period, which is about 10 days after the\npublications of the national CPIs from Spain and France, the ﬁnal EMU-5 countries\nto release their CPIs. Even if part of the information is already known when the\nHICP is released, it is an important release because it serves as the reference inﬂation\nindex for the ECB who aims to keep Eurozone consumer price inﬂation between\n0% and 2%.\nGerman Industrial Production\nIndustrial production data are seasonally adjusted (SA) and include a breakdown into\nfour major subcategories: mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction. The\nmanufacturing aggregate comprises four main product groups: basic and producer\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)221goods, capital goods, consumer durables, and consumer nondurables. The market\ntends to pay attention to the annual rate of change and the seasonally adjusted\nmonth-on-month ﬁgure. Germany’s ﬁgure is most important since it is the largest\ncountry in the Eurozone; however, the market can also react to the French industrial\nproduction report. The initial industrial production release is based on a narrower\ndata sample and hence subject to revision when the full sample has become available.\nThe ministry occasionally provides insight on the expected direction of the revision\nin the initial data release.\nGerman Unemployment\nLabor market numbers are important for every country and in the case of the\nEurozone, German unemployment is the most important. Released by the Labor\nOfﬁce, the data contain information on the number of unemployed, as well as\nthe changes on the previous month, on both seasonally (SA) and nonseasonally\n(NSA) adjusted terms. The NSA unemployment rate is provided, along with data\non vacancies, short-shift working arrangements, and the number of employees\n(temporarily suspended in 1999). Within an hour after the FLO release, the\nBundesbank releases the SA unemployment rate. The day ahead of the release,\nthere is often a leak of the ofﬁcial data from a trade-union source. The leak is\nusually of the NSA level of unemployment in millions. When a precise ﬁgure is\nreported on Reuters, as given by ‘‘sources’’ for the NSA level of unemployment,\nthe leak usually reﬂects t he ofﬁcial ﬁgures. Rumors often circulate up to one week\nbefore the ofﬁcial release, and they are notoriously imprecise. Regardless, a drop\nin unemployment along with an improvement in the jobless rate is positive for the\ncurrency, whereas a rise in jobless claims or increase in the unemployment rate is\nnegative for the currency.\nPreliminary GDP\nPreliminary GDP is issued when Eurostat has collected data from a sufﬁcient number\nof countries to produce an estimate. This usually includes France, Germany, and\nthe Netherlands. However, Italy is not included in the preliminary release and is\nonly added in the ﬁnal number. The yearly aggregates for EU-15 and EMU-11\nare a simple sum of national GDP. For the quarterly accounts, the aggregation is\nmore complex since some countries (Greece, Ireland, and Luxembourg) do not\nyet produce quarterly national accounts data. Moreover, Portugal produces only\npartial quarterly accounts with a signiﬁcant lag. Thus, both the EU-15 and EMU-11\nquarterly paths are the result of estimates from quarterly data based on a group of\ncountries accounting for more than 95% of total EU GDP (see the Foreword for a\ndetailed description of the weights of each country in the EU).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)222M3\nM3 is a broad measure of money supply, which includes everything from notes\nand coins to bank deposits. The ECB closely monitors M3 as they view it as a key\nmeasure of inﬂation. At its session in December 1998, the governing council of the\nECB set its ﬁrst reference value for M3 growth at 4.5%. This value supports inﬂation\nb e l o w2 % ,t r e n dg r o w t ho f2 %t o2 . 5 % ,a n dal o n g - t e r md e c l i n ei nt h ev e l o c i t y\nof money by 0.5% to 1%. The growth rate is monitored on a three-month moving\naverage basis in order to prevent monthly volatility to distort the information given\nby the aggregate. The ECB’s approach to monetary targeting leaves considerable\nroom for maneuver and interpretation. Because the ECB does not impose bands\non M3 growth, as the Bundesbank used to do, there will be no automatic action\nwhen M3 growth diverges from the reference value. Moreover, although the ECB\nconsiders M3 to be the key indicator, it will also take into account the changes in\nother monetary aggregates.\nIndividual Country Budget Deﬁcits\nThe Stability and Growth Pact states that budget deﬁcits for every country in the\nmonetary union must be kept below 3% of GDP. Failure to meet these targets will\nbe punished. However through the years many Eurozone nations have had deﬁcits\nin excess of 3% and penalties have not been enforced.\n223CHAPTER 28\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nBritish Pound (GBP)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe United Kingdom is the world’s ﬁfth largest economy with GDP valued at\napproximately US$3 trillion in 2014 according to the IMF. With one of the most\ndynamic central banks in the world, the UK economy beneﬁted from many years of\nstrong growth, low unemployment, expa nding output, and resilient consumption.\nThe strength of consumer consumption has been largely due to the strong housing\nmarket. The United Kingdom is a service-oriented economy, with manufacturing\nrepresenting an increasingly smaller portion of GDP, now equivalent to only one-\nﬁfth of national output. Their capital market system is one of the most developed\nin the world, with ﬁnance and banking being the strongest contributors to GDP.\nAlthough the majority of the UK’s GDP is from services, it is also one of the\nlargest producers and exporters of natural gas in the European Union. The energy\nproduction industry accounts for 10% of GDP, which is one of the highest shares of\nany industrialized nation. This is particularly important, as increases in energy prices\n(such as oil) will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt the large number of UK oil exporters. (The\nUnited Kingdom became a net oil importer for a brief period due to disruptions in\nthe North Sea in 2003, but it has already resumed its status as a net oil exporter.)\nOverall, the United Kingdom is a net importer of goods with a consistent\ntrade deﬁcit. Its largest trading partner is the EU, with trade between the two\nconstituencies accounting for over 50% of all of the country’s import and export\nactivities. The United States, on an individual basis, still remains the United\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)224Kingdom’s largest trading partner. The breakdowns of the most important trading\npartners for the United Kingdom are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. Germany\n3. Switzerland\n4. Netherlands\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Netherlands\n3. China\n4. United States\n5. France\nSince the launch of the euro in 1999, the single currency’s troubles have become\nincreasingly apparent, and this has made the UK’s decision to maintain its own\ncurrency and monetary authority increasingly intelligent. Yet the possibility of euro\nadoption will remain a question in the minds of pound traders for many years\nto come, although in 2015 into 2016, the more relevant question is whether the\nUnited Kingdom will remain in the EMU. A decision on euro entry has signiﬁcant\nramiﬁcations for the UK economy—the most important of which is that UK interest\nrates would have to be adjusted to reﬂect the equivalent interest rate of the Eurozone.\nOne of the primary arguments against adopting the euro is that the UK government\nhas sound macroeconomic policies that have worked very well for the country for\ndecades. Its successful monetary and ﬁscal policies have led it to outperform most\nmajor economies during economic downturns, including the European Union.\nThe UK Treasury has previously speciﬁed ﬁve economic tests that must be met\nprior to euro entry, which are the following:\nUK’s Five Economic Tests for Euro\n1. Is there sustainable convergence in business cycles and economic structures\nbetween the United Kingdom and other EMU members, so that the UK citizens\ncould live comfortably with euro interest rates on a permanent basis?\n2. Is there enough ﬂexibility to cope with economic change?\n3. Would joining the EMU create an environment that would encourage ﬁrms to\ninvest in the United Kingdom?\n4. Would joining the EMU have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the\nUK’s ﬁnancial services industry?\n5. Would joining the EMU be good for promoting stability and growth in\nemployment?\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)225The United Kingdom is a very political country where government ofﬁcials are\nhighly concerned with voter approval. If voters do not support euro entry, the\nlikelihood of EMU entry would decline. The following are some of the arguments\nfor and against adopting the euro:\nArguments in Favor of Adopting the Euro\n■There would be reduced exchange rate uncertainty for UK businesses and lower\nexchange rate transa ction costs or risks.\n■The prospect of sustained low inﬂation under the governance of the European\nCentral Bank should reduce long-term interest rates and stimulate sustained\neconomic growth.\n■Single currency promotes price transparency.\n■The integration of national ﬁnancial markets of the EU will lead to higher efﬁciency\nin the allocation of capital in Europe.\n■The euro is the second most important reserve currency after the USD.\n■With the United Kingdom joining the euro, the political clout of the EMU would\nincrease dramatically.\nArguments against Adopting the Euro\n■Currency unions have collapsed in the past.\n■Economic or political instabilities of one country would impact the Euro, which\nwould have exchange rate ramiﬁcations for otherwise healthy countries.\n■Strict EMU criteria outlined by the Stability and Growth Pact.\n■Entry would mean a permanent transfer of domestic monetary authority to the\nEuropean Central Bank.\n■Joining a currency union with no monetary ﬂexibility would require the United\nKingdom to have more ﬂexibility in the labor and housing markets.\n■There are fears about which countries might dominate the ECB.\n■Adjusting to new currency will require large transaction costs.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Bank\nof England\nFor the United Kingdom, the Bank of England (BoE) controls monetary policy, and\nthe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is a nine-member committee responsible\nfor setting interest rate policy in the United Kingdom. It consists of a governor,\ntwo deputy governors, two executive directors of the central bank, and four outside\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)226experts. The committee was granted operational independence in 1997, which\nmeans they won’t be inﬂuenced by the governing party. Despite this independence,\nmonetary policies have centered on achieving an inﬂation target dictated by the\nChancellor of the Treasury. Currently, this target is RPIX (Retail Price Index)\ninﬂation of 2.5%. The central bank has the power to change interest rates to levels\nthat will allow them to meet this target. The MPC holds monthly meetings, which\nare closely followed for announcements on changes in monetary policy, including\nchanges in the interest rate (bank repo rate). When no changes are made, no details\nare provided. In this case, the rate decision is generally a nonevent for the currency,\nwith traders shifting their focus to the minutes released two weeks later.\nThe MPC publishes statements after every meeting, along with a quarterly\nInﬂation Report that details the MPC’s two-year forecast for growth and inﬂation\nalong with justiﬁcation for policy movements. In addition, another publication,\ntheQuarterly Bulletin, provides information on past monetary policy movements\nand analysis of the international economic environment and its impacts on the UK\neconomy. All of these reports can provide guidance of future policy changes. The\nmain policy tools used by the MPC and BoE are the following.\nBank Repo Rate\nThis is the key rate used in monetary policy to meet the Treasury’s inﬂation target.\nThis rate is set for the Bank’s own operati ons in the market, such as its short-term\nlending activities. Changes to this rate affect the rates set by the commercial banks\nfor their savers and borrowers. In turn, this rate will affect spending and output in\nthe economy, and eventually costs and prices. An increase in this rate would imply\nan attempt to curb inﬂation and slow growth, while a decrease in this rate would be\naimed at stimulating growth and expansion.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe goal of open market operations is to implement changes in the bank repo rate,\nwhile assuring adequate liquidity in the market and continued stability in the banking\nsystem. This is reﬂective of the three main objectives of the BoE: maintaining the\nintegrity and value of the currency, maintaining the stability of the ﬁnancial system,\nand seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the United Kingdom’s ﬁnancial services.\nTo ensure liquidity, the Bank conducts daily open market operations to buy or sell\nshort-term government ﬁxed-income instruments. If this is not sufﬁcient to meet\nliquidity needs, the Bank would also conduct additional overnight operations.\nImportant Characteristics of the British Pound\n■GBPUSD is very liquid . The GBPUSD is one of the most liquid currencies in the\nworld, with 6% of all currency trading involving the British pound as either\nthe base or counter currency. It is also one of the three most liquid currencies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)227alongside EURUSD and USDJPY. One of the reasons for the currency’s liquidity\nis the country’s highly developed capital markets. Many foreign investors seeking\nopportunities other than the United States have sent their funds to the United\nKingdom for investment. In order to create these transactions, foreigners will\nneed to sell their local currency and buy British pounds.\n■GBP has three names . The UK’s currency has three names: the British pound,\nsterling, and cable. All of these are used interchangeably.\n■GBP is laden with speculators . At the time of publication, the British pound has one\nof the highest interest rates among the developed nations. Although Australia\nand New Zealand have higher interest rates, their ﬁnancial markets are not as\ndeveloped as that of the United Kingdom. As a result, many investors who already\nhave positions or are interested in initiating new carry trades positions frequently\nuse the GBP as the lending currency and will go long the pound against currencies\nsuch as the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. A carry trade involves\nbuying or lending a currency with a higher interest and selling or borrowing a\ncurrency with a lower interest rate. In recent years, carry trades have increased in\npopularity, which helped spur demand for the British pound. However, should the\ninterest rate yield differential bet ween the pound and other currencies narrow,\nan exodus of carry traders will increase volatility in the British pound.\n■Interest rate differentials between Gilt s and foreign bonds ar e closely followed . Interest rate\ndifferentials between UK Gilts—U.S. Tr easuries and UK Gilts and German Bunds\nare widely watched by FX market participants. Gilts versus Treasuries can be a\nbarometer of GBPUSD ﬂows, while Gilts versus Bunds can be used as a barometer\nfor EURGBP ﬂows. More speciﬁcally, these interest rate differentials indicate how\nmuch premium yield UK ﬁxed-income assets are offering over U.S. and European\n(German Bunds are usually used as a barometer for European yield) ﬁxed-income\nassets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders with indications of potential\ncapital ﬂow or currency movements, as global investors are always shifting their\ncapital in search of the assets with the highest yields. The United Kingdom can\nprovide these yields with the safety of having the same credit stability as the United\nStates.\n■Euro sterling futures can give indications for interest rate movements .S i n c et h eU K\ninterest rate or bank repo rate is the primary tool used in monetary policy, it is\nimportant to keep abreast of potential changes to the interest rate. Comments\nfrom government ofﬁcials is one way to gauge biases for potential rate changes,\nbut the Bank of England is one of the only central banks that requires members\nof the Monetary Policy Committee to publish their speciﬁc voting records.\nThis personal accountability indicates that comments by individual committee\nmembers represent their own opinions and not that of the BoE. Therefore,\nit is necessary to look for other indication of potential BoE rate movements.\nThree-month euro sterling futures reﬂect market expectations on euro sterling\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)228\nFIGURE 28.1 GBPUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\ninterest rates three months into the future. These contracts are also useful in\npredicting UK interest rate changes, which will ultimately affect the ﬂuctuations\nof the GBPUSD. Figure 28.1 illustrates 10 year performance of GBP-USD.\n■Comments on euro by UK politicians will impact the euro . Any speeches, remarks\n(especially from the Prime Minister or Treasury Chancellor), or polls in regards\nto the euro will impact currency trade. Indication of adoption of the euro tends\nto put downward pressure on GBP, while further opposition to euro entry will\ntypically boost the GBP. Reason being that in order for the GBP to come in line\nwith the euro, interest rates would have to decline and monetary policy would\nhave to be subjected to a foreign entity. A decrease in the interest rate would\ninduce carry trade investors to close their positions or sell pounds. The GBPUSD\nwould also decline because of the uncertainties involved with Euro adoption. The\nUK economy is performing very well under the direction of its current monetary\nauthority. The EMU is currently encountering many difﬁculties with member\ncountries breaching EMU criteria. With one monetary authority dictating 19\ncountries (plus UK would be 20), the EMU has yet to prove that they have\ndeveloped a monetary policy suitable for all member states.\n■GBP has positive correlation with energy prices . The UK houses some of the largest\nenergy companies in the world, including British Petroleum. Energy production\nrepresents 10% of GDP. As a result, the British pound tends to have a positive\ncorrelation with energy prices. Speciﬁcally, since many members of the EU\nimport oil from the United Kingdom, as oil prices increase, they will, in turn,\nhave to buy more pounds to fund their energy purchases. In addition, rises in the\nprice of oil will also beneﬁt the earnings of the nations’ energy exporters.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)229■GBP crosses . Although the GBP/USD is a more liquid currency than EURGBP,\nEURGBP is typically the leading gauge for GBP strength. The GBPUSD currency\npair tends to be more sensitive to U.S. developments, while EURGBP is a\nmore pure fundamental pound trade since Europe is Britain’s primary trade\nand investment partner. However, both currencies are naturally interdependent,\nwhich means movements in the EURGBP can affect movements in the GBPUSD.\nThe reverse is also true—that is, movements in GBPUSD will also affect trading\nin EURGBP. Therefore, it is important for pound traders to be consciously aware\nof the trading behavior of both currency pairs. The EURGBP rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURUSD divided by the GBPUSD rate. Small differences in\nthese rates are often exploited by market participants and quickly eliminated.\n■Important Economic Indicators\nfor the United Kingdom\nAll of the following indicators are important for the United Kingdom. However,\nsince the United Kingdom is primarily a service-oriented economy, it is particularly\nimportant to pay attention to service sector data.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the manufacturing,\nservice, and construction sectors. These numbers are extremely market moving\nbecause they provide the most up-to-date information on how each of the economies\nis performing in the current month and not how the economies performed\nthe previous month, like many other reports. However since the reports are for the\ncurrent period, they are usually subject to revisions, so the euro will move on the\npreliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents expansion, and a\nreading below 50 represents contraction. For the United Kingdom, the PMI services\nindex is the most important, along with the composite index, which aggregates how\nthe manufacturing and service sector are performing.\nEmployment Situation\nThe employment report is a monthly survey of the labor market conducted by\nthe Ofﬁce of National Statistics. The obj ectives of the survey are to divide the\nworking-age population into three separate classiﬁcations (employed, unemployed,\nand not in the labor force), and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of\nthese categories. Data from the survey provide market participants with information\non major labor market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors,\nhours worked, labor force participation, and unemployment rates. The timeliness\nof the survey makes it a closely watched s tatistic by the currency market as it is a\ngood barometer of the strength of the UK economy and an important input into\nmonetary policy.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)230Retail Sales\nThe key to growth is consumer spending, and for this reason, the retail sales report\nis also extremely market moving. The Retail Sales Index measures the total goods\nsold by a sampling of retail stores over the course of a month. This index is used as\na gauge of consumer consumption and consumer conﬁdence. While retail sales can\nbe quite volatile due to seasonality, it is one of the most important indicators on the\nhealth of the economy, along with a key input for GDP.\nConsumer or Retail Price Index\nCPI or RPI is a measure of the change in prices of a basket of consumer goods. The\nmarkets however focus on the underlying RPI or RPI-X, which excludes mortgage\ninterest payments. The RPI-X is closely watc hed as the treasury sets inﬂation targets\nfor the BoE, currently deﬁned as 2.5% annual growth in RPI-X.\nGDP\nGDP is a quarterly report conducted by the Bureau of Statistics. GDP is a measure\nof the total production and consumption of goods and services in the UK. GDP\nis measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses, government, and\nnet foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert output measured\nat current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used to gauge where in\nthe business cycle the United Kingdom ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is perceived\nas inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or weak\ngrowth.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures the change in output in the United\nKingdom of manufacturing; mining and quarrying; and electricity, gas, and water\nsupply. Output refers to the physical quantity of items produced, unlike sales value,\nwhich combines quantity and price. The index covers the production of goods and\npower for domestic sales in the United Kingdom and for export. Because IP is\nresponsible for close to a quarter of gross domestic product, IP is widely watched as\nit can provide good insight into the current state of the economy.\nUK Housing Starts\nHousing starts measures the number of residential building construction projects\nthat have begun during any particular month. This is important for the United\nKingdom as the housing market is the primary industry that sustains the economy.\n231CHAPTER 29\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nSwiss Franc (CHF)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nSwitzerland is the twentieth largest economy in the world, with a GDP valued at\nover US$685 billion as of 2014. Although the economy is relatively small, it is one of\nthe wealthiest in the world on a GDP per capita basis. The country is prosperous and\ntechnologically advanced with economic and political stability that rivals many larger\neconomies. The country’s prosperity stems primarily from technological expertise\nin manufacturing, tourism, and banking. More speciﬁcally, Switzerland is known for\ntheir chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, machinery, precision instruments,\nwatches, and a ﬁnancial system historically known for protecting the conﬁdentiality\nof its investors. This coupled with the country’s lengthy history of political neutrality\nearned Switzerland the Swiss franc safe haven status and as a direct result of that,\nit is the one world’s most popular destinations for offshore capital. Even when the\ncentral bank introduced a temporary 1.20 EURCHF peg and lowered interest rates\nto negative levels, Switzerland stil l managed to attract safe haven ﬂows.\nIt is estimated that Switzerland holds over US$2 trillion in offshore assets as of\n2014 and attracts over 35% of the world’s private wealth management business.\nA large and highly advanced banking and insurance industry has developed to support\nthis demand, and the sector employs over 50% of the population and comprises over\n70% of total GDP. Since Switzerland’s ﬁnancial industry thrives on its safe haven\nstatus and renowned conﬁdentiality, capital ﬂows tend to drive the economy during\ntimes of global risk aversion, while trade ﬂows drive the economy in a risk-seeking\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)232environment. Trade ﬂows are extremely important, with nearly two thirds of all\ntrade conducted with Europe. With this in mind, Switzerland’s most important\ntrading partners a re the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Germany\n2. India\n3. United States\n4. Hong Kong\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Italy\n3. United States\n4. France\n5. China\nTraditionally, Switzerland has a strong trade and current account surplus that\nlends support to the currency. Most of the surplus can be attributed to the large\namount of foreign direct investment into the country, in seek of safety of capital,\ndespite the low to negative yields offered by Switzerland.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Swiss\nNational Bank\nMonetary policy in Switzerland is determined by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). They\nare a completely independent authority with a three-person committee responsible\nfor determining monetary policy. This committee consists of a chairman, a vice\nchairman, and one other (member) who constitute the Governing Board of the\nSNB. Due to the small size of the committee, all decisions are based on a consensus\nvote. The Board reviews monetary policy at least once a quarter, but decisions on\nmonetary policy can be made and announced at any point in time. Unlike most other\ncentral banks, the SNB does not set one ofﬁcial interest rate target, but instead sets\na target range for their three-month Swiss Libor rate.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nIn December of 1999, the SNB shifted from focusing on monetary targets (M3) to an\ninﬂation target of less than 2% inﬂation per year. This measure is taken based on the\nnational consumer price index. Monetary targets still remain important indicators\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)233and are closely watched by the central bank, because they provide information on\nthe long-term inﬂation. This new inﬂation focus also increases the central bank’s\ntransparency. In their mandate, they have clearly stated, ‘‘Should inﬂation exceed\n2% in the medium term, the National Bank will tend to tighten its monetary stance.’’\nIf there is danger of deﬂation, the National Bank would loosen monetary policy. The\nSNB also closely monitors exchange rates, as excessive strength in the Swiss franc\ncan cause inﬂationary conditions. This is especially true in environments of global\nrisk aversion, as capital ﬂows into Switzerland increases signiﬁcantly during those\ntimes. As a result, the SNB typically favors a weak franc, and is not hesitant to use\nintervention as liquidity tool. SNB ofﬁcials intervene in the franc using a variety of\nmethods including verbal remarks on liquidity, money supply, and the currency.\nTheir Tools\nThe most commonly used tools by the SNB to implement monetary policy include\nthe following.\nTarget Interest Rate Range\nTraditionally, the SNB implements monetary policy by setting a target range for\ntheir three-month interest rate known as the Swiss Franc Libor rate. According\nto the SNB, ‘‘The Libor is a reference inte rest rate in the interbank market for\nunsecured loans.’’ It is a trimmed mean of the rates charged by 12 leading banks and\nis published daily by the British Bankers’ Association. The National Bank publishes\nits target range regularly. As a rule, this range extends over 1 percentage point,\nand the SNB generally aims to keep the Libor in the middle of the range. The SNB\nundertakes quarterly economic and monetary assessments at which it reviews its\nmonetary policy. If circumstances so require, it will also adjust the Libor target\nrange in between these quarterly assessments. It sets out the reasons for its decisions\nin press releases.\nOpen Market Operations\nRepo transactions are the SNB’s major monetary policy instrument. A repo\ntransaction involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider\n(lender), while agreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity\nat a later date. This structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker\nmust pay the cash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short\nmaturities ranging from one day to a few weeks. The SNB uses these repo transactions\nto manipulate undesirable moves in the three-month Libor rate. To prevent increases\nin the three-month Libor rate above the SNB’s target, the bank would supply the\ncommercial banks with additional liquidity through repo transactions at lower repo\nrates, and in essence create additional liquidity. Conversely, the SNB can reduce\nliquidity or induce increases in the three-month Libor rate by increasing repo rates.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)234In addition to the quarterly monetary policy decision, the SNB publishes a\nQuarterly Bulletin with a detailed assessment of the current state of the economy\nand a review of monetary policy. A Monthly Bulletin is also published containing a\nshort review of economic developments. These reports are important to watch, as\nthey may contain information on changes in the SNB’s assessment of economy and\nguidance on monetary policy.\n1.20 EUR/CHF Peg Implementation and Abandonment\nFew would have expected that one of the seminal developments in the forex market\nwas the Swiss National Bank’s decision to implement and later abandon its 1.20\nEURCHF peg. This decision transformed the foreign exchange industry, bankrupted\nmany brokers, and led to tighter regulations across the globe. Faced with a high level\nof uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued currency and deﬂation risks\nin 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At\nthe time, it pledged to sell francs in an unlimited quantity to maintain the peg. The\ngoal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping the gain in the franc. However,\nin January 2015, the prospect of quantitative easing from the European Central\nBank pushed the SNB to abandon the peg. It also accumulated signiﬁcant foreign\nexchange reserves that irritated critics, but more importantly, the franc became less\novervalued through the years, giving the SNB fewer reasons to maintain the peg.\nSNB’s decision was a complete surprise, and caused a 30% drop in EURCHF in\na single day. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\n■Important Characteristics of the Swiss Franc\n■Safe haven status . This is perhaps the most unique characteristic of the Swiss franc.\nSwitzerland’s safe haven status is continually stressed because this and the secrecy\nof the banking system are the key advantages of Switzerland. The Swiss franc\nmoves primarily on external events rather than domestic economic conditions.\nThat is, as mentioned earlier, due to its political neutrality, the franc is considered\nthe world’s premier safe haven currency. Therefore, in times of global instability\nand/or uncertainty, investors tend to be more concerned with capital retention\nthan appreciation. At such times, funds will ﬂow into Switzerland, which would\ncause the Swiss franc to appreciate regardless of whether growth conditions are\nfavorable.\n■Swiss franc is closely correlated with gold . Switzerland is the world’s third largest\nofﬁcial holder of gold. In the past, a Swiss constitutional mandate required the\ncurrency to be backed 40% with gold reserves. The mandate is now removed\nbut the positive correlation between the Swiss franc and gold remains because\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)235the relationship has been engrained into the minds of forex traders; therefore,\nboth gold and the Swiss franc are perceived as safe haven instruments. Before the\nSNB abandoned the EURCHF 1.20, Swiss franc had an 80% positive correlation\nwith gold. These days, the correlation is still there but in a smaller magnitude.\nGenerally speaking, if the price of gold appreciates, the Swiss franc has a high\nlikelihood of rising in value. In addition, since gold is also viewed as the ultimate\nsafe haven form of money, both gold and the Swiss franc beneﬁt during periods\nof global economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n■Carry trades effects . With one of the lowest interest rates in the industrialized world,\nover the past few years, the Swiss franc has become one of the most popular\nfunding currencies for carry trades. As mentioned in this book, the popularity of\ncarry trades has increased signiﬁcantly over the past two decades, as investors are\nactively seeking high yield. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency\nwith a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest\nrate. With CHF having one of the lowest interest rates of all industrialized\ncountries, it is one of the primary currencies sold or borrowed in carry trades.\nThis results in the need to sell CHF against a higher yielding currency. Carry\ntrades are typically done in cross-currencies such as GBPCHF or AUDCHF, but\nthese trades can impact both EURCHF and USDCHF. The unwinding of carry\ntrades involves the need for investors to buy back the Swiss franc.\n■Interest rate differentials between euro Swiss futures and foreign interest rate futures are\nclosely followed . One of the favorite indicators of professional Swiss franc traders\nis the interest rate differential bet ween three-month euro Swiss futures and\neurodollar futures. These differentials can provide guidance on potential money\nﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield U.S. ﬁxed-income assets are\noffering over Swiss ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides\ntraders with indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always\nlooking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry\ntraders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate\ndifferentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Potential changes in banking regulations . Over the past few years members of the\nEuropean Union have been exerting signiﬁcant pressure on Switzerland to relax\nthe conﬁdentiality of their banking system and to increase transparency of their\ncustomers’ accounts. The European Union is pressing this issue because of its\nactive measures to persecute EU tax evaders. This should be a concern for many\nyears to come. However, this is a difﬁcult decision for Switzerland to make because\nthe conﬁdentiality of their customers’ accounts represents the core strength of\ntheir banking system. The EU has threatened to impose severe sanctions on\nSwitzerland if they do not comply with their proposed measures. Both countries\nare currently working to negotiate an equitable resolution. Any news or talk of\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)236changing banking regulations will impact both Switzerland’s economy and the\nSwiss franc.\n■Mergers and acquisition activity . Switzerland’s primary industry is banking and\nﬁnance. In this industry, merger and acquisition activities (M&A) are very\ncommon, especially as consolidation continues in the overall industry. As a result,\nthese M&A activities can have signiﬁcant impact on the Swiss franc. If foreign\nﬁrms purchase Swiss banks or insurance companies, they will need to buy Swiss\nfrancs and in turn, sell their local currency. If Swiss banks purchase foreign ﬁrms,\nthey would need to sell Swiss francs and buy the foreign currency. Either way,\nit is important for Swiss franc traders to frequently watch for notices on M&A\nactivity involving Swiss ﬁrms.\n■Trading behavior, cross currency characteristics . The EURCHF is the most commonly\ntraded currency for traders who want to participate in CHF movements. USDCHF\nis less frequently traded because of its greater illiquidity and volatility. However,\nday traders may tend to favor USDCHF over EURCHF because of its volatile\nmovements. In actuality, the USDCHF is a synthetic currency derived from\nEURUSD and EURCHF because more tra nsactions are done between the euro\nand Swiss franc. Market makers or professional traders tend to use those pairs as\nleading indicators for trading USDCHF or to price the current USDCHF level\nwhen the currency pair is illiquid. Theoretically, the USDCHF rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURCHF rate divided by EURUSD. Only during times of\nunusual circumstances, such as the Iraq War, September 11, or the EURCHF peg,\nwill USDCHF develop a market of its own. Any small differences in these rates\nare quickly exploited by market participants. Figure 29.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of EUR-CHF.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Switzerland\nEconomic data from Switzerland tends to have limited impact on the currency, but\nthese are the most important pieces of Swiss data.\nKoF Leading Indicators\nThe KoF leading indicators report is released by the Swiss Institute for Business\nCycle Research. This index is generally used to gauge the future health of the\nSwiss economy. It contains six components: (1) change in manufacturers’ orders;\n(2) the expected purchase plans of manufacturers over the next three months; (3)\nthe judgment of stocks in wholesale business; (4) consumer perception of their\nﬁnancial conditions; (5) backlog in the construction sector; and (6) orders backlog\nfor manufacturers.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)\nk\nk237\nk\nk\nFIGURE 29.1 EURCHF 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)238Consumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index is calculated monthly, on the basis of retail prices paid in\nSwitzerland. In accordance with prevalent international practice, the commodities\ncovered are distinguished according to the consumption concept, which includes in\nthe calculation of the CPI of those goods and services that are part of the private\nconsumption aggregate according to the National Accounts. The basket of goods does\nnot include transfer expenditure such as direct taxation, social insurance contributions,\nand health insurance premiums. The index is a key measure of inﬂation.\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services in\nthe Switzerland. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Switzerland ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nBalance of Payments\nBalance of payments is the collective term for the accounts of Swiss transactions\nwith the rest of the world. The current account is the balance of trade plus services\nportion. BoP is an important indicator for Swiss traders, as Switzerland has always\nkept a strong current account balance. Any changes to the current account, positive\nor negative, could see substantial ﬂows.\nProduction Index (Industrial Production)\nThe production index is a quarterly measure of the change in the volume of industrial\nproduction (or physical output by producers).\nRetail Sales\nSwitzerland’s retail sales report is released on a monthly basis 40 days after the\nreference month. The report is an important indicator of consumer spending habits\nand is not seasonally adjusted.\n239CHAPTER 30\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nJapanese Yen (JPY)\n■Economic Overview\nJapan is the third largest economy in the world with GDP valued at over US$4.6\ntrillion in 2014 (behind the United States and China). If we count the European\nUnion as a whole, it would be considered the fourth largest economy. Japan is one of\nthe world’s largest exporters and is responsible for over US$690 billion in exports\nper year. Manufacturing and exports of products such as electronics and cars are the\nsignature drivers of the economy, accounting for nearly 17% of GDP. As a result,\nJapanese growth is extremely sensitive to the value of the currency. For many years,\nJapan has maintained a trade surplus, but the earthquake followed by tsunami in\n2011 turned the country into a net oil importer and created a long period of trade\nimbalances, where oil imports exceeded exports in value. This began to change in\nearly 2015, when a weakening yen and falling oil prices helped to turn around trade\nactivity, returning Japan to a surplus nation. Having a trade surplus means that there\nwill be inherent demand for the Japanese yen even when interest rates are low\nand there are structural deﬁciencies. Japan’s most important trade partners are the\nUnited States and China:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. South Korea\n4. Taiwan\n5. Hong Kong\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)240Leading Import Sources:\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. South Korea\n4. Australia\n5. Saudi Arabia\n■Abenomics\nIn the 1980s, Japan’s capital market was one of the most attractive markets for\ninternational investors seeking investment opportunities in Asia. Japan had the most\ndeveloped capital markets in the region, and its banking system was considered to\nbe the one of the strongest in the world. At the time, the country was experiencing\nabove-trend economic growth and near zero inﬂation. This resulted in rapid\ngrowth expectations, boosted asset prices, and rapid credit expansion, leading to the\ndevelopment of an a sset bubble. Between 1990 and 1997, the asset bubble collapsed,\ninducing a US$10 trillion decline in asset prices, with the fall in real estate values\naccounting for nearly 65% of the total decline, nearly two years of national output.\nThis fall in asset prices sparked the banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early\n1990s and developed into a full-blown systemic crisis in 1997 following the failure\nof a number of high-proﬁle ﬁnancial institutions. Many of these banks and ﬁnancial\ninstitutions extended loans to builders and real estate developers at the height of\nthe asset bubble in the 1980s, with land as collateral. A number of these developers\ndefaulted after the asset bubble collapse, leaving the country’s banks saddled with\nbad debt and collateral worth sometimes 60% to 80% less than when the loans\nwere taken out. Due to the large size of these banking institutions and their role in\ncorporate funding, the crisis had profound effects on Japan and the global economy.\nEnormous bad debts, falling stock prices, and a collapsing real estate sector crippled\nJapan’s economy for more than two decades.\nIt was not until the rollout of Abenomics that the economy began to turn around.\nWhen Shinzo Abe became prime minister for the second time in 2012, he rolled out\na three-pronged plan to stimulate growth and pull the economy out of stagnation\nthrough monetary policy, ﬁscal policy, and economic growth strategies. This was\nknown as Abenomics . In the ﬁrst few weeks of the pr ogram, Abe announced a massive\nstimulus package that involved signiﬁcant government spending and a strong dose\nof quantitative easing. The effects were almost immediate, with the Japanese yen\nfalling signiﬁcantly across the board. Not soon after, the unemployment rate started\nto fall and growth slowly returned.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)241■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers\nMonetary policy in Japan is determined by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). In 1998, the\nJapanese government passed laws giving the BoJ operational independence from the\nMinistry of Finance (MoF) and complete control over monetary policy. However,\ndespite the government’s attempts to decen tralize decision making, the MoF still\nremains in charge of foreign exchange policy. The BoJ is responsible for executing\nall ofﬁcial Japanese foreign exchange transactions at the direction of the MoF. The\nBank of Japan’s Policy Board consists of the BoJ governor, two deputy governors,\nand six other members. Monetary policy meetings are held twice a month, with\nbrieﬁngs and press releases provided immediately. The BoJ also publishes a Monthly\nReport issued by the Policy Board, and a Monthly Economic Report . These reports\nare important to watch for changes in BoJ sentiment and signals of new monetary\nor ﬁscal policy measures, as the government is constantly trying to develop fresh\ninitiatives to stimulate growth.\nThe MoF and the BoJ are very important institutions, and they both can\ninﬂuence currency movements. Since the MoF is the director of foreign exchange\ninterventions, it is important to watch and keep abreast of the comments made\nfrom MoF ofﬁcials. Being an export driven economy, the government tends to favor\na weaker currency. So if the Japanese yen appreciates signiﬁcantly or too rapidly\nagainst the dollar, members of the BoJ and MoF will become increasingly vocal about\ntheir concerns or disapproval in regards to its current level or recent movements.\nThese comments can affect how the yen moves, but if government ofﬁcials ﬂood the\nmarket with comments and there is no follow-up action, the market would start\nto become immune to these concerns. However, the MoF and BoJ have a lengthy\nhistory of interventions in the currency markets to manipulate the value of the yen\nvalue in Japan’s best interests, so their comments cannot be completely ignored.\nThe most popular tool that the BoJ uses to control monetary policy is open\nmarket operations.\nOpen Market Operations\nThese activities are focused on controlling th e uncollateralized overnight call rate.\nThe Bank of Japan has maintained a zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) for some time\nnow, which means that the Bank of Japan cannot lower this rate further to stimulate\ngrowth, consumption, or liquidity. Therefore, in order to maintain zero interest\nrates, the BoJ has to manipulate liquidity through open market operations, targeting\nzero interest on the overnight call rate. It manipulates liquidity by the outright\nbuying or selling of bills, repos, or Japanese government bonds. A repo transaction\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)242involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider (lender), while\nagreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date.\nThis structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the\ncash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities,\nranging from one day to a few weeks.\nImportant Characteristics of the JPY\n■Proxy for Asian strength/weakness . Japan tends to be seen as a proxy for broad Asian\nstrength because the country has the largest GDP in Asia outside of China. With\nthe most developed capital markets, Japan was once the primary destination for\nall investors who wanted access into the region. Japan also conducts a signiﬁcant\namount of trade with its Asian partners. As a result, economic problems or\npolitical instability in Japan tend to spill over into the other Asian countries.\nHowever, this spillover is not one-sided. Economic or political problems in\nother Asian economies, particularly China, can also have dramatic impacts on\nthe Japanese economy and in turn movements in the Japanese yen. For example,\nNorth Korean political instability poses a great risk to Japan and the Japanese yen\ndue to the country’s geographic proximity.\n■Bank of Japan intervention practices . The BoJ and MoF are active participants in\nthe foreign exchange markets. That is, t hey have a lengthy history of entering\nthe FX markets if they are d issatisﬁed with the value of the Japanese yen. While\nthey have not intervened since 2011, they won’t be reluctant to do so if the\ncurrency strengthens signiﬁcantly. As Japan is a very political economy, with\nclose ties between government ofﬁcials and principals of large private institutions,\nthe MoF can have a very narrow segment in mind when it decides to intervene\nin the currency. Since the BoJ is such an active participant, it is very in tune\nwith the market movements and its participants. Periodically, the BoJ receives\ninformation on large hedge fund positions from banks and likes to intervene when\nspeculators are on the other side of the market, allowing them to get the most\n‘‘bang for the bucks.’’ The MoF and BoJ always considers three main factors\nbefore intervention:\n1.Amount of appreciation/depreciation in JPY —Intervention has historically\noccurred when the yen moves by 7 or more yen in less than 6 weeks. Using\nthe USDJPY as a barometer, 7 yen would be equivalent to 700 pips, which\nwould represent a move from 120.00 to 127.00.\n2.Current USDJPY rate —Historically, only 11% of all BoJ interventions that\nwere conducted to counter a strong JPY occurred above the 115 level.\n3.Speculative positions— In order to maximize the impact of intervention, the\nBoJ and MoF prefer to intervene when market participants hold massive\npositions in the opposing direction because the ﬂow of stops will exacerbate\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)243the reversal in the currency pair. The CFTC provides a weekly report on\nexisting speculative positions that can be found at www.cftc.gov.\n■JPY movements are sensitive to time . The Japanese yen can be particularly active\ntowards the end of Japan’s ﬁscal year (March 31), as exporters repatriate their\ndollar denominated assets to window dress their balance sheets. This is particularly\nimportant for Japanese banks because they need to rebuild their balance sheets\nto meet FSA guidelines that require the banks to mark to market their security\nholdings. In anticipation of the need for repatriation-related purchases, Japanese\nyen speculators frequently bid the yen higher in attempt to take advantage of this\nincreased inﬂow. As a result, following ﬁscal year end, the Japanese yen tends to\nhave a bias toward depreciation as speculators close their positions.\nAside from the ﬁscal year end, time is also a factor on a day-to-day basis.\nUnlike traders in London or New York who typically have lunch at their trading\ndesk, Japanese traders tend to take hour-long lunches, leaving only a junior trader\nin the ofﬁce. On occasion, this can translate into additional volatility in the yen\nduring this period as the market becomes illiquid. In addition to this period, the\nJPY tends to move fairly orderly during Japanese and London hours, unless there\nare ofﬁcial comments or major surprises in economic data. During U.S. hours,\nhowever, the JPY tends to have higher volatility, as U.S. traders are actively\nengaging in dollar and yen positions.\n■Stocks and bonds have a positive correlation with USDJPY . The Nikkei has a positive\ncorrelation with USDJPY, which means that when the currency pair appreciating,\nequities are generally on the rise as well. For Japan, the currency typically leads\nequities because a weak yen is positive for the economy, but there can be times\nwhen equities lead currencies. The spread between U.S. 10-year Treasury and\nJGB yields is also very important for the currency. Typically, when the yield\nspread is on the rise, we see USDJPY move higher, and when the yield spread\ndeclines, it creates pressure on USDJPY. Figure 30.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of USDJPY.\n■Carry trade effects . The popularity of carry trades has increased in recent years, as\ninvestors are actively seeking high-yielding assets. With the Japanese yen having\nthe lowest interest rate of all industrialized countries, it is the primary currency\nsold or borrowed in carry trades. The most popular carry trade currencies\nincluded GBPJPY, AUDJPY, NZDJPY, and even USDJPY. Carry traders would\ngo short the Japanese yen against the higher yielding currencies. Unwinding of\ncarry trades as result of spread narrowing is typically beneﬁcial for the Japanese\nyen, as the reversal process involves purchasing the yen and buying back other\ncurrencies. Since there is so much demand to sell the yen for carry, in periods of\nrisk aversion, these trades can be unwound quickly creating a signiﬁcant rally in\nthe currency.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)244■Important Economic Indicators for Japan\nSince Japan is a manufacturing-oriented economy, manufacturing data tend to have\nthe most signiﬁcant impact on the yen. However, on a monthly basis, unless there is\na big surprise, Japanese data do not typically move the currency. The most inﬂuential\nevent risk is always the monetary policy announcement and trade balance. Aside\nfrom that, these are the numbers to watch.\nTankan Survey\nIf there is one piece of Japanese data to follow, it should be the quarterly Tankan\nReport. The Tankan is an economic survey of Japanese enterprises published four\ntimes a year. The survey includes more than 9,000 enterprises, which are divided\ninto four major groups: large, small, and medium-sized companies, as well as\nprincipal enterprises. The survey provides us with an overall impression of the\nbusiness climate in Japan and is widely watched and anticipated by foreign exchange\nmarket participants.\nBalance of Payments\nThe monthly balance of payments report provides investors with insight into Japan’s\ninternational economic transactions that include goods, services, investment income,\nand capital ﬂows. The current account side of BoJ can be used a good gauge of\ninternational trade. Figures are released on a monthly and semiannual basis.\nEmployment\nEmployment ﬁgures are reported on a monthly basis by the Management and\nCoordination Agency of Japan. The employment release measures the number of\njobs and unemployment rate for the country as a whole. The data are obtained\nthrough a statistical survey of the current labor force. This release is a closely\nwatched economic indicator because of its timeliness and its importance as a leading\nindicator of economic activity.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures trends in the output of Japanese\nmanufacturing, mining, and utilities companies. Output refers to the total quantity\nof items produced. The index covers the production of goods for domestic sales\nin Japan and for export. It excludes production in the agriculture, construction,\ntransportation, communication, trade, ﬁnance, and service industries; government\noutput; and imports. The IP index is then developed by weighting each component\naccording to its relative importance during this base period. Investors feel IP and\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)\nk\nk245\nk\nk\nFIGURE 30.1 USDJPY 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)246inventory accumulation have strong correlations with total output and can provide\nvaluable insight into the current state of the economy.\nGDP\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a broad measure of the total production and\nconsumption of goods and services measured over quarterly and yearly periods in\nJapan. GDP is measured by adding total expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. Preliminary reports\nare the most signiﬁcant for FX market participants.\n247CHAPTER 31\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nAustralian Dollar\n(AUD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nAustralia is the twelfth largest country in the world, with a gross domestic product\nof approximately US$1.5 trillion. In Asia, it ranks as the third largest economy\nin the region. On a relative basis, the economy is very small, only one-tenth\nthat of the United States and less than one-ﬁfth the size of China. However on a\nper capita basis, Australia ranks right up there with many industrialized Western\nEuropean countries. Australia has a service-oriented economy with close to 70%\nof GDP coming from industries such as ﬁnance, property, and business services.\nHowever, the country has a trade deﬁcit, with manufacturing dominating the\ncountry’s exporting activities. Rural and mineral exports account for over 60% of all\nmanufacturing exports and 12% of GDP. The economy is therefore highly sensitive\nto changes in commodity prices. As a country heavily dependent on exports, the\npace of growth of Australia’s largest trade partners is extremely important because\ndownturns or rapid growth abroad can impact import and export demand. Here’s a\nbreakdown of Australia’s most important trading partners:\nL a r g e s tE x p o r tM a r k e t s\n1. China\n2. Japan\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)2483. South Korea\n4. United States\n5. New Zealand\nLargest Import Sources\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. Japan\n4. Singapore\n5. Germany\nAs you can see, Australia’s number one trading partner is China. In fact, Chinese\ndemand represents a third of the country’s trade activity. In terms of products, the\nChinese are major importers of Australian iron ore, coal, natural gas, and gold.\nAsia Pac is extremely important to Australia, as more than 70% of its exports are\ndestined for countries within the region. This makes Australia’s economy highly\nsensitive to the performance of countries in the Asian Paciﬁc region. Hiccups in\nChina’s economy can have a signiﬁcant impact on Australia, not only in terms of\nexporting activities but also on housing market activity. At the same time, growth in\nChina is positive for Australia’s economy. During the global ﬁnancial crisis, exports\nto China helped shelter Australia from a major downturn. The relationship between\nChina and Australia is known as Sino-Australian relations. China has recently taken\nsteps to produce its own resources, and if this trend continues, it could dramatically\nchange the landscape of Australia’s economy.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is the central bank of Australia. The monetary\npolicy committee within the central bank consists of the governor (chairman), the\ndeputy governor (vice chairman), secretary to the treasurer, and six independent\nmembers appointed by the government. Changes to monetary policy are made on\nconsensus within the committee.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nThe RBA’s charter states t hat the mandate of the Reserve Bank Board is to focus\nmonetary and banking policy on ensuring:\n1. The stability of the currency of Australia;\n2. The maintenance of full employment in Australia; and\n3. The economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)249In order to achieve these objectives, the government has set an informal consumer\nprice inﬂation target of 2% to 3% per year. The RBA believes that the key to long-\nterm sustainable growth in the economy is to control inﬂation, which would preserve\nthe value of money. In addition, an inﬂation target provides a discipline for monetary\npolicy making and guidelines for private-sector inﬂation expectations. This also\nincreases the transparency of the banks’ activities. Should inﬂation or inﬂation\nexpectations exceed the 2% to 3% target, traders should know that it would raise\nred ﬂags at the RBA and prompt the central bank to favor a tighter monetary policy\nor, in the other words, further rate hikes.\nMonetary policy decisions involve setting the interest rate on overnight loans\nin the money market. Other interest rates in the economy are inﬂuenced by this\ninterest rate to varying degrees, so that the behavior of borrowers and lenders in\nthe ﬁnancial markets is affected by monetary policy (though not only by monetary\npolicy). Through these channels, monetary policy affects the economy in pursuit of\nthe goals just outlined.\nCash Rate\nThe cash rate is the RBA’s target rate for open market operations and is the rate\ncharged on overnight loans between ﬁnancial intermediaries. This means the cash\nrate should have a close relationship with the prevailing money market interest rates.\nChanges in monetary policy directly affect the interest rate structure of the ﬁnancial\nsystem. They also affect sentiment in a currency. Figure 31.1 graphs the AUDUSD\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.01. 2\n1. 1\n1. 0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n6/4/10 6/4/11 6/4/12AUDUSD vs. AU-US 10 Year Spread\n6/4/13 6/4/14 6/4/15\nAU-US Spread AUDUSD\nFIGURE 31.1 AUDUSD vs. 10-Year Yield Spread\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)250against the interest rate differential between Australia and the United States between\n2010 and 2015. There is clearly a positive c orrelation between the 10-year yield\nspread and the currency. Between June 2014 and June 2015, for example, the yield\nspread dropped from 1.5% to 0.5%, and thi s coincided with a drop in the AUDUSD\nfrom 95 to 76 cents.\nMaintaining the Cash Rate: Open Market Operations\nThe focus of daily open market operations is to keep the cash rate close to the target,\nby managing money market liquidity provided to commercial banks. If the Reserve\nBank wishes to decrease the cash rate, it would increase supply of short-dated\nrepurchase agreements at a lower interest rate than the prevailing cash rate, which\nwould in essence decrease the cash rate. If the Reserve Bank wishes to increase\nthe cash rate, it would decrease supply of short-dated repurchase agreements,\nwhich would increase the cash rate. A repurchase agreement involves a cash taker\n(commercial bank) selling securities to a cash provider (RBA), while agreeing to\nrepurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date. This structure\nis similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the cash provider\ninterest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities, ranging from\none day to a few weeks.\nAustralia has had a ﬂoating exchange rate since 1983, and the Reserve Bank\nof Australia may undertake foreign exchange market operations when the market\nthreatens to become excessively volatile or when the exchange rate is clearly\ninconsistent with underlying economic fundamentals. The RBA monitors a trade-\nweighted index (TWI), as well as the cross-rate with the U.S. dollar. Intervention\noperations are invariably aimed at stabilizing market conditions rather than meeting\nexchange rate targets.\nMonetary Policy Meetings\nThe RBA meets every month (except for January), on the ﬁrst Tuesday of each\nmonth, to discuss potential changes in monetary policy. Following each meeting, the\nRBA issues a press release outlining justiﬁcations for its monetary policy changes.\nIf it leaves rates unchanged, no statement is published. The RBA also publishes a\nmonthly Reserve Bank Bulletin . The May and November issues of the Reserve Bank\nBulletin include the semiannual statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy. The\nFebruary, May, August, and November issues contain a Quarterly Report on the\nEconomy and Financial Markets. It is important to read these bulletins for signals on\npotential monetary policy changes.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)251Important Characteristics of the Australian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . Historically, the Australian dollar has had a very strongly\ncorrelation (approximately 80%) with commodity prices and, more speciﬁcally,\ngold and iron ore prices. The correlation stems from the fact that Australia is\nthe world’s second largest gold producer and the world’s largest producer of\niron ore. Therefore, the price of iron ore and gold is extremely important to\nAustralia’s economy. However, unless there is a sharp movement in gold or\niron ore prices, it generally takes time for the AUDUSD to adjust to changes in\nthe price of commodities. Generally speaking, if commodity prices are strong,\ninﬂationary fears start to appear, and the RBA would be inclined to raise rates to\ncurb inﬂation. However, this is a sensitive topic, as gold prices tend to increase\nin times of global economic or political uncertainty. If the RBA increases rates\nduring those conditions, it leaves Australia more vulnerable to spillover effects.\n■Carry trade effects . Australia has one of highest interest rates among the developed\ncountries. With a fairly liquid currency, the Australian dollar is one of the most\npopular currencies to use for carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or\nlending a currency with a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency\nwith a low interest rate. The popularity of the carry trade has contributed to the\n57% rise of the Australian dollar aga inst the U.S. dolla r between 2001 and 2005.\nWhile the carry trade suffered great ly in 2008, it came back strongly between\n2009 and 2011. During this time, many foreign investors were looking for high\nyield when equity investments offered minimal returns. However, carry trades\nonly last as long as the actual yield advantage remains. If global central banks\nincrease their interest rates and the positive interest rate differential between\nAustralia and other countries narro w, the AUDUSD could s uffer from an exodus\nof carry traders.\n■Drought effects . Since the majority of Australia’s exports are commodities, the\ncountry’s GDP is highly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage\nthe country’s farming activities. For example, 2002 was a particularly difﬁcult\nyear for Australia, because the country was experiencing a severe drought. The\ndrought took an extreme toll on Australia’s farming activities, with dry conditions\nhampering the economy throughout the twenty-ﬁrst century. This is important\nbecause agriculture accounts for 3% of the country’s GDP. The RBA estimates\nthat the ‘‘decline in farm production could directly reduce GDP growth by\naround 1 percentage point.’’ Aside from exporting activities, a drought also has\nindirect effects on other aspects of Australia’s economy. Industries that supply and\nservice agriculture, such as the wholesale and transport sectors, as well as retail\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)252operations in rural farming areas, may also be negatively affected by a drought.\nHowever, it is also important to note that the Australian economy has a history\nof recovering strongly after a drought. The 1982–1983 drought ﬁrst subtracted\nthen subsequently added around 1% to 1 1∕2% to GDP growth. The 1991–1995\ndrought reduced GDP by around 1∕2to3∕4percentage points in 1991–1992 and\n1994–1995, but the recovery boosted GDP by 3∕4percentage points.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of Australia\nand the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries should\nalso be closely watched by Australian dollar traders. These differentials can be\ngood indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much premium\nyield Australian dollar short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Australia\nGDP\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services\nin Australia. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Australia ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth generally coincides with a\nweak growth period.\nCPI\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a basket\nof goods and services, which account for a high proportion of expenditure by the\nCPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation, and\nhealth. This is an important indicator to watch, as it is a key input for monetary\npolicy decisions.\nBalance of Goods and Services\nThis number is a monthly measure of Australia’s international trade in goods and\nservices on a balance of payments basis. General merchandise imports and exports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)\nk\nk253\nk\nk\nFIGURE 31.2 AUDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)254are derived mainly from international trade statistics, which are based on Australian\nCustoms Service records. The current account is the balance of trade plus services.\nPrivate Consumption\nThis is a national accounts measure that reﬂects current expenditure by households\nand producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes purchases of\ndurable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure by persons\non the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by unincorporated\nenterprises. This number is important to watch, as private consumption or consumer\nconsumption is the foundation for resilience in the Australian economy.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average\nchanges in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI\ntracks changes in prices for nearly every goods-producing industry in the domestic\neconomy, including agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries,\nmanufacturing, and mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally\nadjusted ﬁnished goods PPI and how the index has reacted on an m/m, q/q, h/h\nand y/y basis. Australia’s PPI data are released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 31.2 illustrates the 10 year performance of AUDUSD.\n255CHAPTER 32\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nNew Zealand Dollar\n(NZD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nNew Zealand is a very small economy with GDP valued at approximately\nUS$183 billion in 2013. In fact, there are less people living in New Zealand\nthan in New York City. It was once one of the most regulated countries within\nthe OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), but over\nthe past two decades the country has been moving toward a more open, modern,\nand stable economy. With the passing of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994, the\ncountry is shifting from an agricultural farming community to one that seeks to\nbecome a leading knowledge-based economy with high skills, high employment,\nand high value-added production. This act sets legal standards that hold the govern-\nment formally responsible to the public for its ﬁscal performance. It also sets the\nframework for the country’s macroeconomic policies. The following are the ﬁve\nprinciples outlined under the Fiscal Responsibility Act:\n1. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; by achieving surpluses on the\noperating budget every year until such a level is reached.\n2. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; and the government must ensure\nthat expenditure is lower than revenue.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)2563. Sufﬁcient levels of Crown net worth must be achieved and maintained to guard\nagainst adverse future events.\n4. Reasonable taxation policies must be followed.\n5. Fiscal risks facing the government must be prudently managed.\nNew Zealand also has highly developed manufacturing and services sectors,\nwith the agricultural industry driving the bulk of the country’s exports. The\neconomy is strongly trade-oriented, with exports of goods and services representing\napproximately one third of GDP. Due to the small size of the economy and its\nsigniﬁcant trade activities, New Zealand is highly sensitive to global performance,\nespecially of its key Asian trading partners, Australia, China, United States, and Japan.\nTogether, Australia, China, and Japan represent 42% of New Zealand’s trading\nactivity. It is also extremely sensitive to exchange rate ﬂuctuations, particularly\nagainst the Australian dollar. The fo llowing lists are a breakdown of the New\nZealand’s most important trading partners:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Australia\n2. China\n3. European Union\n4. United States\n5. Japan\nLeading Import Sources\n1. European Union\n2. China\n3. Australia\n4. United States\n5. Japan\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Reserve\nBank of New Zealand\nMonetary policy in New Zealand is determined by the Reserve Bank (RBNZ).\nThe Monetary Policy Committee is an internal committee of bank executives who\nreview monetary policy on a weekly basis. Meetings to decide on changes to\nmonetary policy occur eight ti mes a year, or approximate ly every six weeks. Unlike\nmost other central banks, the decision for rate changes rests ultimately on the bank’s\ngovernor. The current policy target agreements set by the minister and the governor\nfocus on maintaining policy stability and avoiding unnecessary instability in output,\ninterest rates, and the exchange rate. Price stability refers to maintaining the annual\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)257CPI inﬂation at 1.5%. If the RBNZ does not meet this target, the government has\nthe ability to dismiss the governor of the RBNZ. This is rarely done, but this serves\nas a strong incentive for the RBNZ to meets its inﬂation target. The most common\ntools used by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy changes are the following.\nOfﬁcial Cash Rate (OCR)\nThe Ofﬁcial Cash Rate is the rate set by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy.\nThe Bank lends overnight cash at 25 basis points above the OCR rate and receives\ndeposits or pays interest at 25 basis points below this rate. By controlling the cost\nof liquidity for commercial banks, the RBNZ can inﬂuence the interest rates offered\nto individuals and corporations. This effectively creates a 50 basis point corridor\nthat bounds the interbank overnight rate. The idea is then that banks offering funds\nabove the upper bound will attract few takers, because funds can be borrowed for\na lower cost from the RBNZ. Also, banks offering rates below the lower bound\nwill also attract few takers, because they are offering lower yields than the RBNZ.\nThe ofﬁcial cash rate is reviewed and manipulated with the goal of maintaining\neconomic stability.\nObjectives for Fiscal Policy\nOpen market operations on the other hand are used to meet the cash target. The\ncash target is the targeted amount of reserves held by registered banks. The RBNZ\nprepares forecasts of daily ﬂuctuations on the cash target and will then use these\nforecasts to determine the amount of funds to inject or withdraw in order to meet\nthe cash target. The following government objectives provide a guideline for ﬁscal\nand monetary policy measures:\n■Expenses : Expenses will average around 35% of GDP over the horizon used to\ncalculate contributions toward future New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) costs.\nDuring the buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs, expenses plus contributions\nwill be around 35% of GDP. In the longer term, expenses less withdrawals to\nmeet NZS costs will be around 35% of GDP.\n■Revenue : Raise sufﬁcient revenue to meet the operating balance objective. A\nrobust, broad-based tax system that raises revenue in a fair and efﬁcient way.\n■Operating balance : Operating surplus on average over the economic cycle sufﬁcient\nto meet the requirements for contributions toward future NZS costs and ensure\nconsistency with the debt objective.\n■Debt: Gross debt below 30% of GDP on average over the economic cycle. Net\ndebt, which excludes the assets to meet future NZS costs, below 20% of GDP on\naverage over the economic cycle.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)258■Net worth : Increase net worth consistent with the operating balance objective.\nThis will be achieved through a buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs.\nSource: New Zealand Treasury\n■Important Characteristics of the New Zealand\nDollar\nStrong Correlation with AUD—Competition with Australia\nAustralia is New Zealand’s largest trading partner. This coupled with their geographic\nproximity and New Zealand’s high dependence on trade, creates strong ties between\nthe economies of the two countries. When the Australian economy is healthy and\nAustralian corporations increase their importing activities, New Zealand will be one\nof the ﬁrst to beneﬁt. When it is weak, New Zealand suffers but in recent years\nits sensitivity has diminished because of the country’s growing trade with China\nand other nations. Nonetheless, 22% of trade is still conducted with Australia,\nand this explains why there is a positive correlation between the two currencies.\nFigure 32.1 shows how closely AUDUS D and NZDUSD have moved between 2005\nand 2015.\nCommodity-Linked Currency\nNew Zealand is an export driven economy with commodities representing over\n40% of the country’s exports, and as a result the New Zealand dollar has a strong\ncorrelation with commodity prices, particularly dairy. Fonterra is one of the world’s\n1. 2\n1. 1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.4AUDUSD vs. NZDUSD\n6/30/05 6/30/06 6/30/07 6/30/08 6/30/09 6/30/10 6/30/11 6/30/12 6/30/13 6/30/140.5\nAUDUSD NZDUSD\nFIGURE 32.1 AUDUSD versus NZDUSD\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)259leading dairy producer and also largest company in New Zealand. Twice a month\nthe Global Dairy Trade will conduct an auction and if prices rise, it will be positive\nfor the New Zealand dollar. If prices fall, it will be negative for the currency\nbecause it can mean reduced payout and proﬁt for dairy producers. The correlation\nbetween Australian and New Zealand dollars also contributes to the NZD’s status as a\n‘‘commodity linked’’ currency. Therefore, the New Zealand dollar’s correlation with\ncommodity prices is not only limited to its own trade activities. Therefore, as com-\nmodity prices increase, the Australian economy beneﬁts, translating into increased\nactivity in all aspects of the country’s operations, including trade with New Zealand.\nCarry Trades\nOf the industrialized countries, New Zealand tends to maintain the highest interest\nrate as it needs to offer investors a higher yield to compensate for the risk of\ninvesting in a small economy. This yield advantage along with its secure credit rating\nhas made the New Zealand dollar one of the most popular currencies to purchase\nfor carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. The\npopularity of the carry trade has contributed to the rise of the New Zealand dollar in\nan environment where many global investors are looking for opportunities to earn\nhigh yield. However, this also makes the New Zealand dollar particularly sensitive\nto changes in interest rates. That is, when the United States begins increasing their\ninterest rates, while New Zealand stays on hold or reduces their interest rates, the\ncarry advantage of the New Zealand dollar would narrow. In such situations, the\nNew Zealand dollar could come under pressure as speculators reverse their carry\ntrade positions.\nInterest Rate Differentials\nInterest rate differentials between the cash rates of New Zealand and the short\nterm interest rate yields of other industrialized countries are closely watched by\nprofessional NZD traders. These differentials can be good indicators of potential\nmoney ﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield NZD short-term ﬁxed-\nincome assets are offering over foreign short-term ﬁxed income assets, or vice versa.\nThis differential provides traders with indications of potential currency movements,\nas investors are always looking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly\nimportant to carry traders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive\ninterest rate differentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\nPopulation Migration\nAs mentioned earlier, New Zealand has a very small population, less than half of\nNew York City. Therefore, changes in migration can have signiﬁcant effects on the\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)260economy. Between 2013 an d 2014, the population of New Zealand increased by\n78,800 people, which was the largest net migration in at least 90 years. Between\n2011 and 2012, for example, the population only grew by 26,400 people. Although\nthese absolute numbers appear small, it is fairly signiﬁcant for New Zealand because\nof the size of the population. In fact, this strong population migration into New\nZealand has contributed signiﬁcantly to the performance of the economy, because\nas the population increases, the demand for household goods increases, leading to\nan increase in overall consumer consumption.\nDrought Effects\nSince the bulk of New Zealand’s exports are commodities, the country’s GDP is\nhighly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage the country’s farming\nactivities. In 2013, droughts cost the country over $1.3 billion. In addition, droughts\nare also very frequent in Australia, New Zealand’s largest trading partner, and when\nthey occur it can have a negative impact on the New Zealand economy.\n■Important Economic Indicators for New Zealand\nNew Zealand does not release economic indicators often; however, when they do,\nthe following items are the most important:\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a quarterly measure of the total production and consumption of goods and\nservices in New Zealand. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households,\nbusinesses, government, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used\nto convert output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. This data are\nused to gauge where in the business cycle New Zealand ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often\nis perceived inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nConsumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a\n‘‘basket’’ of goods and services that account for a high proportion of expenditure by\nthe CPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation,\nand health. This is an important indicator to watch, as monetary policy changes are\nhighly inﬂuenced by this index as it is a measure of inﬂation.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)\nk\nk261\nk\nk\nFIGURE 32.2 NZDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)262Balance of Goods and Services\nNew Zealand’s Balance of Payments statements are records of the value of New\nZealand’s transactions in goods, services, income, and transfers with the rest of the\nworld, and the changes in New Zealand’s ﬁnancial claims on (assets), and liabilities\nto, the rest of the world. New Zealand’s International Investment Position statement\nshows, at a particular point in time, the stock of a country’s international ﬁnancial\nassets and international ﬁnancial liabilities.\nRetail Sales Ex Inﬂation\nCredit card spending numbers are released for New Zealand on a monthly basis but\nthe retail sales data is quarterly on an ex inﬂation basis. This measure tracks the\nresale of new and used goods to the public for personal or household consumption.\nIt is also an important input into GDP.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a m/m, q/q, h/h, and y/y basis. New\nZealand’s PPI data is released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 32.2 illustrates the 10-year performance of NZDUSD.\n263CHAPTER 33\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nCanadian Dollar\n(CAD)\n■Broad Economic Performance\nCanada is the world’s eleventh largest country with GDP valued at US$1.8 trillion as\nof 2014. As a resource-based economy, the country’s early economic development\nhinged on the development, exploitation, and exports of natural resources. It is\nnow the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold. However, in actuality,\nnearly two-thirds of the country’s GDP comes from the service sector, which also\nemploys three out of four Canadians. The strength in the service sector is partly\nattributed to the trend by businesses to subcontract a large portion of their services.\nThis may include a manufacturing company subcontracting delivery services to a\ntransportation company. Despite this, manufacturing and resources are still very\nimportant for the Canadian economy, as it represents over 25% of the country’s\nexports and is a primary source of income for a number of provinces.\nThe Canadian economy started to advance with the depreciation of its currency\nagainst the U.S. dollar and the Free Trade Agreement that came into effect in January\n1989. This agreement eliminated almost all trade tariffs between the United States\nand Canada. As a result, Canada now exports over 85% of its goods to the United\nStates. Further negotiations to incorporate Mexico created the North American Free\nTrade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect on January 1994. This more advanced\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)264treaty eliminated most tariffs on trading b etween all three countries. Canada’s close\ntrade relationship with the United States makes it particularly sensitive to the health\nof the U.S. economy. If the U.S. economy sputters, demand for Canadian exports\nwould suffer. The same is true for the opposite scenario; if U.S. economic growth\nis robust, Canadian exports will beneﬁt. In the past decade, trade with China has\nalso increased signiﬁcantly, rising in the ranks from the ﬁfth to the second most\nimportant trade partner for Canada. The following is a breakdown of Canada’s key\nexport and import markets:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. United Kingdom\n4. Japan\n5. Mexico\nLeading Import Sources\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Japan\n4. Mexico\n5. United Kingdom\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Governing Council of the Bank of Canada is the board that is responsible for\nsetting Canadian monetary policy. This council consists of seven members: the\ngovernor and six deputy governors. The Bank of Canada meets approximately eight\ntimes per year to discuss changes in monetary policy. They also release a monthly\nmonetary policy update every quarter, but the rate decision itself is the big market\nmover for the currency.\nCentral Bank Goals\nThe Bank of Canada’s primary focus is on maintaining the ‘‘integrity and value of\nthe currency,’’ and this involves ensuring pri ce stability. Price stability is maintained\nby adhering to an inﬂation target currently set by the Department of Finance at\n1% to 3%. The Bank believes that high inﬂation can damage the functioning of the\neconomy. In their opinion, low inﬂation on the other hand equates to price stability,\nwhich can help to foster sustainable long-term economic growth. The BoC controls\ninﬂation through short-term interest rates. If inﬂation is above the target, the Bank\nwill apply tighter monetary conditions. If it is below the target, the Bank will loosen\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)265monetary policy. Overall, the central bank has done a pretty good job of keeping\nthe inﬂation target within the band since 1998.\nThe Bank measures monetary conditions using its Monetary Conditions Index,\nwhich is a weighted sum of changes in the 90-day commercial paper rate and G-10\ntrade-weighted exchange rates. The weight of the interest rate versus the exchange\nrate is 3 to 1, which is the affect of a chan ge in interest rates on the exchange rate\nbased on historical studies. This means that a 1% increase in short-term interest\nrates is the same as a 3% appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate. To\nchange monetary policy, the BoC manipulates the Bank Rate, which can in turn\naffect the exchange rate. If the currency appreciates to undesirable levels, the BoC\ncan decrease interest rates to offset the rise. If it depreciates, the BoC can raise rates.\nHowever, interest rate changes are not used for the purposes of manipulating the\nexchange rate. Instead, they are used to control inﬂation but an excessively strong\ncurrency and lower inﬂationary pressures can accelerate the changes. The following\nare the most commonly used tools by the BoC to implement monetary policy.\nBank Rate\nThe Bank Rate is the main rate used to control inﬂation. This is the rate of interest\nthat the Bank of Canada charges to commercial banks. Changes to this rate will affect\nother interest rates, including mortgage rates and prime rates charged by commercial\nbanks. Therefore, changes to this rate will ﬁlter into the overall economy.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) is the framework for the Bank of Canada’s\nimplementation of monetary policy. It is through this framework that Canada’s\ncommercial banks borrow and lend overnight money to each other in order to fund\ntheir daily transactions. The LVTS is an electronic platform through which these\nﬁnancial institutions conduct large transactions. The interest rate charged on these\novernight loans is called the overnight rate or bank rate. The BoC can manipulate the\novernight rate by offering to lend at rates lower or higher than the current market\nrate if the overnight lending rate is trading above or below the target banks.\nOn a regular basis, the bank releases a number of publications that are important to\nfollow. This includes a biannual Monetary Policy Report that contains an assessment of\nthe current economic environment and implications for inﬂation and a quarterly Bank\nof Canada Review that includes economic commentary, featured articles, speeches by\nmembers of the Governing Council, and important announcements.\nImportant Characteristics of the Canadian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . As the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold,\nCanada’s economy is highly dependent on commodities. This creates a strong\npositive correlation between the Canadian dollar and oil prices. Generally\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)266speaking, when oil prices rise, it beneﬁts domestic producers and increases their\nincome from exports. However at the same time, strong commodity prices can\nhurt growth abroad; so while rising oil prices are initially positive for Canada,\nthe negative impact on global growth could lead to a decline in demand over the\nmedium term. On the ﬂip side, falling oil prices are negative for the Canadian\ndollar; but if prices remain low and global growth beneﬁts, it can eventually\nneutralize the negative impact.\n■Strong correlation with the United States . Since the 1980s, Canada has been running\nmerchandise trade surpluses with the United States and now approximately 77%\nof Canadian exports are bound for the Untied States. This heavy reliance on U.S.,\ndemand makes Canada extremely sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy. As the\nU.S. economy accelerates, trade increases with Canadian companies, lifting overall\neconomic activity. However, as the U.S. economy slows, the Canadian economy\nwill be hurt signiﬁcantly as U.S. companies reduce their importing activities.\n■Mergers and acquisitions . Due to the proximity of the United States and Canada,\ncross-border mergers and acquisitions are very common, as companies worldwide\nstrive for globalization. These mergers and acquisitions lead to money ﬂowing\nbetween the two countries, which ulti mately impacts the currencies. In 2001,\nthe signiﬁcant U.S. acquisition of Canadian energy companies infused US$25\nbillion into Canada. This led to a strong rally in USDCAD, as the U.S. companies\nneeded to sell USD and buy CAD to pay for their acquisitions. Any similar type\nof M&A ﬂow in the future will also have a signiﬁcant but short-term impact on\nthe Canadian dollar.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of\nCanada and the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries\nare closely watched by professional Canadian dollar traders. These differentials\ncan be good indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much\npremium yield Canadian short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, and vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Carry trades . A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. When\nCanada has a higher interest rate than th e United States, the short USDCAD carry\ntrade becomes more attractive; but if th e United States emba rks on a tightening\ncampaign or Canada lowers rates, the positive interest rate differential between\nthe Canadian dollar and other currencies would narrow. In such situations, the\nCanadian dollar could come under pressure if the speculators begin to exit out of\ntheir carry trades.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)267■Important Economic Indicators for Canada\nCanadian economic reports can have a signiﬁcant impact on the currency. Here are\na handful of the most important releases.\nCanadian Employment\nEvery month, Canada releases its labor market report and this report provides more\ndetails than that of the United States. Job growth is expressed as net job growth and\nthen split into full- and part-time hirers. Generally speaking, the market prefers that\nthe bulk of job growth is full time, because it represents real long-term employment\nand not short-term hires that can be laid off at any time. The unemployment rate is\nalso released, and the number of unemployed persons is expressed as a percentage\nof the labor force.\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\nThe monthly consumer price report measures the average rate of increase in prices.\nWhen economists speak of inﬂation as an economic problem, they generally mean\na persistent increase in the general price level over a period of time, resulting in a\ndecline in a currency’s purchasing power. Inﬂation is often measured as a percentage\nincrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Canada’s inﬂation policy, as set out\nby the federal government and the Bank of Canada, aims to keep inﬂation within\na target range of 1% to 3%. If the rate of inﬂation is 10% a year, $100 worth of\npurchases last year will, on average, cost $110 this year. At the same inﬂation rate,\nthose purchases will cost $121 next year, and so on.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nThe gross domestic product measures the total value of all goods and services\nproduced within Canada during a given year. It is a measure of the income generated\nby production within Canada. GDP is also referred to as economic output. To\navoid counting the same output more than once, GDP includes only ﬁnal goods\nand services—not those that are used to make another product. For example, GDP\nwould not include the wheat used to make bread, but would include the bread itself.\nTrade Balance\nThe balance of trade is a statement of a country’s trade in goods (merchandise) and\nservices. It covers trade in products such as manufactured goods, raw materials, and\nagricultural goods, as well as travel and transportation. The balance of trade is the\ndifference between the value of the goods and services that a country exports and\nthe value of the goods and services that it imports. If a country’s exports exceed its\nimports, it has a trade surplus and the trade balance is said to be positive. If imports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)268\nFIGURE 33.1 USDCAD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nexceed exports, the country has a trade deﬁcit, and its trade balance is said to be\nnegative.\nRetail Sales\nRetail sales is a monthly national accounts measure that calculates current expenditure\nby households and producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes\npurchases of durable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure\nby persons on the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by\nunincorporated enterprises. Stronger consumer spending is positive for Canada’s\neconomy and, in turn, the Canadian dollar, whereas weaker consumer spending is\nnegative for Canada’s economy and currency.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.\nFigure 33.1 illustrates the 10-year

        "213CHAPTER 27\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nEuro (EUR)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe European Union (EU) was developed as an institutional framework for the\nconstruction of a united Europe. As of May 2015, the EU consists of 28 member\ncountries with 19 of these nations sharing the euro as a common currency. The\nEurozone consists of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,\nGreece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,\nPortugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. With the exception of Denmark and the\nUnited Kingdom, other EU states are obliged to join the monetary union when they\nmeet the criteria to do so. Aside from a common currency, these countries also\nshare a single monetary policy dictated by the European Central Bank (ECB). These\ncommon currency countries constitute the European Monetary Union (EMU).\nThe EMU is the world’s second largest economic power, with gross domestic\nproduct valued at approximately US$18 trillion in 2014. With a highly developed\nﬁxed income, equity, and futures market, the EMU is the second most attractive\ninvestment market for domestic and international investors. In its early days, the\nEMU found difﬁculty attracting foreign direct investment or large capital ﬂows\nbecause, historically, the U.S. markets are larger with more consistent returns. As\na result, the U.S. absorbs 71% of total foreign savings. However, with the euro\nbecoming an established currency and the European Monetary Union incorporating\nmore members, the euro’s importance as a reserve currency is rising and translating\ninto greater capital ﬂows. The only problem is that European bond markets are\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)214fragmented, and there are not enough quality assets for central banks to invest in.\nUnless there are euro bonds, foreign central banks could be slow to diversify their\nreserve holdings. Nonetheless, they will do so gradually, providing ongoing support\nfor the euro.\nTrade is extremely important to Eurozone nations and most countries conduct\nthe majority of their trade with other states in the region. This is important because\none of the most valuable aspects of the euro is its facilitation of trade activity through\nthe elimination of exchange rate risk. Large Eurozone nations such as Germany,\nFrance, Italy, and Spain also conduct signiﬁcant trade activity with countries like the\nUnited States and China. This makes the value of the euro particularly important\nto economic activity. A country like the United States is less sensitive to exchange\nrate ﬂuctuations because most of its demand is internal, but Europe is extremely\nsensitive to its exchange rate because many Eurozone nations rely on external\ndemand. The size and scope of the EMU’s trade with the rest of the world provides\nit with signiﬁcant power in the international trade arena. International clout is also\none of the primary goals in the formation of the European Union, because it allows\nindividual nations to negotiate as a group on an equal playing ﬁeld with the United\nStates and China, their two largest trading partners. The breakdowns of the most\nimportant trading partners for the European Union are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Switzerland\n4. Russia\n5. Turkey\nLeading Import Sources\n1. China\n2. Russia\n3. United States\n4. Norway\n5. Switzerland\nWhile trade is extremely important, the service sector has the largest share of\ntotal output followed by manufacturing. In fact, a large number of the companies\nwhose primary purpose is to produce ﬁnished products still concentrate their EU\nactivity on innovation, research, design, and marketing, while outsourcing most of\ntheir manufacturing activities to Asia.\nThe EU’s growing role in international trade has major implications for the role of\nthe euro as a reserve currency. As more countries conduct trade with the Eurozone,\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)215they will be motivated to accumulate more euros to reduce exchange risk and\ntransaction costs. Traditionally, most international trade transactions involve the\nBritish pound, the Japanese yen, and/or the U.S. dollar. Before the establishment of\nthe euro, it was unreasonable to hold large amounts of every individual EU national\ncurrency. As a result, currency reserves tended toward the dollar. At the end of the\n1990s, approximately 65% of all world reserves were held in U.S. dollars, but after\nthe introduction of the euro, foreign reserve assets slowly shifted towards the euro.\nThis trend will only continue as the world becomes more globalized.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nMakers—The European Central Bank\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is the governing body responsible for determining\nthe monetary policy of the countries participating in the EMU. The Executive Board\nof the EMU consists of the president of the ECB, the vice president of the ECB, and\nfour other members. These individuals, along with the governors of the national\ncentral banks, comprise the Governing Council. The ECB is set up such that the\nExecutive Board implements the policies dictated by the Governing Council. New\nmonetary policies decisions are typically made by majority vote, with the president\nhaving the casting vote in the event of a tie in their monthly meeting. After each\nmeeting the Central Bank president holds a press conference to answer questions.\nThis is also used as an opportunity to clarify their monetary policy stance.\nThe EMU’s primary objective is to maintain price stability and promote growth.\nMonetary and ﬁscal policy changes are made to ensure that this objective is met. With\nthe formation of the EMU, the Maastric ht Treaty was developed by the Union to\napply a number of criteria for each member country. These criteria were developed\nby the Union to help them achieve their objective. Deviations from these criteria\nby any one country will result in heavy ﬁnes. Listed below are the EMU criteria.\nIt is apparent based on these criteria that the ECB has a strict mandate focused on\ninﬂation and deﬁcit. Generally, the ECB strives to maintain annual growth in HCPI\n(Harmonized Consumer Price Index) below 2% and M3 (Money Supply) annual\ngrowth around 4.5%.\nThe EMU Criteria\nIn the 1992 Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) the following\npreconditions were created for any EU member state looking to join the economic\nand monetary union (EMU).\n■A rate of inﬂation no more than 1.5% above the average of the three best\nperforming member states, taking the average of the 12-month year-on-year rate\npreceding the assessment date.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)216■Long-term interest rates not exceeding the average rates of these low-inﬂation\nstates by more than 2% for the preceding 12 months.\n■Exchange rates which ﬂuctuate within the normal margins of the exchange-rate\nmechanism (ERM) for at least two years.\n■A general government debt/GDP ratio of not more than 60%, although a higher\nratio may be permissible if it is ‘‘sufﬁciently diminishing.’’\n■A general government deﬁcit not exceeding 3% of GDP, although a small and\ntemporary excess can be permitted.\nIf a country meets the convergence criteria and joins the EMU, their monetary\npolicy will be determined by the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB and the\nESCB (European System of Central Banks) are independent institutions from both\nnational governments and other EU institutions, granting them complete control\nover monetary policy. This operational independence is accorded to them as per\nArticle 108 of the Maastricht Treaty, which states that any member of the decision-\nmaking bodies cannot seek or take instructions from any Community Institutions,\nany government of a member state, or any other body. In other words, no one\ncountry can pressure the ECB into making a monetary policy change that is in only\ntheir best interest. The primary tools the ECB uses to control monetary policy is the\nfollowing.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe ECB has four main categories of open market operations to steer interest rates,\nmanage liquidity, and signal monetary policy stance. This includes:\n■Main reﬁnancing operations . These are regular liquidity-providing reverse transac-\ntions conducted weekly with a maturity o f two weeks, which provide the bulk of\nreﬁnancing to the ﬁnancial sector.\n■Longer-term reﬁnancing operations . These are liquidity-providing reverse transactions\nwith a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months, which provide\ncounterparties with additional longer-term reﬁnancing.\n■Fine-tuning operations . These are executed on an ad-hoc basis, with the aim of\nboth managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates, in\nparticular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected\nliquidity ﬂuctuations.\n■Structural operations . These involve the issuance of debt certiﬁcates, reverse trans-\nactions, and outright transactions. These operations will be executed whenever\nthe ECB wishes to adjust th e structural position of the Eurosystem vis-` a-vis the\nﬁnancial sector (on a regular or nonregular basis).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)217ECB Minimum Bid Rate (Repo Rate)\nThe ECB minimum bid rate is the key policy target for the ECB and the level of\nborrowing that the ECB offers to the central banks of its member states. This is also\nthe rate that is subject to change at the monthly ECB meetings. Since inﬂation is a\nmajor concern for European policy makers, they are generally more inclined to keep\ninterest rates at lofty levels to prevent inﬂation. Changes in the ECB’s minimum bid\nrate can have large ramiﬁcations for the EUR.\nThe ECB does not have an exchange rate target, but will factor in exchange rates\nin their policy deliberations because they can affect price stability. A high exchange\nrate lowers inﬂationary pressures while a low exchange rate promotes it. The ECB is\nnot prohibited from intervening in the foreign exchange markets if they believe that\ninﬂation is a concern. As a result, comments by members of the Governing Council\nare closely watched by forex traders and can have a signiﬁcant impact on the euro.\nIn addition to their monthly meetings, the Central Bank will also publish a\nmonthly bulletin and release staff forecasts and minutes from past meetings. The\npresident of the Central Bank holds a press conference after the policy meeting and\nthat, along with each of these event risk s, can cause volatility in the currency.\nNow let’s take a look at some of the important characteristics of the euro:\n■EURUSD cross is the most liquid and actively traded currency . The euro was introduced\nas an electronic currency in January 1999. At the time, the euro replaced all\npre-EMU currencies, except for Greece’s currency, which was converted to the\neuro in January 2001. As a result, the EURUSD cross is now the most liquid\ncurrency in the world and its movements are used as the primary gauge of the\nhealth of both the European and U.S. economies. Figure 27.1 highlights the\n10 year performance of EUR-USD. The euro is most frequently known as the\n‘‘anti-dollar’’ since dollar or U.S. fundamentals generally have a greater impact\non the movement of the currency.\nEURJPY and EURCHF are also very liquid currencies that can be used as a\ngauge of the health of the Japanese and Swiss economies. Many new traders will\nstart with the EURUSD because of its orderly movements, tight spread, and\nliquidity.\n■Euro: A currency without a country . One of the greatest problems of the euro is that it\nis currency without a country. Instead, it bears the economic, political, and social\nrisks of 19 different nations. This is its gr eatest strength and its greatest weakness.\nIn the past decade, we have seen how the debt crisis in smaller Eurozone nations\nhave affected the currency as a whole. It undermines conﬁdence and has, on many\noccasions, put the entire monetary union at risk.\n■Spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and 10-year Bunds can indicate euro sentiment .\nTen-year government bonds can serve as an important indicator of where the euro\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)218\nFIGURE 27.1 EURUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)219is headed, especially against the U.S. dollar. The differential between the 10-year\nU.S. government bond and the 10-year German Bund rates can provide a good\nindication for EURUSD’s movement. If Bund rates are higher than U.S. Treasury\nrates and the differential increases, or the spread widens, this is generally positive\nfor the EURUSD. Alternatively, a decrease in the differential or a tightening of\nthe interest rates is generally bearish for EURUSD. As there is no Euro bond,\nthe 10-year German Bund yield is typically used as the benchmark bond for the\nEurozone because Germany is the largest country in the monetary union.\n■Predictions for euro area money ﬂows . Another useful rate to follow is the three-month\ninterest rate, also known as the euro interbank offer rate or the Euribor rate. This\nis the rate offered from one large bank to another on interbank term deposits.\nTraders tend to compare the Euribor futures rate with the Eurodollar futures rate.\nEurodollars are deposits denominated in U.S. dollars at banks and other ﬁnancial\ninstitutions outside the United States. Because investors like high-yielding assets,\nEuropean ﬁxed-income assets become more attractive as the spread between\nEuribor futures and Eurodollar futures widens in favor of Euribors. As the spread\nnarrows, European assets become less attractive, whereby implying a potential\ndecrease in money ﬂows into the Euro.\nMergers and acquisition activity can also affect how the EURUSD moves.\nIn recent years we have seen increased M&A activity between EU and U.S.\nmultinationals. Large deals, especially with a large cash component, can lead to a\nsudden burst in the EURUSD, but the reaction is generally short-lived.\n■Important Indicators for the Euro\nWhen it comes to Eurozone economic reports, the only ones that affect the euro are\nGerman or Eurozone data. The largest countries in the Eurozone in order of GDP\ncontribution are Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. While French and Italian data\nare important, they rarely move the currency. So what forex traders should focus on\nare the broader regional reports and German data. Central bank rate decisions are\nthe most important, but here are some additional economic reports that can have\nmeaningful impact on the currency.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the Manufacturing\nand Service sectors. For the Eurozone, they provide this data for the four largest\neconomies and a composite index for the region. These numbers are extremely\nmarket moving because they provide the most up-to-date information on how each\nof the economies are performing in the current month and not how the economies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)220performed the previous month like many other reports. However, since the reports\nare for the current period, they are usually subject to revisions so the euro will\nmove on the preliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents\nexpansion, and a reading below 50 represents contraction. For the Eurozone, the\nmanufacturing PMI index is the most important along with the composite index,\nwhich aggregates how the manufacturing and service sector are performing. Since\nthe German data are released shortly before the Eurozone report, they can have a\ngreater impact on the currency.\nIFO Survey\nGermany is by far the largest economy in Europe and is responsible for approximately\n20% of total GDP. Any insight into German business conditions is seen as an insight\ninto Europe as a whole. The IFO is a monthly survey conducted by the IFO institute.\nThey survey over 7,000 German businesses, asking for their assessment of the\nGerman business climate and their short-term plans. The initial publication of the\nresults consists of the business climate headline ﬁgure and its two equally weighted\nsubindices: current business conditions and business expectations. The typical range\nis from 80 to 120, with a higher number indicating greater business conﬁdence. The\nreport is most valuable, however, when measured against previous data.\nInﬂation Indicators—HICP\nSince the ECB has an inﬂation mandate, the EU Harmonized Index of Consumer\nPrices (HICP) published by Eurostat is very important. This harmonized index is\ndesigned for international comparison as required by EU law. The index is compiled\nwith information on prices retrieved by each national statistical agency. Individual\ncountries are required to provide Eurostat with the 100 indices used to compute the\nHICP. The national HICPs are totaled by Eurostat as a weighted average of these\nsubindices, and the weights used are country-speciﬁc. The HICP is released at the\nend of the month following the reference period, which is about 10 days after the\npublications of the national CPIs from Spain and France, the ﬁnal EMU-5 countries\nto release their CPIs. Even if part of the information is already known when the\nHICP is released, it is an important release because it serves as the reference inﬂation\nindex for the ECB who aims to keep Eurozone consumer price inﬂation between\n0% and 2%.\nGerman Industrial Production\nIndustrial production data are seasonally adjusted (SA) and include a breakdown into\nfour major subcategories: mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction. The\nmanufacturing aggregate comprises four main product groups: basic and producer\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)221goods, capital goods, consumer durables, and consumer nondurables. The market\ntends to pay attention to the annual rate of change and the seasonally adjusted\nmonth-on-month ﬁgure. Germany’s ﬁgure is most important since it is the largest\ncountry in the Eurozone; however, the market can also react to the French industrial\nproduction report. The initial industrial production release is based on a narrower\ndata sample and hence subject to revision when the full sample has become available.\nThe ministry occasionally provides insight on the expected direction of the revision\nin the initial data release.\nGerman Unemployment\nLabor market numbers are important for every country and in the case of the\nEurozone, German unemployment is the most important. Released by the Labor\nOfﬁce, the data contain information on the number of unemployed, as well as\nthe changes on the previous month, on both seasonally (SA) and nonseasonally\n(NSA) adjusted terms. The NSA unemployment rate is provided, along with data\non vacancies, short-shift working arrangements, and the number of employees\n(temporarily suspended in 1999). Within an hour after the FLO release, the\nBundesbank releases the SA unemployment rate. The day ahead of the release,\nthere is often a leak of the ofﬁcial data from a trade-union source. The leak is\nusually of the NSA level of unemployment in millions. When a precise ﬁgure is\nreported on Reuters, as given by ‘‘sources’’ for the NSA level of unemployment,\nthe leak usually reﬂects t he ofﬁcial ﬁgures. Rumors often circulate up to one week\nbefore the ofﬁcial release, and they are notoriously imprecise. Regardless, a drop\nin unemployment along with an improvement in the jobless rate is positive for the\ncurrency, whereas a rise in jobless claims or increase in the unemployment rate is\nnegative for the currency.\nPreliminary GDP\nPreliminary GDP is issued when Eurostat has collected data from a sufﬁcient number\nof countries to produce an estimate. This usually includes France, Germany, and\nthe Netherlands. However, Italy is not included in the preliminary release and is\nonly added in the ﬁnal number. The yearly aggregates for EU-15 and EMU-11\nare a simple sum of national GDP. For the quarterly accounts, the aggregation is\nmore complex since some countries (Greece, Ireland, and Luxembourg) do not\nyet produce quarterly national accounts data. Moreover, Portugal produces only\npartial quarterly accounts with a signiﬁcant lag. Thus, both the EU-15 and EMU-11\nquarterly paths are the result of estimates from quarterly data based on a group of\ncountries accounting for more than 95% of total EU GDP (see the Foreword for a\ndetailed description of the weights of each country in the EU).\nCURRENCY PROFILE: EURO (EUR)222M3\nM3 is a broad measure of money supply, which includes everything from notes\nand coins to bank deposits. The ECB closely monitors M3 as they view it as a key\nmeasure of inﬂation. At its session in December 1998, the governing council of the\nECB set its ﬁrst reference value for M3 growth at 4.5%. This value supports inﬂation\nb e l o w2 % ,t r e n dg r o w t ho f2 %t o2 . 5 % ,a n dal o n g - t e r md e c l i n ei nt h ev e l o c i t y\nof money by 0.5% to 1%. The growth rate is monitored on a three-month moving\naverage basis in order to prevent monthly volatility to distort the information given\nby the aggregate. The ECB’s approach to monetary targeting leaves considerable\nroom for maneuver and interpretation. Because the ECB does not impose bands\non M3 growth, as the Bundesbank used to do, there will be no automatic action\nwhen M3 growth diverges from the reference value. Moreover, although the ECB\nconsiders M3 to be the key indicator, it will also take into account the changes in\nother monetary aggregates.\nIndividual Country Budget Deﬁcits\nThe Stability and Growth Pact states that budget deﬁcits for every country in the\nmonetary union must be kept below 3% of GDP. Failure to meet these targets will\nbe punished. However through the years many Eurozone nations have had deﬁcits\nin excess of 3% and penalties have not been enforced.\n223CHAPTER 28\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nBritish Pound (GBP)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nThe United Kingdom is the world’s ﬁfth largest economy with GDP valued at\napproximately US$3 trillion in 2014 according to the IMF. With one of the most\ndynamic central banks in the world, the UK economy beneﬁted from many years of\nstrong growth, low unemployment, expa nding output, and resilient consumption.\nThe strength of consumer consumption has been largely due to the strong housing\nmarket. The United Kingdom is a service-oriented economy, with manufacturing\nrepresenting an increasingly smaller portion of GDP, now equivalent to only one-\nﬁfth of national output. Their capital market system is one of the most developed\nin the world, with ﬁnance and banking being the strongest contributors to GDP.\nAlthough the majority of the UK’s GDP is from services, it is also one of the\nlargest producers and exporters of natural gas in the European Union. The energy\nproduction industry accounts for 10% of GDP, which is one of the highest shares of\nany industrialized nation. This is particularly important, as increases in energy prices\n(such as oil) will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt the large number of UK oil exporters. (The\nUnited Kingdom became a net oil importer for a brief period due to disruptions in\nthe North Sea in 2003, but it has already resumed its status as a net oil exporter.)\nOverall, the United Kingdom is a net importer of goods with a consistent\ntrade deﬁcit. Its largest trading partner is the EU, with trade between the two\nconstituencies accounting for over 50% of all of the country’s import and export\nactivities. The United States, on an individual basis, still remains the United\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)224Kingdom’s largest trading partner. The breakdowns of the most important trading\npartners for the United Kingdom are the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. Germany\n3. Switzerland\n4. Netherlands\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Netherlands\n3. China\n4. United States\n5. France\nSince the launch of the euro in 1999, the single currency’s troubles have become\nincreasingly apparent, and this has made the UK’s decision to maintain its own\ncurrency and monetary authority increasingly intelligent. Yet the possibility of euro\nadoption will remain a question in the minds of pound traders for many years\nto come, although in 2015 into 2016, the more relevant question is whether the\nUnited Kingdom will remain in the EMU. A decision on euro entry has signiﬁcant\nramiﬁcations for the UK economy—the most important of which is that UK interest\nrates would have to be adjusted to reﬂect the equivalent interest rate of the Eurozone.\nOne of the primary arguments against adopting the euro is that the UK government\nhas sound macroeconomic policies that have worked very well for the country for\ndecades. Its successful monetary and ﬁscal policies have led it to outperform most\nmajor economies during economic downturns, including the European Union.\nThe UK Treasury has previously speciﬁed ﬁve economic tests that must be met\nprior to euro entry, which are the following:\nUK’s Five Economic Tests for Euro\n1. Is there sustainable convergence in business cycles and economic structures\nbetween the United Kingdom and other EMU members, so that the UK citizens\ncould live comfortably with euro interest rates on a permanent basis?\n2. Is there enough ﬂexibility to cope with economic change?\n3. Would joining the EMU create an environment that would encourage ﬁrms to\ninvest in the United Kingdom?\n4. Would joining the EMU have a positive impact on the competitiveness of the\nUK’s ﬁnancial services industry?\n5. Would joining the EMU be good for promoting stability and growth in\nemployment?\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)225The United Kingdom is a very political country where government ofﬁcials are\nhighly concerned with voter approval. If voters do not support euro entry, the\nlikelihood of EMU entry would decline. The following are some of the arguments\nfor and against adopting the euro:\nArguments in Favor of Adopting the Euro\n■There would be reduced exchange rate uncertainty for UK businesses and lower\nexchange rate transa ction costs or risks.\n■The prospect of sustained low inﬂation under the governance of the European\nCentral Bank should reduce long-term interest rates and stimulate sustained\neconomic growth.\n■Single currency promotes price transparency.\n■The integration of national ﬁnancial markets of the EU will lead to higher efﬁciency\nin the allocation of capital in Europe.\n■The euro is the second most important reserve currency after the USD.\n■With the United Kingdom joining the euro, the political clout of the EMU would\nincrease dramatically.\nArguments against Adopting the Euro\n■Currency unions have collapsed in the past.\n■Economic or political instabilities of one country would impact the Euro, which\nwould have exchange rate ramiﬁcations for otherwise healthy countries.\n■Strict EMU criteria outlined by the Stability and Growth Pact.\n■Entry would mean a permanent transfer of domestic monetary authority to the\nEuropean Central Bank.\n■Joining a currency union with no monetary ﬂexibility would require the United\nKingdom to have more ﬂexibility in the labor and housing markets.\n■There are fears about which countries might dominate the ECB.\n■Adjusting to new currency will require large transaction costs.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Bank\nof England\nFor the United Kingdom, the Bank of England (BoE) controls monetary policy, and\nthe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is a nine-member committee responsible\nfor setting interest rate policy in the United Kingdom. It consists of a governor,\ntwo deputy governors, two executive directors of the central bank, and four outside\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)226experts. The committee was granted operational independence in 1997, which\nmeans they won’t be inﬂuenced by the governing party. Despite this independence,\nmonetary policies have centered on achieving an inﬂation target dictated by the\nChancellor of the Treasury. Currently, this target is RPIX (Retail Price Index)\ninﬂation of 2.5%. The central bank has the power to change interest rates to levels\nthat will allow them to meet this target. The MPC holds monthly meetings, which\nare closely followed for announcements on changes in monetary policy, including\nchanges in the interest rate (bank repo rate). When no changes are made, no details\nare provided. In this case, the rate decision is generally a nonevent for the currency,\nwith traders shifting their focus to the minutes released two weeks later.\nThe MPC publishes statements after every meeting, along with a quarterly\nInﬂation Report that details the MPC’s two-year forecast for growth and inﬂation\nalong with justiﬁcation for policy movements. In addition, another publication,\ntheQuarterly Bulletin, provides information on past monetary policy movements\nand analysis of the international economic environment and its impacts on the UK\neconomy. All of these reports can provide guidance of future policy changes. The\nmain policy tools used by the MPC and BoE are the following.\nBank Repo Rate\nThis is the key rate used in monetary policy to meet the Treasury’s inﬂation target.\nThis rate is set for the Bank’s own operati ons in the market, such as its short-term\nlending activities. Changes to this rate affect the rates set by the commercial banks\nfor their savers and borrowers. In turn, this rate will affect spending and output in\nthe economy, and eventually costs and prices. An increase in this rate would imply\nan attempt to curb inﬂation and slow growth, while a decrease in this rate would be\naimed at stimulating growth and expansion.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe goal of open market operations is to implement changes in the bank repo rate,\nwhile assuring adequate liquidity in the market and continued stability in the banking\nsystem. This is reﬂective of the three main objectives of the BoE: maintaining the\nintegrity and value of the currency, maintaining the stability of the ﬁnancial system,\nand seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the United Kingdom’s ﬁnancial services.\nTo ensure liquidity, the Bank conducts daily open market operations to buy or sell\nshort-term government ﬁxed-income instruments. If this is not sufﬁcient to meet\nliquidity needs, the Bank would also conduct additional overnight operations.\nImportant Characteristics of the British Pound\n■GBPUSD is very liquid . The GBPUSD is one of the most liquid currencies in the\nworld, with 6% of all currency trading involving the British pound as either\nthe base or counter currency. It is also one of the three most liquid currencies\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)227alongside EURUSD and USDJPY. One of the reasons for the currency’s liquidity\nis the country’s highly developed capital markets. Many foreign investors seeking\nopportunities other than the United States have sent their funds to the United\nKingdom for investment. In order to create these transactions, foreigners will\nneed to sell their local currency and buy British pounds.\n■GBP has three names . The UK’s currency has three names: the British pound,\nsterling, and cable. All of these are used interchangeably.\n■GBP is laden with speculators . At the time of publication, the British pound has one\nof the highest interest rates among the developed nations. Although Australia\nand New Zealand have higher interest rates, their ﬁnancial markets are not as\ndeveloped as that of the United Kingdom. As a result, many investors who already\nhave positions or are interested in initiating new carry trades positions frequently\nuse the GBP as the lending currency and will go long the pound against currencies\nsuch as the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. A carry trade involves\nbuying or lending a currency with a higher interest and selling or borrowing a\ncurrency with a lower interest rate. In recent years, carry trades have increased in\npopularity, which helped spur demand for the British pound. However, should the\ninterest rate yield differential bet ween the pound and other currencies narrow,\nan exodus of carry traders will increase volatility in the British pound.\n■Interest rate differentials between Gilt s and foreign bonds ar e closely followed . Interest rate\ndifferentials between UK Gilts—U.S. Tr easuries and UK Gilts and German Bunds\nare widely watched by FX market participants. Gilts versus Treasuries can be a\nbarometer of GBPUSD ﬂows, while Gilts versus Bunds can be used as a barometer\nfor EURGBP ﬂows. More speciﬁcally, these interest rate differentials indicate how\nmuch premium yield UK ﬁxed-income assets are offering over U.S. and European\n(German Bunds are usually used as a barometer for European yield) ﬁxed-income\nassets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders with indications of potential\ncapital ﬂow or currency movements, as global investors are always shifting their\ncapital in search of the assets with the highest yields. The United Kingdom can\nprovide these yields with the safety of having the same credit stability as the United\nStates.\n■Euro sterling futures can give indications for interest rate movements .S i n c et h eU K\ninterest rate or bank repo rate is the primary tool used in monetary policy, it is\nimportant to keep abreast of potential changes to the interest rate. Comments\nfrom government ofﬁcials is one way to gauge biases for potential rate changes,\nbut the Bank of England is one of the only central banks that requires members\nof the Monetary Policy Committee to publish their speciﬁc voting records.\nThis personal accountability indicates that comments by individual committee\nmembers represent their own opinions and not that of the BoE. Therefore,\nit is necessary to look for other indication of potential BoE rate movements.\nThree-month euro sterling futures reﬂect market expectations on euro sterling\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)228\nFIGURE 28.1 GBPUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\ninterest rates three months into the future. These contracts are also useful in\npredicting UK interest rate changes, which will ultimately affect the ﬂuctuations\nof the GBPUSD. Figure 28.1 illustrates 10 year performance of GBP-USD.\n■Comments on euro by UK politicians will impact the euro . Any speeches, remarks\n(especially from the Prime Minister or Treasury Chancellor), or polls in regards\nto the euro will impact currency trade. Indication of adoption of the euro tends\nto put downward pressure on GBP, while further opposition to euro entry will\ntypically boost the GBP. Reason being that in order for the GBP to come in line\nwith the euro, interest rates would have to decline and monetary policy would\nhave to be subjected to a foreign entity. A decrease in the interest rate would\ninduce carry trade investors to close their positions or sell pounds. The GBPUSD\nwould also decline because of the uncertainties involved with Euro adoption. The\nUK economy is performing very well under the direction of its current monetary\nauthority. The EMU is currently encountering many difﬁculties with member\ncountries breaching EMU criteria. With one monetary authority dictating 19\ncountries (plus UK would be 20), the EMU has yet to prove that they have\ndeveloped a monetary policy suitable for all member states.\n■GBP has positive correlation with energy prices . The UK houses some of the largest\nenergy companies in the world, including British Petroleum. Energy production\nrepresents 10% of GDP. As a result, the British pound tends to have a positive\ncorrelation with energy prices. Speciﬁcally, since many members of the EU\nimport oil from the United Kingdom, as oil prices increase, they will, in turn,\nhave to buy more pounds to fund their energy purchases. In addition, rises in the\nprice of oil will also beneﬁt the earnings of the nations’ energy exporters.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)229■GBP crosses . Although the GBP/USD is a more liquid currency than EURGBP,\nEURGBP is typically the leading gauge for GBP strength. The GBPUSD currency\npair tends to be more sensitive to U.S. developments, while EURGBP is a\nmore pure fundamental pound trade since Europe is Britain’s primary trade\nand investment partner. However, both currencies are naturally interdependent,\nwhich means movements in the EURGBP can affect movements in the GBPUSD.\nThe reverse is also true—that is, movements in GBPUSD will also affect trading\nin EURGBP. Therefore, it is important for pound traders to be consciously aware\nof the trading behavior of both currency pairs. The EURGBP rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURUSD divided by the GBPUSD rate. Small differences in\nthese rates are often exploited by market participants and quickly eliminated.\n■Important Economic Indicators\nfor the United Kingdom\nAll of the following indicators are important for the United Kingdom. However,\nsince the United Kingdom is primarily a service-oriented economy, it is particularly\nimportant to pay attention to service sector data.\nPMIs\nEvery month, Markit Economics releases the PMI indices for the manufacturing,\nservice, and construction sectors. These numbers are extremely market moving\nbecause they provide the most up-to-date information on how each of the economies\nis performing in the current month and not how the economies performed\nthe previous month, like many other reports. However since the reports are for the\ncurrent period, they are usually subject to revisions, so the euro will move on the\npreliminary and secondary reports. A reading above 50 represents expansion, and a\nreading below 50 represents contraction. For the United Kingdom, the PMI services\nindex is the most important, along with the composite index, which aggregates how\nthe manufacturing and service sector are performing.\nEmployment Situation\nThe employment report is a monthly survey of the labor market conducted by\nthe Ofﬁce of National Statistics. The obj ectives of the survey are to divide the\nworking-age population into three separate classiﬁcations (employed, unemployed,\nand not in the labor force), and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of\nthese categories. Data from the survey provide market participants with information\non major labor market trends such as shifts in employment across industrial sectors,\nhours worked, labor force participation, and unemployment rates. The timeliness\nof the survey makes it a closely watched s tatistic by the currency market as it is a\ngood barometer of the strength of the UK economy and an important input into\nmonetary policy.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: BRITISH POUND (GBP)230Retail Sales\nThe key to growth is consumer spending, and for this reason, the retail sales report\nis also extremely market moving. The Retail Sales Index measures the total goods\nsold by a sampling of retail stores over the course of a month. This index is used as\na gauge of consumer consumption and consumer conﬁdence. While retail sales can\nbe quite volatile due to seasonality, it is one of the most important indicators on the\nhealth of the economy, along with a key input for GDP.\nConsumer or Retail Price Index\nCPI or RPI is a measure of the change in prices of a basket of consumer goods. The\nmarkets however focus on the underlying RPI or RPI-X, which excludes mortgage\ninterest payments. The RPI-X is closely watc hed as the treasury sets inﬂation targets\nfor the BoE, currently deﬁned as 2.5% annual growth in RPI-X.\nGDP\nGDP is a quarterly report conducted by the Bureau of Statistics. GDP is a measure\nof the total production and consumption of goods and services in the UK. GDP\nis measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses, government, and\nnet foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert output measured\nat current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used to gauge where in\nthe business cycle the United Kingdom ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is perceived\nas inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or weak\ngrowth.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures the change in output in the United\nKingdom of manufacturing; mining and quarrying; and electricity, gas, and water\nsupply. Output refers to the physical quantity of items produced, unlike sales value,\nwhich combines quantity and price. The index covers the production of goods and\npower for domestic sales in the United Kingdom and for export. Because IP is\nresponsible for close to a quarter of gross domestic product, IP is widely watched as\nit can provide good insight into the current state of the economy.\nUK Housing Starts\nHousing starts measures the number of residential building construction projects\nthat have begun during any particular month. This is important for the United\nKingdom as the housing market is the primary industry that sustains the economy.\n231CHAPTER 29\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nSwiss Franc (CHF)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nSwitzerland is the twentieth largest economy in the world, with a GDP valued at\nover US$685 billion as of 2014. Although the economy is relatively small, it is one of\nthe wealthiest in the world on a GDP per capita basis. The country is prosperous and\ntechnologically advanced with economic and political stability that rivals many larger\neconomies. The country’s prosperity stems primarily from technological expertise\nin manufacturing, tourism, and banking. More speciﬁcally, Switzerland is known for\ntheir chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, machinery, precision instruments,\nwatches, and a ﬁnancial system historically known for protecting the conﬁdentiality\nof its investors. This coupled with the country’s lengthy history of political neutrality\nearned Switzerland the Swiss franc safe haven status and as a direct result of that,\nit is the one world’s most popular destinations for offshore capital. Even when the\ncentral bank introduced a temporary 1.20 EURCHF peg and lowered interest rates\nto negative levels, Switzerland stil l managed to attract safe haven ﬂows.\nIt is estimated that Switzerland holds over US$2 trillion in offshore assets as of\n2014 and attracts over 35% of the world’s private wealth management business.\nA large and highly advanced banking and insurance industry has developed to support\nthis demand, and the sector employs over 50% of the population and comprises over\n70% of total GDP. Since Switzerland’s ﬁnancial industry thrives on its safe haven\nstatus and renowned conﬁdentiality, capital ﬂows tend to drive the economy during\ntimes of global risk aversion, while trade ﬂows drive the economy in a risk-seeking\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)232environment. Trade ﬂows are extremely important, with nearly two thirds of all\ntrade conducted with Europe. With this in mind, Switzerland’s most important\ntrading partners a re the following:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Germany\n2. India\n3. United States\n4. Hong Kong\n5. France\nLeading Import Sources\n1. Germany\n2. Italy\n3. United States\n4. France\n5. China\nTraditionally, Switzerland has a strong trade and current account surplus that\nlends support to the currency. Most of the surplus can be attributed to the large\namount of foreign direct investment into the country, in seek of safety of capital,\ndespite the low to negative yields offered by Switzerland.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Swiss\nNational Bank\nMonetary policy in Switzerland is determined by the Swiss National Bank (SNB). They\nare a completely independent authority with a three-person committee responsible\nfor determining monetary policy. This committee consists of a chairman, a vice\nchairman, and one other (member) who constitute the Governing Board of the\nSNB. Due to the small size of the committee, all decisions are based on a consensus\nvote. The Board reviews monetary policy at least once a quarter, but decisions on\nmonetary policy can be made and announced at any point in time. Unlike most other\ncentral banks, the SNB does not set one ofﬁcial interest rate target, but instead sets\na target range for their three-month Swiss Libor rate.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nIn December of 1999, the SNB shifted from focusing on monetary targets (M3) to an\ninﬂation target of less than 2% inﬂation per year. This measure is taken based on the\nnational consumer price index. Monetary targets still remain important indicators\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)233and are closely watched by the central bank, because they provide information on\nthe long-term inﬂation. This new inﬂation focus also increases the central bank’s\ntransparency. In their mandate, they have clearly stated, ‘‘Should inﬂation exceed\n2% in the medium term, the National Bank will tend to tighten its monetary stance.’’\nIf there is danger of deﬂation, the National Bank would loosen monetary policy. The\nSNB also closely monitors exchange rates, as excessive strength in the Swiss franc\ncan cause inﬂationary conditions. This is especially true in environments of global\nrisk aversion, as capital ﬂows into Switzerland increases signiﬁcantly during those\ntimes. As a result, the SNB typically favors a weak franc, and is not hesitant to use\nintervention as liquidity tool. SNB ofﬁcials intervene in the franc using a variety of\nmethods including verbal remarks on liquidity, money supply, and the currency.\nTheir Tools\nThe most commonly used tools by the SNB to implement monetary policy include\nthe following.\nTarget Interest Rate Range\nTraditionally, the SNB implements monetary policy by setting a target range for\ntheir three-month interest rate known as the Swiss Franc Libor rate. According\nto the SNB, ‘‘The Libor is a reference inte rest rate in the interbank market for\nunsecured loans.’’ It is a trimmed mean of the rates charged by 12 leading banks and\nis published daily by the British Bankers’ Association. The National Bank publishes\nits target range regularly. As a rule, this range extends over 1 percentage point,\nand the SNB generally aims to keep the Libor in the middle of the range. The SNB\nundertakes quarterly economic and monetary assessments at which it reviews its\nmonetary policy. If circumstances so require, it will also adjust the Libor target\nrange in between these quarterly assessments. It sets out the reasons for its decisions\nin press releases.\nOpen Market Operations\nRepo transactions are the SNB’s major monetary policy instrument. A repo\ntransaction involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider\n(lender), while agreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity\nat a later date. This structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker\nmust pay the cash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short\nmaturities ranging from one day to a few weeks. The SNB uses these repo transactions\nto manipulate undesirable moves in the three-month Libor rate. To prevent increases\nin the three-month Libor rate above the SNB’s target, the bank would supply the\ncommercial banks with additional liquidity through repo transactions at lower repo\nrates, and in essence create additional liquidity. Conversely, the SNB can reduce\nliquidity or induce increases in the three-month Libor rate by increasing repo rates.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)234In addition to the quarterly monetary policy decision, the SNB publishes a\nQuarterly Bulletin with a detailed assessment of the current state of the economy\nand a review of monetary policy. A Monthly Bulletin is also published containing a\nshort review of economic developments. These reports are important to watch, as\nthey may contain information on changes in the SNB’s assessment of economy and\nguidance on monetary policy.\n1.20 EUR/CHF Peg Implementation and Abandonment\nFew would have expected that one of the seminal developments in the forex market\nwas the Swiss National Bank’s decision to implement and later abandon its 1.20\nEURCHF peg. This decision transformed the foreign exchange industry, bankrupted\nmany brokers, and led to tighter regulations across the globe. Faced with a high level\nof uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets, an overvalued currency and deﬂation risks\nin 2011, the SNB introduced a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. At\nthe time, it pledged to sell francs in an unlimited quantity to maintain the peg. The\ngoal was to stabilize the Swiss economy by capping the gain in the franc. However,\nin January 2015, the prospect of quantitative easing from the European Central\nBank pushed the SNB to abandon the peg. It also accumulated signiﬁcant foreign\nexchange reserves that irritated critics, but more importantly, the franc became less\novervalued through the years, giving the SNB fewer reasons to maintain the peg.\nSNB’s decision was a complete surprise, and caused a 30% drop in EURCHF in\na single day. Many foreign exchange brokers were unprepared for the move and\nexperienced massive losses as a result.\n■Important Characteristics of the Swiss Franc\n■Safe haven status . This is perhaps the most unique characteristic of the Swiss franc.\nSwitzerland’s safe haven status is continually stressed because this and the secrecy\nof the banking system are the key advantages of Switzerland. The Swiss franc\nmoves primarily on external events rather than domestic economic conditions.\nThat is, as mentioned earlier, due to its political neutrality, the franc is considered\nthe world’s premier safe haven currency. Therefore, in times of global instability\nand/or uncertainty, investors tend to be more concerned with capital retention\nthan appreciation. At such times, funds will ﬂow into Switzerland, which would\ncause the Swiss franc to appreciate regardless of whether growth conditions are\nfavorable.\n■Swiss franc is closely correlated with gold . Switzerland is the world’s third largest\nofﬁcial holder of gold. In the past, a Swiss constitutional mandate required the\ncurrency to be backed 40% with gold reserves. The mandate is now removed\nbut the positive correlation between the Swiss franc and gold remains because\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)235the relationship has been engrained into the minds of forex traders; therefore,\nboth gold and the Swiss franc are perceived as safe haven instruments. Before the\nSNB abandoned the EURCHF 1.20, Swiss franc had an 80% positive correlation\nwith gold. These days, the correlation is still there but in a smaller magnitude.\nGenerally speaking, if the price of gold appreciates, the Swiss franc has a high\nlikelihood of rising in value. In addition, since gold is also viewed as the ultimate\nsafe haven form of money, both gold and the Swiss franc beneﬁt during periods\nof global economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n■Carry trades effects . With one of the lowest interest rates in the industrialized world,\nover the past few years, the Swiss franc has become one of the most popular\nfunding currencies for carry trades. As mentioned in this book, the popularity of\ncarry trades has increased signiﬁcantly over the past two decades, as investors are\nactively seeking high yield. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency\nwith a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest\nrate. With CHF having one of the lowest interest rates of all industrialized\ncountries, it is one of the primary currencies sold or borrowed in carry trades.\nThis results in the need to sell CHF against a higher yielding currency. Carry\ntrades are typically done in cross-currencies such as GBPCHF or AUDCHF, but\nthese trades can impact both EURCHF and USDCHF. The unwinding of carry\ntrades involves the need for investors to buy back the Swiss franc.\n■Interest rate differentials between euro Swiss futures and foreign interest rate futures are\nclosely followed . One of the favorite indicators of professional Swiss franc traders\nis the interest rate differential bet ween three-month euro Swiss futures and\neurodollar futures. These differentials can provide guidance on potential money\nﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield U.S. ﬁxed-income assets are\noffering over Swiss ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides\ntraders with indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always\nlooking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry\ntraders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate\ndifferentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Potential changes in banking regulations . Over the past few years members of the\nEuropean Union have been exerting signiﬁcant pressure on Switzerland to relax\nthe conﬁdentiality of their banking system and to increase transparency of their\ncustomers’ accounts. The European Union is pressing this issue because of its\nactive measures to persecute EU tax evaders. This should be a concern for many\nyears to come. However, this is a difﬁcult decision for Switzerland to make because\nthe conﬁdentiality of their customers’ accounts represents the core strength of\ntheir banking system. The EU has threatened to impose severe sanctions on\nSwitzerland if they do not comply with their proposed measures. Both countries\nare currently working to negotiate an equitable resolution. Any news or talk of\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)236changing banking regulations will impact both Switzerland’s economy and the\nSwiss franc.\n■Mergers and acquisition activity . Switzerland’s primary industry is banking and\nﬁnance. In this industry, merger and acquisition activities (M&A) are very\ncommon, especially as consolidation continues in the overall industry. As a result,\nthese M&A activities can have signiﬁcant impact on the Swiss franc. If foreign\nﬁrms purchase Swiss banks or insurance companies, they will need to buy Swiss\nfrancs and in turn, sell their local currency. If Swiss banks purchase foreign ﬁrms,\nthey would need to sell Swiss francs and buy the foreign currency. Either way,\nit is important for Swiss franc traders to frequently watch for notices on M&A\nactivity involving Swiss ﬁrms.\n■Trading behavior, cross currency characteristics . The EURCHF is the most commonly\ntraded currency for traders who want to participate in CHF movements. USDCHF\nis less frequently traded because of its greater illiquidity and volatility. However,\nday traders may tend to favor USDCHF over EURCHF because of its volatile\nmovements. In actuality, the USDCHF is a synthetic currency derived from\nEURUSD and EURCHF because more tra nsactions are done between the euro\nand Swiss franc. Market makers or professional traders tend to use those pairs as\nleading indicators for trading USDCHF or to price the current USDCHF level\nwhen the currency pair is illiquid. Theoretically, the USDCHF rate should be\nexactly equal to the EURCHF rate divided by EURUSD. Only during times of\nunusual circumstances, such as the Iraq War, September 11, or the EURCHF peg,\nwill USDCHF develop a market of its own. Any small differences in these rates\nare quickly exploited by market participants. Figure 29.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of EUR-CHF.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Switzerland\nEconomic data from Switzerland tends to have limited impact on the currency, but\nthese are the most important pieces of Swiss data.\nKoF Leading Indicators\nThe KoF leading indicators report is released by the Swiss Institute for Business\nCycle Research. This index is generally used to gauge the future health of the\nSwiss economy. It contains six components: (1) change in manufacturers’ orders;\n(2) the expected purchase plans of manufacturers over the next three months; (3)\nthe judgment of stocks in wholesale business; (4) consumer perception of their\nﬁnancial conditions; (5) backlog in the construction sector; and (6) orders backlog\nfor manufacturers.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)\nk\nk237\nk\nk\nFIGURE 29.1 EURCHF 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: SWISS FRANC (CHF)238Consumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index is calculated monthly, on the basis of retail prices paid in\nSwitzerland. In accordance with prevalent international practice, the commodities\ncovered are distinguished according to the consumption concept, which includes in\nthe calculation of the CPI of those goods and services that are part of the private\nconsumption aggregate according to the National Accounts. The basket of goods does\nnot include transfer expenditure such as direct taxation, social insurance contributions,\nand health insurance premiums. The index is a key measure of inﬂation.\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services in\nthe Switzerland. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Switzerland ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nBalance of Payments\nBalance of payments is the collective term for the accounts of Swiss transactions\nwith the rest of the world. The current account is the balance of trade plus services\nportion. BoP is an important indicator for Swiss traders, as Switzerland has always\nkept a strong current account balance. Any changes to the current account, positive\nor negative, could see substantial ﬂows.\nProduction Index (Industrial Production)\nThe production index is a quarterly measure of the change in the volume of industrial\nproduction (or physical output by producers).\nRetail Sales\nSwitzerland’s retail sales report is released on a monthly basis 40 days after the\nreference month.

If we count the European\nUnion as a whole, it would be considered the fourth largest economy. Japan is one of\nthe world’s largest exporters and is responsible for over US$690 billion in exports\nper year. Manufacturing and exports of products such as electronics and cars are the\nsignature drivers of the economy, accounting for nearly 17% of GDP. As a result,\nJapanese growth is extremely sensitive to the value of the currency. For many years,\nJapan has maintained a trade surplus, but the earthquake followed by tsunami in\n2011 turned the country into a net oil importer and created a long period of trade\nimbalances, where oil imports exceeded exports in value. This began to change in\nearly 2015, when a weakening yen and falling oil prices helped to turn around trade\nactivity, returning Japan to a surplus nation. Having a trade surplus means that there\nwill be inherent demand for the Japanese yen even when interest rates are low\nand there are structural deﬁciencies. Japan’s most important trade partners are the\nUnited States and China:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. South Korea\n4. Taiwan\n5.

Saudi Arabia\n■Abenomics\nIn the 1980s, Japan’s capital market was one of the most attractive markets for\ninternational investors seeking investment opportunities in Asia. Japan had the most\ndeveloped capital markets in the region, and its banking system was considered to\nbe the one of the strongest in the world. At the time, the country was experiencing\nabove-trend economic growth and near zero inﬂation. This resulted in rapid\ngrowth expectations, boosted asset prices, and rapid credit expansion, leading to the\ndevelopment of an a sset bubble. Between 1990 and 1997, the asset bubble collapsed,\ninducing a US$10 trillion decline in asset prices, with the fall in real estate values\naccounting for nearly 65% of the total decline, nearly two years of national output.\nThis fall in asset prices sparked the banking crisis in Japan. It began in the early\n1990s and developed into a full-blown systemic crisis in 1997 following the failure\nof a number of high-proﬁle ﬁnancial institutions. Many of these banks and ﬁnancial\ninstitutions extended loans to builders and real estate developers at the height of\nthe asset bubble in the 1980s, with land as collateral. A number of these developers\ndefaulted after the asset bubble collapse, leaving the country’s banks saddled with\nbad debt and collateral worth sometimes 60% to 80% less than when the loans\nwere taken out. Due to the large size of these banking institutions and their role in\ncorporate funding, the crisis had profound effects on Japan and the global economy.\nEnormous bad debts, falling stock prices, and a collapsing real estate sector crippled\nJapan’s economy for more than two decades.\nIt was not until the rollout of Abenomics that the economy began to turn around.\nWhen Shinzo Abe became prime minister for the second time in 2012, he rolled out\na three-pronged plan to stimulate growth and pull the economy out of stagnation\nthrough monetary policy, ﬁscal policy, and economic growth strategies. This was\nknown as Abenomics . In the ﬁrst few weeks of the pr ogram, Abe announced a massive\nstimulus package that involved signiﬁcant government spending and a strong dose\nof quantitative easing. The effects were almost immediate, with the Japanese yen\nfalling signiﬁcantly across the board. Not soon after, the unemployment rate started\nto fall and growth slowly returned.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)241■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers\nMonetary policy in Japan is determined by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). In 1998, the\nJapanese government passed laws giving the BoJ operational independence from the\nMinistry of Finance (MoF) and complete control over monetary policy. However,\ndespite the government’s attempts to decen tralize decision making, the MoF still\nremains in charge of foreign exchange policy. The BoJ is responsible for executing\nall ofﬁcial Japanese foreign exchange transactions at the direction of the MoF. The\nBank of Japan’s Policy Board consists of the BoJ governor, two deputy governors,\nand six other members. Monetary policy meetings are held twice a month, with\nbrieﬁngs and press releases provided immediately. The BoJ also publishes a Monthly\nReport issued by the Policy Board, and a Monthly Economic Report . These reports\nare important to watch for changes in BoJ sentiment and signals of new monetary\nor ﬁscal policy measures, as the government is constantly trying to develop fresh\ninitiatives to stimulate growth.\nThe MoF and the BoJ are very important institutions, and they both can\ninﬂuence currency movements. Since the MoF is the director of foreign exchange\ninterventions, it is important to watch and keep abreast of the comments made\nfrom MoF ofﬁcials. Being an export driven economy, the government tends to favor\na weaker currency. So if the Japanese yen appreciates signiﬁcantly or too rapidly\nagainst the dollar, members of the BoJ and MoF will become increasingly vocal about\ntheir concerns or disapproval in regards to its current level or recent movements.\nThese comments can affect how the yen moves, but if government ofﬁcials ﬂood the\nmarket with comments and there is no follow-up action, the market would start\nto become immune to these concerns. However, the MoF and BoJ have a lengthy\nhistory of interventions in the currency markets to manipulate the value of the yen\nvalue in Japan’s best interests, so their comments cannot be completely ignored.\nThe most popular tool that the BoJ uses to control monetary policy is open\nmarket operations.\nOpen Market Operations\nThese activities are focused on controlling th e uncollateralized overnight call rate.\nThe Bank of Japan has maintained a zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) for some time\nnow, which means that the Bank of Japan cannot lower this rate further to stimulate\ngrowth, consumption, or liquidity. Therefore, in order to maintain zero interest\nrates, the BoJ has to manipulate liquidity through open market operations, targeting\nzero interest on the overnight call rate. It manipulates liquidity by the outright\nbuying or selling of bills, repos, or Japanese government bonds. A repo transaction\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)242involves a cash taker (borrower) selling securities to a cash provider (lender), while\nagreeing to repurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date.\nThis structure is similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the\ncash provider interest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities,\nranging from one day to a few weeks.\nImportant Characteristics of the JPY\n■Proxy for Asian strength/weakness . Japan tends to be seen as a proxy for broad Asian\nstrength because the country has the largest GDP in Asia outside of China. With\nthe most developed capital markets, Japan was once the primary destination for\nall investors who wanted access into the region. Japan also conducts a signiﬁcant\namount of trade with its Asian partners. As a result, economic problems or\npolitical instability in Japan tend to spill over into the other Asian countries.\nHowever, this spillover is not one-sided. Economic or political problems in\nother Asian economies, particularly China, can also have dramatic impacts on\nthe Japanese economy and in turn movements in the Japanese yen. For example,\nNorth Korean political instability poses a great risk to Japan and the Japanese yen\ndue to the country’s geographic proximity.\n■Bank of Japan intervention practices . The BoJ and MoF are active participants in\nthe foreign exchange markets. That is, t hey have a lengthy history of entering\nthe FX markets if they are d issatisﬁed with the value of the Japanese yen. While\nthey have not intervened since 2011, they won’t be reluctant to do so if the\ncurrency strengthens signiﬁcantly. As Japan is a very political economy, with\nclose ties between government ofﬁcials and principals of large private institutions,\nthe MoF can have a very narrow segment in mind when it decides to intervene\nin the currency. Since the BoJ is such an active participant, it is very in tune\nwith the market movements and its participants. Periodically, the BoJ receives\ninformation on large hedge fund positions from banks and likes to intervene when\nspeculators are on the other side of the market, allowing them to get the most\n‘‘bang for the bucks.’’ The MoF and BoJ always considers three main factors\nbefore intervention:\n1.Amount of appreciation/depreciation in JPY —Intervention has historically\noccurred when the yen moves by 7 or more yen in less than 6 weeks. Using\nthe USDJPY as a barometer, 7 yen would be equivalent to 700 pips, which\nwould represent a move from 120.00 to 127.00.\n2.Current USDJPY rate —Historically, only 11% of all BoJ interventions that\nwere conducted to counter a strong JPY occurred above the 115 level.\n3.Speculative positions— In order to maximize the impact of intervention, the\nBoJ and MoF prefer to intervene when market participants hold massive\npositions in the opposing direction because the ﬂow of stops will exacerbate\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)243the reversal in the currency pair. The CFTC provides a weekly report on\nexisting speculative positions that can be found at www.cftc.gov.\n■JPY movements are sensitive to time . The Japanese yen can be particularly active\ntowards the end of Japan’s ﬁscal year (March 31), as exporters repatriate their\ndollar denominated assets to window dress their balance sheets. This is particularly\nimportant for Japanese banks because they need to rebuild their balance sheets\nto meet FSA guidelines that require the banks to mark to market their security\nholdings. In anticipation of the need for repatriation-related purchases, Japanese\nyen speculators frequently bid the yen higher in attempt to take advantage of this\nincreased inﬂow. As a result, following ﬁscal year end, the Japanese yen tends to\nhave a bias toward depreciation as speculators close their positions.\nAside from the ﬁscal year end, time is also a factor on a day-to-day basis.\nUnlike traders in London or New York who typically have lunch at their trading\ndesk, Japanese traders tend to take hour-long lunches, leaving only a junior trader\nin the ofﬁce. On occasion, this can translate into additional volatility in the yen\nduring this period as the market becomes illiquid. In addition to this period, the\nJPY tends to move fairly orderly during Japanese and London hours, unless there\nare ofﬁcial comments or major surprises in economic data. During U.S. hours,\nhowever, the JPY tends to have higher volatility, as U.S. traders are actively\nengaging in dollar and yen positions.\n■Stocks and bonds have a positive correlation with USDJPY . The Nikkei has a positive\ncorrelation with USDJPY, which means that when the currency pair appreciating,\nequities are generally on the rise as well. For Japan, the currency typically leads\nequities because a weak yen is positive for the economy, but there can be times\nwhen equities lead currencies. The spread between U.S. 10-year Treasury and\nJGB yields is also very important for the currency. Typically, when the yield\nspread is on the rise, we see USDJPY move higher, and when the yield spread\ndeclines, it creates pressure on USDJPY. Figure 30.1 highlights the 10 year\nperformance of USDJPY.\n■Carry trade effects . The popularity of carry trades has increased in recent years, as\ninvestors are actively seeking high-yielding assets. With the Japanese yen having\nthe lowest interest rate of all industrialized countries, it is the primary currency\nsold or borrowed in carry trades. The most popular carry trade currencies\nincluded GBPJPY, AUDJPY, NZDJPY, and even USDJPY. Carry traders would\ngo short the Japanese yen against the higher yielding currencies. Unwinding of\ncarry trades as result of spread narrowing is typically beneﬁcial for the Japanese\nyen, as the reversal process involves purchasing the yen and buying back other\ncurrencies. Since there is so much demand to sell the yen for carry, in periods of\nrisk aversion, these trades can be unwound quickly creating a signiﬁcant rally in\nthe currency.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)244■Important Economic Indicators for Japan\nSince Japan is a manufacturing-oriented economy, manufacturing data tend to have\nthe most signiﬁcant impact on the yen. However, on a monthly basis, unless there is\na big surprise, Japanese data do not typically move the currency. The most inﬂuential\nevent risk is always the monetary policy announcement and trade balance. Aside\nfrom that, these are the numbers to watch.\nTankan Survey\nIf there is one piece of Japanese data to follow, it should be the quarterly Tankan\nReport. The Tankan is an economic survey of Japanese enterprises published four\ntimes a year. The survey includes more than 9,000 enterprises, which are divided\ninto four major groups: large, small, and medium-sized companies, as well as\nprincipal enterprises. The survey provides us with an overall impression of the\nbusiness climate in Japan and is widely watched and anticipated by foreign exchange\nmarket participants.\nBalance of Payments\nThe monthly balance of payments report provides investors with insight into Japan’s\ninternational economic transactions that include goods, services, investment income,\nand capital ﬂows. The current account side of BoJ can be used a good gauge of\ninternational trade. Figures are released on a monthly and semiannual basis.\nEmployment\nEmployment ﬁgures are reported on a monthly basis by the Management and\nCoordination Agency of Japan. The employment release measures the number of\njobs and unemployment rate for the country as a whole. The data are obtained\nthrough a statistical survey of the current labor force. This release is a closely\nwatched economic indicator because of its timeliness and its importance as a leading\nindicator of economic activity.\nIndustrial Production\nThe industrial production (IP) index measures trends in the output of Japanese\nmanufacturing, mining, and utilities companies. Output refers to the total quantity\nof items produced. The index covers the production of goods for domestic sales\nin Japan and for export. It excludes production in the agriculture, construction,\ntransportation, communication, trade, ﬁnance, and service industries; government\noutput; and imports. The IP index is then developed by weighting each component\naccording to its relative importance during this base period. Investors feel IP and\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)\nk\nk245\nk\nk\nFIGURE 30.1 USDJPY 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: JAPANESE YEN (JPY)246inventory accumulation have strong correlations with total output and can provide\nvaluable insight into the current state of the economy.\nGDP\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a broad measure of the total production and\nconsumption of goods and services measured over quarterly and yearly periods in\nJapan. GDP is measured by adding total expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. Preliminary reports\nare the most signiﬁcant for FX market participants.\n247CHAPTER 31\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nAustralian Dollar\n(AUD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nAustralia is the twelfth largest country in the world, with a gross domestic product\nof approximately US$1.5 trillion. In Asia, it ranks as the third largest economy\nin the region. On a relative basis, the economy is very small, only one-tenth\nthat of the United States and less than one-ﬁfth the size of China. However on a\nper capita basis, Australia ranks right up there with many industrialized Western\nEuropean countries. Australia has a service-oriented economy with close to 70%\nof GDP coming from industries such as ﬁnance, property, and business services.\nHowever, the country has a trade deﬁcit, with manufacturing dominating the\ncountry’s exporting activities. Rural and mineral exports account for over 60% of all\nmanufacturing exports and 12% of GDP. The economy is therefore highly sensitive\nto changes in commodity prices. As a country heavily dependent on exports, the\npace of growth of Australia’s largest trade partners is extremely important because\ndownturns or rapid growth abroad can impact import and export demand. Here’s a\nbreakdown of Australia’s most important trading partners:\nL a r g e s tE x p o r tM a r k e t s\n1. China\n2. Japan\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)2483. South Korea\n4. United States\n5. New Zealand\nLargest Import Sources\n1. China\n2. United States\n3. Japan\n4. Singapore\n5. Germany\nAs you can see, Australia’s number one trading partner is China. In fact, Chinese\ndemand represents a third of the country’s trade activity. In terms of products, the\nChinese are major importers of Australian iron ore, coal, natural gas, and gold.\nAsia Pac is extremely important to Australia, as more than 70% of its exports are\ndestined for countries within the region. This makes Australia’s economy highly\nsensitive to the performance of countries in the Asian Paciﬁc region. Hiccups in\nChina’s economy can have a signiﬁcant impact on Australia, not only in terms of\nexporting activities but also on housing market activity. At the same time, growth in\nChina is positive for Australia’s economy. During the global ﬁnancial crisis, exports\nto China helped shelter Australia from a major downturn. The relationship between\nChina and Australia is known as Sino-Australian relations. China has recently taken\nsteps to produce its own resources, and if this trend continues, it could dramatically\nchange the landscape of Australia’s economy.\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is the central bank of Australia. The monetary\npolicy committee within the central bank consists of the governor (chairman), the\ndeputy governor (vice chairman), secretary to the treasurer, and six independent\nmembers appointed by the government. Changes to monetary policy are made on\nconsensus within the committee.\nCentral Bank’s Goals\nThe RBA’s charter states t hat the mandate of the Reserve Bank Board is to focus\nmonetary and banking policy on ensuring:\n1. The stability of the currency of Australia;\n2. The maintenance of full employment in Australia; and\n3. The economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)249In order to achieve these objectives, the government has set an informal consumer\nprice inﬂation target of 2% to 3% per year. The RBA believes that the key to long-\nterm sustainable growth in the economy is to control inﬂation, which would preserve\nthe value of money. In addition, an inﬂation target provides a discipline for monetary\npolicy making and guidelines for private-sector inﬂation expectations. This also\nincreases the transparency of the banks’ activities. Should inﬂation or inﬂation\nexpectations exceed the 2% to 3% target, traders should know that it would raise\nred ﬂags at the RBA and prompt the central bank to favor a tighter monetary policy\nor, in the other words, further rate hikes.\nMonetary policy decisions involve setting the interest rate on overnight loans\nin the money market. Other interest rates in the economy are inﬂuenced by this\ninterest rate to varying degrees, so that the behavior of borrowers and lenders in\nthe ﬁnancial markets is affected by monetary policy (though not only by monetary\npolicy). Through these channels, monetary policy affects the economy in pursuit of\nthe goals just outlined.\nCash Rate\nThe cash rate is the RBA’s target rate for open market operations and is the rate\ncharged on overnight loans between ﬁnancial intermediaries. This means the cash\nrate should have a close relationship with the prevailing money market interest rates.\nChanges in monetary policy directly affect the interest rate structure of the ﬁnancial\nsystem. They also affect sentiment in a currency. Figure 31.1 graphs the AUDUSD\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1. 5\n1. 0\n0.5\n0.01. 2\n1. 1\n1. 0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n6/4/10 6/4/11 6/4/12AUDUSD vs. AU-US 10 Year Spread\n6/4/13 6/4/14 6/4/15\nAU-US Spread AUDUSD\nFIGURE 31.1 AUDUSD vs. 10-Year Yield Spread\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)250against the interest rate differential between Australia and the United States between\n2010 and 2015. There is clearly a positive c orrelation between the 10-year yield\nspread and the currency. Between June 2014 and June 2015, for example, the yield\nspread dropped from 1.5% to 0.5%, and thi s coincided with a drop in the AUDUSD\nfrom 95 to 76 cents.\nMaintaining the Cash Rate: Open Market Operations\nThe focus of daily open market operations is to keep the cash rate close to the target,\nby managing money market liquidity provided to commercial banks. If the Reserve\nBank wishes to decrease the cash rate, it would increase supply of short-dated\nrepurchase agreements at a lower interest rate than the prevailing cash rate, which\nwould in essence decrease the cash rate. If the Reserve Bank wishes to increase\nthe cash rate, it would decrease supply of short-dated repurchase agreements,\nwhich would increase the cash rate. A repurchase agreement involves a cash taker\n(commercial bank) selling securities to a cash provider (RBA), while agreeing to\nrepurchase the securities of the same type and quantity at a later date. This structure\nis similar to a secured loan, whereby the cash taker must pay the cash provider\ninterest. These repo transactions tend to have very short maturities, ranging from\none day to a few weeks.\nAustralia has had a ﬂoating exchange rate since 1983, and the Reserve Bank\nof Australia may undertake foreign exchange market operations when the market\nthreatens to become excessively volatile or when the exchange rate is clearly\ninconsistent with underlying economic fundamentals. The RBA monitors a trade-\nweighted index (TWI), as well as the cross-rate with the U.S. dollar. Intervention\noperations are invariably aimed at stabilizing market conditions rather than meeting\nexchange rate targets.\nMonetary Policy Meetings\nThe RBA meets every month (except for January), on the ﬁrst Tuesday of each\nmonth, to discuss potential changes in monetary policy. Following each meeting, the\nRBA issues a press release outlining justiﬁcations for its monetary policy changes.\nIf it leaves rates unchanged, no statement is published. The RBA also publishes a\nmonthly Reserve Bank Bulletin . The May and November issues of the Reserve Bank\nBulletin include the semiannual statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy. The\nFebruary, May, August, and November issues contain a Quarterly Report on the\nEconomy and Financial Markets. It is important to read these bulletins for signals on\npotential monetary policy changes.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)251Important Characteristics of the Australian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . Historically, the Australian dollar has had a very strongly\ncorrelation (approximately 80%) with commodity prices and, more speciﬁcally,\ngold and iron ore prices. The correlation stems from the fact that Australia is\nthe world’s second largest gold producer and the world’s largest producer of\niron ore. Therefore, the price of iron ore and gold is extremely important to\nAustralia’s economy. However, unless there is a sharp movement in gold or\niron ore prices, it generally takes time for the AUDUSD to adjust to changes in\nthe price of commodities. Generally speaking, if commodity prices are strong,\ninﬂationary fears start to appear, and the RBA would be inclined to raise rates to\ncurb inﬂation. However, this is a sensitive topic, as gold prices tend to increase\nin times of global economic or political uncertainty. If the RBA increases rates\nduring those conditions, it leaves Australia more vulnerable to spillover effects.\n■Carry trade effects . Australia has one of highest interest rates among the developed\ncountries. With a fairly liquid currency, the Australian dollar is one of the most\npopular currencies to use for carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or\nlending a currency with a high interest rate and selling or borrowing a currency\nwith a low interest rate. The popularity of the carry trade has contributed to the\n57% rise of the Australian dollar aga inst the U.S. dolla r between 2001 and 2005.\nWhile the carry trade suffered great ly in 2008, it came back strongly between\n2009 and 2011. During this time, many foreign investors were looking for high\nyield when equity investments offered minimal returns. However, carry trades\nonly last as long as the actual yield advantage remains. If global central banks\nincrease their interest rates and the positive interest rate differential between\nAustralia and other countries narro w, the AUDUSD could s uffer from an exodus\nof carry traders.\n■Drought effects . Since the majority of Australia’s exports are commodities, the\ncountry’s GDP is highly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage\nthe country’s farming activities. For example, 2002 was a particularly difﬁcult\nyear for Australia, because the country was experiencing a severe drought. The\ndrought took an extreme toll on Australia’s farming activities, with dry conditions\nhampering the economy throughout the twenty-ﬁrst century. This is important\nbecause agriculture accounts for 3% of the country’s GDP. The RBA estimates\nthat the ‘‘decline in farm production could directly reduce GDP growth by\naround 1 percentage point.’’ Aside from exporting activities, a drought also has\nindirect effects on other aspects of Australia’s economy. Industries that supply and\nservice agriculture, such as the wholesale and transport sectors, as well as retail\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)252operations in rural farming areas, may also be negatively affected by a drought.\nHowever, it is also important to note that the Australian economy has a history\nof recovering strongly after a drought. The 1982–1983 drought ﬁrst subtracted\nthen subsequently added around 1% to 1 1∕2% to GDP growth. The 1991–1995\ndrought reduced GDP by around 1∕2to3∕4percentage points in 1991–1992 and\n1994–1995, but the recovery boosted GDP by 3∕4percentage points.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of Australia\nand the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries should\nalso be closely watched by Australian dollar traders. These differentials can be\ngood indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much premium\nyield Australian dollar short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, or vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Important Economic Indicators for Australia\nGDP\nGDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of goods and services\nin Australia. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households, businesses,\ngovernment, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used to convert\noutput measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. The data are used\nto gauge where in the business cycle Australia ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often is\nperceived as inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth generally coincides with a\nweak growth period.\nCPI\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a basket\nof goods and services, which account for a high proportion of expenditure by the\nCPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation, and\nhealth. This is an important indicator to watch, as it is a key input for monetary\npolicy decisions.\nBalance of Goods and Services\nThis number is a monthly measure of Australia’s international trade in goods and\nservices on a balance of payments basis. General merchandise imports and exports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)\nk\nk253\nk\nk\nFIGURE 31.2 AUDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (AUD)254are derived mainly from international trade statistics, which are based on Australian\nCustoms Service records. The current account is the balance of trade plus services.\nPrivate Consumption\nThis is a national accounts measure that reﬂects current expenditure by households\nand producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes purchases of\ndurable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure by persons\non the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by unincorporated\nenterprises. This number is important to watch, as private consumption or consumer\nconsumption is the foundation for resilience in the Australian economy.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average\nchanges in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI\ntracks changes in prices for nearly every goods-producing industry in the domestic\neconomy, including agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries,\nmanufacturing, and mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally\nadjusted ﬁnished goods PPI and how the index has reacted on an m/m, q/q, h/h\nand y/y basis. Australia’s PPI data are released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 31.2 illustrates the 10 year performance of AUDUSD.\n255CHAPTER 32\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nNew Zealand Dollar\n(NZD)\n■Broad Economic Overview\nNew Zealand is a very small economy with GDP valued at approximately\nUS$183 billion in 2013. In fact, there are less people living in New Zealand\nthan in New York City. It was once one of the most regulated countries within\nthe OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), but over\nthe past two decades the country has been moving toward a more open, modern,\nand stable economy. With the passing of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1994, the\ncountry is shifting from an agricultural farming community to one that seeks to\nbecome a leading knowledge-based economy with high skills, high employment,\nand high value-added production. This act sets legal standards that hold the govern-\nment formally responsible to the public for its ﬁscal performance. It also sets the\nframework for the country’s macroeconomic policies. The following are the ﬁve\nprinciples outlined under the Fiscal Responsibility Act:\n1. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; by achieving surpluses on the\noperating budget every year until such a level is reached.\n2. Debt must be reduced to ‘‘prudent’’ levels; and the government must ensure\nthat expenditure is lower than revenue.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)2563. Sufﬁcient levels of Crown net worth must be achieved and maintained to guard\nagainst adverse future events.\n4. Reasonable taxation policies must be followed.\n5. Fiscal risks facing the government must be prudently managed.\nNew Zealand also has highly developed manufacturing and services sectors,\nwith the agricultural industry driving the bulk of the country’s exports. The\neconomy is strongly trade-oriented, with exports of goods and services representing\napproximately one third of GDP. Due to the small size of the economy and its\nsigniﬁcant trade activities, New Zealand is highly sensitive to global performance,\nespecially of its key Asian trading partners, Australia, China, United States, and Japan.\nTogether, Australia, China, and Japan represent 42% of New Zealand’s trading\nactivity. It is also extremely sensitive to exchange rate ﬂuctuations, particularly\nagainst the Australian dollar. The fo llowing lists are a breakdown of the New\nZealand’s most important trading partners:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. Australia\n2. China\n3. European Union\n4. United States\n5.

Japan\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy Makers— Reserve\nBank of New Zealand\nMonetary policy in New Zealand is determined by the Reserve Bank (RBNZ).\nThe Monetary Policy Committee is an internal committee of bank executives who\nreview monetary policy on a weekly basis. Meetings to decide on changes to\nmonetary policy occur eight ti mes a year, or approximate ly every six weeks. Unlike\nmost other central banks, the decision for rate changes rests ultimately on the bank’s\ngovernor. The current policy target agreements set by the minister and the governor\nfocus on maintaining policy stability and avoiding unnecessary instability in output,\ninterest rates, and the exchange rate. Price stability refers to maintaining the annual\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)257CPI inﬂation at 1.5%. If the RBNZ does not meet this target, the government has\nthe ability to dismiss the governor of the RBNZ. This is rarely done, but this serves\nas a strong incentive for the RBNZ to meets its inﬂation target. The most common\ntools used by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy changes are the following.\nOfﬁcial Cash Rate (OCR)\nThe Ofﬁcial Cash Rate is the rate set by the RBNZ to implement monetary policy.\nThe Bank lends overnight cash at 25 basis points above the OCR rate and receives\ndeposits or pays interest at 25 basis points below this rate. By controlling the cost\nof liquidity for commercial banks, the RBNZ can inﬂuence the interest rates offered\nto individuals and corporations. This effectively creates a 50 basis point corridor\nthat bounds the interbank overnight rate. The idea is then that banks offering funds\nabove the upper bound will attract few takers, because funds can be borrowed for\na lower cost from the RBNZ. Also, banks offering rates below the lower bound\nwill also attract few takers, because they are offering lower yields than the RBNZ.\nThe ofﬁcial cash rate is reviewed and manipulated with the goal of maintaining\neconomic stability.\nObjectives for Fiscal Policy\nOpen market operations on the other hand are used to meet the cash target. The\ncash target is the targeted amount of reserves held by registered banks. The RBNZ\nprepares forecasts of daily ﬂuctuations on the cash target and will then use these\nforecasts to determine the amount of funds to inject or withdraw in order to meet\nthe cash target. The following government objectives provide a guideline for ﬁscal\nand monetary policy measures:\n■Expenses : Expenses will average around 35% of GDP over the horizon used to\ncalculate contributions toward future New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) costs.\nDuring the buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs, expenses plus contributions\nwill be around 35% of GDP. In the longer term, expenses less withdrawals to\nmeet NZS costs will be around 35% of GDP.\n■Revenue : Raise sufﬁcient revenue to meet the operating balance objective. A\nrobust, broad-based tax system that raises revenue in a fair and efﬁcient way.\n■Operating balance : Operating surplus on average over the economic cycle sufﬁcient\nto meet the requirements for contributions toward future NZS costs and ensure\nconsistency with the debt objective.\n■Debt: Gross debt below 30% of GDP on average over the economic cycle. Net\ndebt, which excludes the assets to meet future NZS costs, below 20% of GDP on\naverage over the economic cycle.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)258■Net worth : Increase net worth consistent with the operating balance objective.\nThis will be achieved through a buildup of assets to meet future NZS costs.\nSource: New Zealand Treasury\n■Important Characteristics of the New Zealand\nDollar\nStrong Correlation with AUD—Competition with Australia\nAustralia is New Zealand’s largest trading partner. This coupled with their geographic\nproximity and New Zealand’s high dependence on trade, creates strong ties between\nthe economies of the two countries. When the Australian economy is healthy and\nAustralian corporations increase their importing activities, New Zealand will be one\nof the ﬁrst to beneﬁt. When it is weak, New Zealand suffers but in recent years\nits sensitivity has diminished because of the country’s growing trade with China\nand other nations. Nonetheless, 22% of trade is still conducted with Australia,\nand this explains why there is a positive correlation between the two currencies.\nFigure 32.1 shows how closely AUDUS D and NZDUSD have moved between 2005\nand 2015.\nCommodity-Linked Currency\nNew Zealand is an export driven economy with commodities representing over\n40% of the country’s exports, and as a result the New Zealand dollar has a strong\ncorrelation with commodity prices, particularly dairy. Fonterra is one of the world’s\n1. 2\n1. 1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.4AUDUSD vs. NZDUSD\n6/30/05 6/30/06 6/30/07 6/30/08 6/30/09 6/30/10 6/30/11 6/30/12 6/30/13 6/30/140.5\nAUDUSD NZDUSD\nFIGURE 32.1 AUDUSD versus NZDUSD\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)259leading dairy producer and also largest company in New Zealand. Twice a month\nthe Global Dairy Trade will conduct an auction and if prices rise, it will be positive\nfor the New Zealand dollar. If prices fall, it will be negative for the currency\nbecause it can mean reduced payout and proﬁt for dairy producers. The correlation\nbetween Australian and New Zealand dollars also contributes to the NZD’s status as a\n‘‘commodity linked’’ currency. Therefore, the New Zealand dollar’s correlation with\ncommodity prices is not only limited to its own trade activities. Therefore, as com-\nmodity prices increase, the Australian economy beneﬁts, translating into increased\nactivity in all aspects of the country’s operations, including trade with New Zealand.\nCarry Trades\nOf the industrialized countries, New Zealand tends to maintain the highest interest\nrate as it needs to offer investors a higher yield to compensate for the risk of\ninvesting in a small economy. This yield advantage along with its secure credit rating\nhas made the New Zealand dollar one of the most popular currencies to purchase\nfor carry trades. A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. The\npopularity of the carry trade has contributed to the rise of the New Zealand dollar in\nan environment where many global investors are looking for opportunities to earn\nhigh yield. However, this also makes the New Zealand dollar particularly sensitive\nto changes in interest rates. That is, when the United States begins increasing their\ninterest rates, while New Zealand stays on hold or reduces their interest rates, the\ncarry advantage of the New Zealand dollar would narrow. In such situations, the\nNew Zealand dollar could come under pressure as speculators reverse their carry\ntrade positions.\nInterest Rate Differentials\nInterest rate differentials between the cash rates of New Zealand and the short\nterm interest rate yields of other industrialized countries are closely watched by\nprofessional NZD traders. These differentials can be good indicators of potential\nmoney ﬂows as they indicate how much premium yield NZD short-term ﬁxed-\nincome assets are offering over foreign short-term ﬁxed income assets, or vice versa.\nThis differential provides traders with indications of potential currency movements,\nas investors are always looking for assets with the highest yields. This is particularly\nimportant to carry traders who enter and exit their positions based on the positive\ninterest rate differentials between global ﬁxed-income assets.\nPopulation Migration\nAs mentioned earlier, New Zealand has a very small population, less than half of\nNew York City. Therefore, changes in migration can have signiﬁcant effects on the\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)260economy. Between 2013 an d 2014, the population of New Zealand increased by\n78,800 people, which was the largest net migration in at least 90 years. Between\n2011 and 2012, for example, the population only grew by 26,400 people. Although\nthese absolute numbers appear small, it is fairly signiﬁcant for New Zealand because\nof the size of the population. In fact, this strong population migration into New\nZealand has contributed signiﬁcantly to the performance of the economy, because\nas the population increases, the demand for household goods increases, leading to\nan increase in overall consumer consumption.\nDrought Effects\nSince the bulk of New Zealand’s exports are commodities, the country’s GDP is\nhighly sensitive to severe weather conditions that may damage the country’s farming\nactivities. In 2013, droughts cost the country over $1.3 billion. In addition, droughts\nare also very frequent in Australia, New Zealand’s largest trading partner, and when\nthey occur it can have a negative impact on the New Zealand economy.\n■Important Economic Indicators for New Zealand\nNew Zealand does not release economic indicators often; however, when they do,\nthe following items are the most important:\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP is a quarterly measure of the total production and consumption of goods and\nservices in New Zealand. GDP is measured by adding expenditures by households,\nbusinesses, government, and net foreign purchases. The GDP price deﬂator is used\nto convert output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. This data are\nused to gauge where in the business cycle New Zealand ﬁnds itself. Fast growth often\nis perceived inﬂationary, while low (or negative) growth indicates a recessionary or\nweak growth period.\nConsumer Price Index\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures quarterly changes in the price of a\n‘‘basket’’ of goods and services that account for a high proportion of expenditure by\nthe CPI population group (i.e., metropolitan households). This basket covers a wide\nrange of goods and services, including food, housing, education, transportation,\nand health. This is an important indicator to watch, as monetary policy changes are\nhighly inﬂuenced by this index as it is a measure of inﬂation.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)\nk\nk261\nk\nk\nFIGURE 32.2 NZDUSD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nCURRENCY PROFILE: NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD)262Balance of Goods and Services\nNew Zealand’s Balance of Payments statements are records of the value of New\nZealand’s transactions in goods, services, income, and transfers with the rest of the\nworld, and the changes in New Zealand’s ﬁnancial claims on (assets), and liabilities\nto, the rest of the world. New Zealand’s International Investment Position statement\nshows, at a particular point in time, the stock of a country’s international ﬁnancial\nassets and international ﬁnancial liabilities.\nRetail Sales Ex Inﬂation\nCredit card spending numbers are released for New Zealand on a monthly basis but\nthe retail sales data is quarterly on an ex inﬂation basis. This measure tracks the\nresale of new and used goods to the public for personal or household consumption.\nIt is also an important input into GDP.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a m/m, q/q, h/h, and y/y basis. New\nZealand’s PPI data is released on a quarterly basis.\nFigure 32.2 illustrates the 10-year performance of NZDUSD.\n263CHAPTER 33\nCurrency Proﬁle:\nCanadian Dollar\n(CAD)\n■Broad Economic Performance\nCanada is the world’s eleventh largest country with GDP valued at US$1.8 trillion as\nof 2014. As a resource-based economy, the country’s early economic development\nhinged on the development, exploitation, and exports of natural resources. It is\nnow the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold. However, in actuality,\nnearly two-thirds of the country’s GDP comes from the service sector, which also\nemploys three out of four Canadians. The strength in the service sector is partly\nattributed to the trend by businesses to subcontract a large portion of their services.\nThis may include a manufacturing company subcontracting delivery services to a\ntransportation company. Despite this, manufacturing and resources are still very\nimportant for the Canadian economy, as it represents over 25% of the country’s\nexports and is a primary source of income for a number of provinces.\nThe Canadian economy started to advance with the depreciation of its currency\nagainst the U.S. dollar and the Free Trade Agreement that came into effect in January\n1989. This agreement eliminated almost all trade tariffs between the United States\nand Canada. As a result, Canada now exports over 85% of its goods to the United\nStates. Further negotiations to incorporate Mexico created the North American Free\nTrade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect on January 1994. This more advanced\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)264treaty eliminated most tariffs on trading b etween all three countries. Canada’s close\ntrade relationship with the United States makes it particularly sensitive to the health\nof the U.S. economy. If the U.S. economy sputters, demand for Canadian exports\nwould suffer. The same is true for the opposite scenario; if U.S. economic growth\nis robust, Canadian exports will beneﬁt. In the past decade, trade with China has\nalso increased signiﬁcantly, rising in the ranks from the ﬁfth to the second most\nimportant trade partner for Canada. The following is a breakdown of Canada’s key\nexport and import markets:\nLeading Export Markets\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. United Kingdom\n4. Japan\n5. Mexico\nLeading Import Sources\n1. United States\n2. China\n3. Japan\n4. Mexico\n5. United Kingdom\n■Monetary and Fiscal Policy\nThe Governing Council of the Bank of Canada is the board that is responsible for\nsetting Canadian monetary policy. This council consists of seven members: the\ngovernor and six deputy governors. The Bank of Canada meets approximately eight\ntimes per year to discuss changes in monetary policy. They also release a monthly\nmonetary policy update every quarter, but the rate decision itself is the big market\nmover for the currency.\nCentral Bank Goals\nThe Bank of Canada’s primary focus is on maintaining the ‘‘integrity and value of\nthe currency,’’ and this involves ensuring pri ce stability. Price stability is maintained\nby adhering to an inﬂation target currently set by the Department of Finance at\n1% to 3%. The Bank believes that high inﬂation can damage the functioning of the\neconomy. In their opinion, low inﬂation on the other hand equates to price stability,\nwhich can help to foster sustainable long-term economic growth. The BoC controls\ninﬂation through short-term interest rates. If inﬂation is above the target, the Bank\nwill apply tighter monetary conditions. If it is below the target, the Bank will loosen\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)265monetary policy. Overall, the central bank has done a pretty good job of keeping\nthe inﬂation target within the band since 1998.\nThe Bank measures monetary conditions using its Monetary Conditions Index,\nwhich is a weighted sum of changes in the 90-day commercial paper rate and G-10\ntrade-weighted exchange rates. The weight of the interest rate versus the exchange\nrate is 3 to 1, which is the affect of a chan ge in interest rates on the exchange rate\nbased on historical studies. This means that a 1% increase in short-term interest\nrates is the same as a 3% appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate. To\nchange monetary policy, the BoC manipulates the Bank Rate, which can in turn\naffect the exchange rate. If the currency appreciates to undesirable levels, the BoC\ncan decrease interest rates to offset the rise. If it depreciates, the BoC can raise rates.\nHowever, interest rate changes are not used for the purposes of manipulating the\nexchange rate. Instead, they are used to control inﬂation but an excessively strong\ncurrency and lower inﬂationary pressures can accelerate the changes. The following\nare the most commonly used tools by the BoC to implement monetary policy.\nBank Rate\nThe Bank Rate is the main rate used to control inﬂation. This is the rate of interest\nthat the Bank of Canada charges to commercial banks. Changes to this rate will affect\nother interest rates, including mortgage rates and prime rates charged by commercial\nbanks. Therefore, changes to this rate will ﬁlter into the overall economy.\nOpen Market Operations\nThe Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) is the framework for the Bank of Canada’s\nimplementation of monetary policy. It is through this framework that Canada’s\ncommercial banks borrow and lend overnight money to each other in order to fund\ntheir daily transactions. The LVTS is an electronic platform through which these\nﬁnancial institutions conduct large transactions. The interest rate charged on these\novernight loans is called the overnight rate or bank rate. The BoC can manipulate the\novernight rate by offering to lend at rates lower or higher than the current market\nrate if the overnight lending rate is trading above or below the target banks.\nOn a regular basis, the bank releases a number of publications that are important to\nfollow. This includes a biannual Monetary Policy Report that contains an assessment of\nthe current economic environment and implications for inﬂation and a quarterly Bank\nof Canada Review that includes economic commentary, featured articles, speeches by\nmembers of the Governing Council, and important announcements.\nImportant Characteristics of the Canadian Dollar\n■Commodity linked currency . As the world’s ﬁfth largest producer of oil and gold,\nCanada’s economy is highly dependent on commodities. This creates a strong\npositive correlation between the Canadian dollar and oil prices. Generally\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)266speaking, when oil prices rise, it beneﬁts domestic producers and increases their\nincome from exports. However at the same time, strong commodity prices can\nhurt growth abroad; so while rising oil prices are initially positive for Canada,\nthe negative impact on global growth could lead to a decline in demand over the\nmedium term. On the ﬂip side, falling oil prices are negative for the Canadian\ndollar; but if prices remain low and global growth beneﬁts, it can eventually\nneutralize the negative impact.\n■Strong correlation with the United States . Since the 1980s, Canada has been running\nmerchandise trade surpluses with the United States and now approximately 77%\nof Canadian exports are bound for the Untied States. This heavy reliance on U.S.,\ndemand makes Canada extremely sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy. As the\nU.S. economy accelerates, trade increases with Canadian companies, lifting overall\neconomic activity. However, as the U.S. economy slows, the Canadian economy\nwill be hurt signiﬁcantly as U.S. companies reduce their importing activities.\n■Mergers and acquisitions . Due to the proximity of the United States and Canada,\ncross-border mergers and acquisitions are very common, as companies worldwide\nstrive for globalization. These mergers and acquisitions lead to money ﬂowing\nbetween the two countries, which ulti mately impacts the currencies. In 2001,\nthe signiﬁcant U.S. acquisition of Canadian energy companies infused US$25\nbillion into Canada. This led to a strong rally in USDCAD, as the U.S. companies\nneeded to sell USD and buy CAD to pay for their acquisitions. Any similar type\nof M&A ﬂow in the future will also have a signiﬁcant but short-term impact on\nthe Canadian dollar.\n■Interest rate differentials . Interest rate differentials between the cash rates of\nCanada and the short-term interest rate yields of other industrialized countries\nare closely watched by professional Canadian dollar traders. These differentials\ncan be good indicators of potential money ﬂows as they indicate how much\npremium yield Canadian short-term ﬁxed-income assets are offering over foreign\nshort-term ﬁxed-income assets, and vice versa. This differential provides traders\nwith indications of potential currency movements, as investors are always looking\nfor assets with the highest yields. This is particularly important to carry traders\nwho enter and exit their positions based on the positive interest rate differentials\nbetween global ﬁxed-income assets.\n■Carry trades . A carry trade involves buying or lending a currency with a high\ninterest rate and selling or borrowing a currency with a low interest rate. When\nCanada has a higher interest rate than th e United States, the short USDCAD carry\ntrade becomes more attractive; but if th e United States emba rks on a tightening\ncampaign or Canada lowers rates, the positive interest rate differential between\nthe Canadian dollar and other currencies would narrow. In such situations, the\nCanadian dollar could come under pressure if the speculators begin to exit out of\ntheir carry trades.\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)267■Important Economic Indicators for Canada\nCanadian economic reports can have a signiﬁcant impact on the currency. Here are\na handful of the most important releases.\nCanadian Employment\nEvery month, Canada releases its labor market report and this report provides more\ndetails than that of the United States. Job growth is expressed as net job growth and\nthen split into full- and part-time hirers. Generally speaking, the market prefers that\nthe bulk of job growth is full time, because it represents real long-term employment\nand not short-term hires that can be laid off at any time. The unemployment rate is\nalso released, and the number of unemployed persons is expressed as a percentage\nof the labor force.\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\nThe monthly consumer price report measures the average rate of increase in prices.\nWhen economists speak of inﬂation as an economic problem, they generally mean\na persistent increase in the general price level over a period of time, resulting in a\ndecline in a currency’s purchasing power. Inﬂation is often measured as a percentage\nincrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Canada’s inﬂation policy, as set out\nby the federal government and the Bank of Canada, aims to keep inﬂation within\na target range of 1% to 3%. If the rate of inﬂation is 10% a year, $100 worth of\npurchases last year will, on average, cost $110 this year. At the same inﬂation rate,\nthose purchases will cost $121 next year, and so on.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nThe gross domestic product measures the total value of all goods and services\nproduced within Canada during a given year. It is a measure of the income generated\nby production within Canada. GDP is also referred to as economic output. To\navoid counting the same output more than once, GDP includes only ﬁnal goods\nand services—not those that are used to make another product. For example, GDP\nwould not include the wheat used to make bread, but would include the bread itself.\nTrade Balance\nThe balance of trade is a statement of a country’s trade in goods (merchandise) and\nservices. It covers trade in products such as manufactured goods, raw materials, and\nagricultural goods, as well as travel and transportation. The balance of trade is the\ndifference between the value of the goods and services that a country exports and\nthe value of the goods and services that it imports. If a country’s exports exceed its\nimports, it has a trade surplus and the trade balance is said to be positive. If imports\nCURRENCY PROFILE: CANADIAN DOLLAR (CAD)268\nFIGURE 33.1 USDCAD 10-Year Chart\nSource: eSignal\nexceed exports, the country has a trade deﬁcit, and its trade balance is said to be\nnegative.\nRetail Sales\nRetail sales is a monthly national accounts measure that calculates current expenditure\nby households and producers of private nonproﬁt services to households. It includes\npurchases of durable as well as nondurable goods. However, it excludes expenditure\nby persons on the purchase of dwellings and expenditure of a capital nature by\nunincorporated enterprises. Stronger consumer spending is positive for Canada’s\neconomy and, in turn, the Canadian dollar, whereas weaker consumer spending is\nnegative for Canada’s economy and currency.\nProducer Price Index\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures average changes\nin selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The PPI tracks\nchanges in prices for nearly every goods producing industry in the domestic economy,\nincluding agriculture, electricity and natural gas, forestry, ﬁsheries, manufacturing,\nand mining. Foreign exchange markets tend to focus on seasonally adjusted ﬁnished\ngoods PPI and how the index has reacted on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.\nFigure 33.1 illustrates the 10-year

        "53CHAPTER 4\nA Deeper Look\nat the FX Market\nThe next three chapters cover some of the unique studies that I have done on the\nFX market that provide some telling details for both the novice and advanced\ntrader. This includes the following:\n1. What are the best times to trade for individual currency pairs?\n2. What are the most market moving economic data?\n3. What are currency correlations, and how can we use them?\n■What Are the Best Times to Trade for Individual\nCurrency Pairs?\nThe Foreign Exchange market operates 24 hours a day, making it nearly impossible\nfor a single trader to track every market movement and respond immediately at all\ntimes. Timing is everything in currency trading. In order to devise an effective and\ntime-efﬁcient investment strategy, it is important to understand how much liquidity\nthere is around the clock to maximize the number of trading opportunities during a\ntrader’s own market hours. Besides liquidity, a currency pair’s trading range is also\nheavily dependent on geographical location and macroeconomic factors. Knowing\nwhat time of day a currency pair has the widest or narrowest trading range will\nundoubtedly help traders improve their investment utility due to better capital\nallocation. This section outlines the typical trading activity of major currency pairs\nin different time zones to see when they are the most volatile. Figure 4.1 tabulates\nA DEEPER LOOK AT THE FX MARKET54\nCurrencyAsian\nSessionEuropean\nSessionU.S.\nSession EuropeU.S.-Europe\nOverlapEurope-Asian\nOverlap\nPairs 7pm-4am 2am-12pm 8am-5pm 3am-12pm 8am-12pm 2am-4am\nEURUSD 51 87 78 84 65 32\nUSDJPY 78 79 69 77 58 29\nGBPUSD 65 112 94 109 78 43\nUSDCHF 68 117 107 114 88 43\nEURCHF 53 53 49 52 40 24\nAUDUSD 38 53 47 51 39 20\nUSDCAD 47 94 84 93 74 28\nNZDUSD 42 52 46 50 38 20\nEURGBP 25 40 34 39 27 16\nGBPJPY 112 145 119 140 99 60\nGBPCHF 96 150 129 146 105 62\nAUDJPY 55 63 56 62 47 26\nFIGURE 4.1 Currency Pair Ranges\nthe average pip range for the different currency pairs during various time frames\nbetween 2013 and 2014.\nThe FX market is broken into three primary trading sessions.\nAsian Session (Tokyo): 7pm to 4am EST\nTrading begins on Sunday in Asia at 5pm NY Time, but the Tokyo session begins\naround 7pm NY Time. During the Asian trading session, the largest volume is\ntransacted in Tokyo, followed by Hong Kong and Singapore. Trading in Tokyo can\nbe thin from time to time; but large investment banks and hedge funds are known to\ntry to use the Asian session to run important stop and option barrier levels, especially\nduring Sunday trade. Figure 4.2 provides a ranking of the different currency pairs\nand their ranges during the Asian trading session.\nMore risk-tolerant traders may choose to trade USDJPY, GBPCHF, and GBPJPY\nbecause their broad ranges provide short-term traders with lucrative proﬁt potentials,\nwith an average daily range of 90 pips. Foreign investment banks and institutional\ninvestors who hold mostly dollar-dominated assets also contribute to the daily ﬂow\nin USDJPY through their Japanese equity and bond markets transactions. The Bank\nof Japan, who holds over $1.2 trillion of U.S. Treasury debt, is an active player with\ntheir open market operations impacting the value of the currency. Last but not least,\nlarge Japanese exporters may choose to repatriate their foreign earnings during the\nTokyo trading session, adding to the ﬂuctuations of the currency pair. A pair like\nGBPJPY is especially volatile because large market participants may start to scale\ninto or out of positions ahead of the European market open.\nA DEEPER LOOK AT THE FX MARKET55120\n100\n80\n60Range between daily highs and lows (pips)\nCurrency PairsVolatility: Asian Session\nEURGBP AUDUSD NZDUSD USDCAD EURUSD EURCHF AUDJPY GBPUSD USDCHF USDJPY GBPCHF GBPJPY40\n20\n0\nFIGURE 4.2 Asian Session Volatility\nMore risk-averse participants may prefer to trade EURGBP, AUDUSD or\nNZDUSD because they generally have less volatility, which can help to shield\ntraders and their investment strategies from irregular market movements caused by\naggressive intraday speculation.\nU.S. Session (New York): 8am to 5pm EST\nAccording to the Bank of International Settlements’ 2013 Triennial Central Bank\nSurvey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity, New York is the\nsecond largest FX marketplace, accounting for 19% of total forex market volume.\nThe majority of the transactions during the U.S. session are executed between 8am\nto 12pm NY Time, a period with high liquidity because the European and U.S.\nmarkets overlap. After 12pm, trading starts to wind down with ranges narrowing\nuntil the open of the Tokyo session. There can be some range expansions right\nbefore the U.S. equity market closes but generally speaking the volatility is far less\nthan in the 8am to 12pm time period.\nMore risk-tolerant traders will ﬁnd GBPUSD, USDCHF, GBPJPY, and GBPCHF\nattractive currency pairs to day trade because their daily ranges average around 120\npips (Figure 4.3). Trading in these currency pairs is particularly active because they\ninvolve the U.S. dollar. When the U.S. equity and bond markets are open during\nthe U.S. session, foreign investors have to convert their domestic currency, such\nas the euro, Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc into dollar-dominated assets in order\nto carry out their transactions. With the market overlap, GBPJPY and GBPCHF have\nthe widest daily ranges.

In AUDCAD for\nexample, for an Australian dollar to be converted into Canadian dollars, it usually\nhas to be traded against the USD ﬁrst, then CAD. This means an AUDCAD trade\ntypically involves two different currency transactions, AUDUSD and USDCAD,\nand its volatility is ultima tely determined by the correlations of the two derived\ncurrency pairs. Since AUDUSD and USDCAD are negatively correlated, which\nmeans they tend to move in opposite directions, the volatility of AUDCAD is\nampliﬁed. Trading currency pairs with high volatility can be very lucrative, but in\ndoing it is also important to bear in mind that the risk involved can also be high.\nTraders should continuously evaluate their strategies as market conditions change\nbecause big moves in exchange rates can easily nullify their long-term strategies.\nFor the more risk-averse traders, USDJPY, EURUSD, and USDCAD can be\nattractive pairs because they offer a dece nt trading range with lower risk. The highly\nliquid nature of these currency pairs can also allow investor to secure proﬁts or\ncut losses promptly and efﬁciently. The modest volatility of these pairs provides a\nfavorable environment for traders who want to pursue long-term strategies.\nEuropean Session (London): 3am to 12pm EST\nLondon is the largest and most important dealing center in the world, with a market\nshare of more than 40% according to the BIS survey.

Half of the 12 major pairs surpass the\n80 pips line, the benchmark that we used to identify volatile pairs from the rest,\nwith GBPJPY and GBPCHF reaching as high as 140 pips and 146 pips, respectively,\nduring this time period (Figure 4.4).\nWith an average daily range of more than 140 pips, GBPJPY and GBPCHF are\ntwo currency pairs that risk-tolerant traders love to trade. While such high volatility\ncan create much in the way of opportunity, it is important to realize that the\npeak of daily trade activity in these two pairs generally happens during the London\nsession. With the London trading session overlapping both the New York and Tokyo\nsessions, it is the perfect market for banks and institutional investors to reposition\ntheir portfolios, and these adjustments contribute to the volatility in the market.\nTraders with moderate risk proﬁles will also ﬁnd plenty of pairs to choose from.\nEURUSD, USDCAD, GBPUSD, and USDCHF have an average range of 100 pips. As\nmentioned earlier, trading in these pairs is active because large market participants\nlike to adjust their portfolios before the U.S. session opens.\nFor the more risk-averse, the NZDUSD, AUDUSD, EURCHF, and AUDJPY,\nwith an average of 50 pips range, are good choices as these pairs provide traders with\nhigh interest income and proﬁt potential. These pairs allow investors to determine\ntheir direction of movements based on fundamental economic factors and tend to\nbe less prone to losses caused by intraday speculative trades.\nA DEEPER LOOK AT THE FX MARKET58EURGBP NZDUSD AUDUSD EURCHF EURUSD USDJPY EURUSD USDCAD GBPUSD USDCHF GBPJPY GBPCHF\nCurrency PairsVolatility: U.S.–Europe Overlap\n120\n100\n80\n60Range between daily highs and lows (pips)40\n20\n0\nFIGURE 4.5 U.S.–Europe Overlap\nEURGBP NZDUSD AUDUSD AUDJPY USDCAD USDJPY EURUSD GBPUSD USDCHF GBPJPY GBPCHF EURCHF\nCurrency PairsVolatility: Europe–Asian Overlap\n70\n60\n50\n40Range between daily highs and lows (pips)30\n20\n10\n0\nFIGURE 4.6 Europe–Asia Overlap\nUS–Europe Overlap: 8am to 12pm EST\nThe FX markets tend to be most active when the hours of the world’s two largest\ntrading centers overlap.

        "129CHAPTER 13\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Fader\nMore often than not, traders will ﬁnd themselves faced with a potential breakout\nscenario, position for it, and then only end up seeing the trade fail miserably\nand have prices revert back to range trading. In fact, even if prices manage to break\nabove a signiﬁcant level, a continuation move is not guaranteed. If this level is\nvery signiﬁcant, we frequently see interbank dealers or other traders try to push\nprices beyond those levels momentarily in order to run stops. Breakout levels are\nvery signiﬁcant levels and for this very reason, there is no hard fast rule as to\nhow much force is needed to carry prices beyond levels into a sustainable trend.\nTrading breakouts at key levels can involve a lot of risk and as a result, false\nbreakouts appear more frequently than real breakouts. Sometimes prices will test\nthe resistance level once, twice, or even three times before breaking out. This\nhas fostered the development of a large degree of contra-trend traders who look\nonly to fade breakouts in the currency markets. Yet fading every breakout can also\nresult in some signiﬁcant losses because once a real breakout occurs, the trend is\ngenerally strong and long-lasting. So what this boils down to is that traders need a\nmethodology for screening out consolidation patterns for trades that have a higher\npotential of resulting in a false breakout. The following rules provide a good basis\nfor screening such trades. The fader strate gy is a variation of the ‘‘waiting for the\nreal deal’’ strategy. It uses the daily charts to identify the range-bound environment\nand the hourly charts to pinpoint entry levels.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADER130■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Locate a currency pair whose 14-day ADX is less than 20. Ideally, the ADX\nshould also be trending downward, indicating that the trend is weakening\nfurther\n2. Wait for the market to break below the previous day’s low by at least 15 pips.\n3. Place an entry order to buy a few ticks above the previous day’s high.\n4. After getting ﬁlled, place your initial stop no more than 20 pips away.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of position when prices increase by the amount you risked;\nmove stop on remaining position to breakeven.\n6. Trail the stop on the remaining position.\nShorts:\n1. Locate a currency pair whose 14-day ADX is less than 20. Ideally the ADX\nshould also be trending downward, indicating that the trend is weakening\nfurther\n2. Look for a move above the previous day’s high by at least 15 pips.\n3. Place an entry order to sell a few ticks below the previous day’s low.\n4. Once ﬁlled, place the initial protective stop no more than 20-pips below your\nentry.\n5. Protect any proﬁts by selling half of the position when it runs 20 pips in your\nfavor.\n6. Place a trailing stop on the remainder of the position.\nExamples\nLet’s start by taking a look at an example to the short side. Figure 13.1 shows a\ndaily chart of USDJPY with the ADX below 20 and pointing downward. This is the\nﬁrst signal that a trade setup is in place. In this example, the previous day’s high\nis 120.27. We ﬁrst look for a move above the previous day’s high by at least 15\npips, or 120.42. As shown in Figure 13.2 the hourly chart, that move occurs at the\nstart of the European session after which we place an order to sell 5 pips below the\nprevious day’s low of 120.00. The order is ﬁlled a few hours later at 119.95. At the\ntime, we place our stop at 120.15 and a ﬁrst target of 119.75. The ﬁrst target is\nreached, and the stop on the rest of the position is moved to breakeven or 119.95.\nIn this example, the second half of the trade remains live and will either be closed at\nbreakeven, or the stop will be trailed.\nNow let’s take a look at an example to the long side. Figure 13.3 shows a daily\nchart of EURUSD with the ADX below 20 and pointing downward. This is the\nﬁrst signal that a trade setup is in place. In this example, the previous day’s high is\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADER131\nFIGURE 13.1 USDJPY Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 13.2 USDJPY 60-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADER132\nFIGURE 13.3 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 13.4 EURUSD 60-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: FADER1331.0801, and the low is 1.0708. We see that the low is broken ﬁrst, and when that\nhappens we place an order to buy 5 pips above the previous days high at 1.0806.\nAs shown in Figure 13.4, the order is triggered about 7 hours later. At the time,\nwe place our stop at 1.0786 and a ﬁrst target of 1.0826. The ﬁrst target is reached\nshortly after, and the stop on the rest of the position is moved to breakeven, or\n1.0806. In this example, if we trail the stop on the position using a two-bar low, the\nsecond half of the trade is closed at 1.0818.\nFurther Optimization\nThe false breakout strategy works best when there are no signiﬁcant economic\nreports scheduled for release that could trigger sharp unexpected movements.\nFor example, prices often consolidate ahead of the U.S. nonfarm payrolls release.\nGenerally speaking, they are consolidating for a reason, and that reason is because\nthe market is undecided and is either positioned already or wants to wait to react\nfollowing that release. Either way, there is a higher likelihood that any breakout on\nthe back of those releases would be a real one and not one that you want to fade.\nThis strategy works best with currency pairs that are less volatile and have narrower\ntrading ranges."

        "135CHAPTER 14\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: 20-Day\nBreakout Trade\nTrading breakouts can be both a rewarding and frustrating endeavor as breakouts\nhave a tendency to fail. A major reason why this can occur frequently in the\nforeign exchange market is because it is more technically driven than others and as a\nresult, there are many market participants who intentionally look to break pairs out\nin order to ‘‘suck’’ in other nonsuspecting traders. In an effort to ﬁlter out potential\nfalse breakouts, a price action screener should be used to identify breakouts that\nhave a higher probability of success. The rules behind this strategy are speciﬁcally\ndeveloped to take advantage of strong trending markets that make new highs that\nthen proceed to ‘‘fail’’ by taking out a recent low and then reverse again to make\nanother new high. This type of setup tends to have a very high success rate as it\nallows traders to enter strong trending markets after weaker players have been\nﬂushed out, only to have real money players reenter the market and push the pair\nup to new highs.\n■Strategy Rules\nLongs:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day high.\n2. Look for the pair to reverse the same day or next to make a two-day low.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE1363. Buy the pair if it takes out the 20-day high within three days of making the\ntwo-day low.\n4. Place the initial stop a few pips below the two-day low.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nShorts:\n1. Look for a currency pair that is making a 20-day low.\n2. That day or the next the pair rallies to make a two-day high.\n3. Sell the pair if it trades below the 20-day low within three days of making the\ntwo-day high.\n4. Risk up to a few ticks above the two-day high.\n5. Take proﬁt on half of the position when it moves by the amount risked; move\nstop on rest to breakeven.\n6. Trail stop on the remainder of the position.\nExamples\nNow take a look at our ﬁrst example in Figure 14.1. The daily chart of GBPUSD\nshows the currency pair making a new 20-day high on February 5. At this point,\nthe currency pair is on our radar, and we watch for a new two-day low to be made\nFIGURE 14.1 GBPUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE137within the next three days. This occurs right on schedule after which we wait for\nthe currency pair to make a new 20-day high, which occurs on February 12. At the\ntime, we buy GBPUSD a few pips above the previous 20-day high of 1.5352. We\nenter at 1.5360. The stop is placed a few pips below the original two-day low of\n1.5197 (or 1.5190). As the currency pair moves in our favor, we look to exit half\nof the position when it moves by the amount that we risked, which is 155 pips or\n1.5507. The stop on the remainder of the position is moved to breakeven or the\ninitial entry price of 1.5352. This rest of the trade is exited 24 hours later.\nFigure 14.2 provides an example of how the strategy can work in the EURUSD\nto the short side. On December 23, the currency pair makes a new 20-day low of\n1.2165. It goes on radar and we start looking for the currency pair to rebound within\nthe next three days. The recovery occurs the following day, and a new two-day\nhigh is made. Then we look for the previous 20-day low to be broken within the\nfollowing three days and that occurs shortly thereafter. At which point we enter\na short EURUSD trade at 1.2155 with a stop at 1.2260, or a few pips above the\ntwo-day high of 1.2254. Our risk on the trade is 105 pips. When the currency pair\ndrops to 1.2050, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. Then we trail the stop using a 2-bar high and end up exiting the\nremainder of the position at 1.1846.\nThe ﬁnal example shown in Figure 14.3 is in AUDUSD. The currency starts by\nmaking a new 20-day low on January 26. It goes on radar and we start looking\nfor the currency pair to rebound within the next three days. The recovery occurs\nFIGURE 14.2 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: 20-DAY BREAKOUT TRADE138\nFIGURE 14.3 AUDUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nintraday, and a new two-day high is made right on schedule. Then we look for the\nprevious 20-day low to be broken within the following three days it occurs 24 hours\nafter the two-day high is made. At which point we enter a short AUDUSD trade a\nfew pips below the 20-day low at 0.7850 with a stop at 0.8032, or a few pips above\nthe two-day high of 0.8025. Our risk on the trade is 182 pips. When the currency\npair drops to 0.7668, we exit the ﬁrst half of the position and move the stop on the\nrest to breakeven. The breakeven stop is triggered the very same day that the ﬁrst\ntarget is reached.\n139CHAPTER 15\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Channels\nChannel trading is a less exotic but popular trading technique for currencies. The\nreason why it can work is because currencies rarely spend much time in tight\ntrading ranges and have the tendency to develop strong trends. By reviewing a few\ncharts, traders can see that channels can easily be identiﬁed and occur frequently.\nA common scenario would be channel trading during the Asian session and a\nbreakout in either the London or U.S. session. There are many instances where\neconomic releases are one of the most common triggers for a break of the channel.\nTherefore, it is imperative that traders keep on top of economic releases. If a channel\nhas formed and a big U.S. number (per say) is expected to be released, and the\ncurrency pair is at the top of a channel, the probability of a break is high, so traders\nshould be looking to buy the break out, not fade it.\nChannels are created when we draw a trendline, and then draw a line that is\nparallel to that trendline. Most if not all of the price activity of the currency pair\nshould fall between the two channel lines. We will seek to identify situations where\nthe price is trading within a narrow channel, and then trade in the direction of a\nbreakout from the channel. This strategy can be particularly effective when used\nprior to a fundamental market event such as the release of major economic news, or\nprior to the ‘‘open’’ of a major ﬁnancial market.\nHere are some rules for using this technique to ﬁnd long trades:\n1. First, identify a channel on either an intraday or daily chart. The price should\nbe contained within a narrow range.\n2. Enter long as the price breaks above the upper channel line by 10 pips.\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS1403. Place a stop at the lower channel line.\n4. Exit the position when it moves by double the amount risked.\nThe short rules are the reverse.\n■Examples\nLet examine a few examples. The ﬁrst example is a USDCAD 15-minute chart\nshown in Figure 15.1. The total range of the channel is approximately 30 pips with\nthe low being 1.2028 and the high 1.2056. In accordance with our strategy, we\nplace entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at 1.2018 and 1.2066. The\norder to buy gets triggered ﬁrst, and almost immediately we place a stop order\nat the low of the channel or 1.2028, which means we are risking 38 pips on the\ntrade. USDCAD then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of double the range at\n1.2142. More conservative traders could exit half of the position when it moves by\nthe amount risked, or 38 pips, and trail the stop on the remainder of the position.\nThe next example shown in Figure 15.2 is a 15-minute chart of EURGBP. The\ntotal range between the two lines is 12 p ips with the low being 0.7148 and the high\n0.7160. In accordance with our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and\nbelow the channel at 0.7138 and 0.7170. The order to buy gets triggered ﬁrst and\nalmost immediately we place a stop at the low of the channel or 0.7160 for 10-pip\nrisk. EURGBP then proceeds to rally and reaches our target of 20 pips or double\nthe amount risked.\nFIGURE 15.1 USDCAD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS141\nFIGURE 15.2 EURGBP 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 15.3 EURUSD 15-Minute Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFigure 15.3 is a 15-minute chart of the EURUSD. The total range during this\nfour-hour period is 18 pips with a high of 1.1206 and a low of 1.1188. In accordance\nwith our strategy, we place entry orders 10 pips above and below the channel at\n1.1216 and 1.1178. The order to sell gets triggered ﬁrst and almost immediately,\nwe place a stop order at the channel high of 1.1206 for a risk of 28 pips. The\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: CHANNELS142EURUSD then proceeds to sell off signiﬁcantly but only makes it to a low of 1.1132\nbefore stopping us out a few days later. We chose to show this example because it\nexplains why the more conservative approach of exiting half of the position when it\nmoves by the amount risk is more desirable, even though it has worse risk reward.\nA move of 58 pips is sizable on an intraday basis and may be difﬁcult to achieve.\nWhenever the risk is greater than 20 pips, it may be more prudent to exit half and\ntrail the stop.\n143CHAPTER 16\nTechnical Trading\nStrategy: Perfect\nOrder\nAperfect order in moving averages is deﬁned as a set of moving averages that\nis in sequential order. For an uptrend, a perfect order would be a situation\nin which the 10-day simple moving average (SMA) is at a higher price level than\nthe 20-day SMA, which is higher than the 50-day SMA. Meanwhile, the 100-day\nSMA would be below the 50-day SMA, while the 200-day SMA would be below\nthe 100-day SMA. In a downtrend, the opposite is true, where the 200-day SMA is\nat the highest level and the 10-day SMA is at the lowest level. Having the moving\naverages stacked up in sequential order are generally a strong indicator of a trending\nenvironment. Not only does it indicate that the momentum is on the side of trend,\nbut the moving averages also serve as multiple levels of support. To optimize the\nperfect order strategy, traders should also look for ADX to be greater than 20 and\ntrending upward. This represents a strong trend. Entry and exit levels are difﬁcult\nto determine with this strategy, but genera l l ys p e a k i n g ,w ew a n tt os t a yi nt h et r a d e\nfor as long as the perfect order remains in place and exit once the perfect order no\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER144longer holds. Perfect orders do not happen often, and the premise of this strategy is\nto capture the perfect order when it ﬁrst happens.\nThe perfect order seeks to take advantage of a trending environment near the\nbeginning of the trend:\n1. Look for a currency pair with moving averages in perfect order.\n2. Look for ADX pointing upwards, ideally greater than 20.\n3. Buy ﬁve candles after the initial formation of the perfect order (if it still\nholds).\n4. Initial stop is the low on the day of the initial crossover for longs and the high\nfor shorts.\n5. Exit the position when the perfect order no longer holds.\n■Examples\nFigure 16.1 is a daily chart of the EURUSD. In August 2014, the moving averages\nin the EURUSD formed a sequential perfect order. We check and see that ADX is\ngreater than 20, and we look to enter into a short trade ﬁve candles after the initial\nformation at 1.3390. Our initial stop is placed at the August 8 high of 1.3432. The\npair continues to move lower in the days and weeks that follow, and we remain in\nthe trade until the moving averages are no longer in perfect and the 10-day SMA\nmoves above the 20-day SMA, which occurs on October 17 when EURUSD settles\nthe day at 1.2758. The total proﬁt on this trade is 632 pips. We risked 42 pips on\nthe trade.\nThe next example is USDSGD. In Figure 16.2, the perfect order forms on\nNovember 6. We check and see that ADX is greater than 20, and we look to enter\ninto a long trade ﬁve candles after the initial formation at 1.2916. Our stop should\nbe at the November 6 low of 1.2911 but that is below our entry price so we put\nour stop at the 20-day SMA of 1.2822. The pair continues to move higher in the\nmonths that follow, and we remain in the trade until the moving averages are no\nlonger in perfect and the 10-day SMA moves below the 20-day SMA, which occurs\non March 27, when USD/SGD closes the day at 1.3685. The total move on this\ntrade is 770 pips for a risk of 89 pips.\nFigure 16.3 shows a perfect-order formation on a daily chart in USDJPY. The\nperfect order formed in October and when that occurred, we entered the trade\nﬁve days afterward at 116.20. Our stop was placed at 108.75, and we remained in\nthe trade until the 10-day SMA crossed below the 20-day SMA on December 19 at\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk145\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.1 EURUSD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk146\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.2 USDSGD Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER\nk\nk147\nk\nk\nFIGURE 16.3 USDJPY Perfect Order Setup\nSource: eSignal\nTECHNICAL TRADING STRATEGY: PERFECT ORDER148119.45. In this example, the proﬁt was 425 pips for a risk of 645 pips, which was\nfar from ideal.\nThe perfect order is a strategy that can be high proﬁt but low probability and\nlow frequency. This means there could be numerous stop outs before a long trend\nemerges. Also, when the currency pair moves more than 250 to 300 pips in proﬁt,\nyou may want to consider taking proﬁt on part of the positions.\n149CHAPTER 17\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nPairing Strong with\nWeak\nOne of the best ways to approach currency trading on a fundamental basis\nis to pair the strongest currency with the weakest. Of course ﬁnding that\npairing is rarely simple because it is not just about which countries are the strongest\nor weakest right now but instead which ones will become strong or weak going\nforward. Finding these currencies can also be challenging because we live in a global\neconomy where the health of one major economy will affect the outlook of another.\nYet buying a weak currency and selling a strong one unknowingly can be a big\nmistake that translates into large losses, so it is extremely important for forex traders\nto learn how to pair strong with weak to maximize returns. After doing so you can\nuse technical analysis to help identify points of entry in the direction of the trend.\nIn 2015, for example, the European Central Bank introduced quantitative easing\n(QE) as a last ditch effort to boost inﬂation and stimulate growth. We know that\nQE lowers interest rates and erodes the value of a currency but selling euros blindly\non March 9, 2015, when the central bank started buying bonds for the very ﬁrst\ntime, yielded only a short-lived decline in the currency. Instead it would have been\nsmarter to look for opportunities to sell the currency against a strong one on rallies.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK150\nFIGURE 17.1 EURGBP Daily Chart—Quantitative Easing\nSource: eSignal\nFIGURE 17.2 NZDCAD Daily Chart—Oil\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK151One good candidate at the time was the British pound, which was beneﬁting from\neconomic improvements and had a central bank that was moving closer to raising\nrates. Figure 17.1 shows how there was a lot of consolidation in EURGBP near\n74 cents prior to the launch of Eurozone quantitative easing. This level proved to\nbe resistance when the pair rallied in late March. Traders could have sold them,\nassuming that resistance would hold, or waited for the pair to revisit that level in\nApril and May.\nAnother way to pair strong with weak is to follow the direction of commodity\nprices. Oil prices bottomed at $43.46 in early 2015, having traded above $100 a\nbarrel only 8 months earlier and started to turn higher in March. As a major oil\nproducer, Canada would stand to beneﬁt from stabilization in crude prices. At the\ntime U.S. policy makers were talking about raising interest rates, the Australian\ndollar was beneﬁtting from improving domestic conditions, and sterling soared on\npositive data and a victory by the incumbent during the 2015 general election.\nSelling any of these currencies and buying the Canadian dollar would have been a\nrisky endeavor. Instead the best bet at th e time was to sell the New Zealand dollar\nand buy the Canadian dollar or the NZDCAD pair because New Zealand reported\nextremely weak labor data that prompted policy makers to talk about easing. As\nyou can see in Figure 17.2, NZDCAD started to turn lower just as oil prices moved\nhigher in March.\nFIGURE 17.3 EURUSD Daily Chart\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: PAIRING STRONG WITH WEAK152The best way to gauge strong versus weak is to monitor economic data surprises.\nWhile the ECB was buying bonds and implementing quantitative easing, Eurozone\ndata started to improve and U.S. data started to weaken. The market had not\nanticipated this shift in dynamic as they had been looking for weak Eurozone data to\nreinforce QE and stronger U.S. data to push the Fed to tighten. This unexpected\nchange drove EURUSD sharply higher, and buying breakouts in April and May as\nshown in Figure 17.3 would have been good bets.\n153CHAPTER 18\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nThe Leveraged\nCarry Trade\nThe leverage carry trade strategy is the quintessential global macro trade that\nhas long been one of the favorite strategies of hedge funds and investment\nbanks. On its most fundamental level, the carry trade strategy involves buying\na high-yielding currency and funding it with the sale of a low-yielding currency.\nAggressive speculators will leave the trade unhedged with the hope that the high\nyielding currency will appreciate in value relative to the lower yielding currency,\nallowing them to earn the interest rate differential on top of the capital appreciation.\nMore conservative investors may choose to hedge the exchange rate component,\nearning only the interest rate differential. Although the differentials tend to be small,\nusually 1 to 3 percent if the position is leveraged 5 to 10 times, the proﬁts from\ninterest rates alone can be substantial. Of course it is important to remember that\nwhile leverage can magnify proﬁts, it can also exacerbate losses. Capital appreciation\ngenerally occurs when a number of traders identify proﬁt opportunities and pile into\nthe same trade, driving up the value of the currency pair.\nIn foreign exchange trading, the carry trade is a popular way to take advantage\nof the notion that money ﬂows in and out of different markets, driven by the law\nof supply and demand: with markets offering higher rates of return on investment\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE154attracting the most capital. Countries are no different—in the world of international\ncapital ﬂows, nations that offer the highest interest rates will generally attract more\ninvestment creating greater demand for their currencies. This helps to fuel the\ncarry trade. The carry trade strategy is simple to master, but like all strategies,\nit contains risk. Carry trades perf ormed extremely well between 2000 and 2007,\nfailed miserably between 2008 and 2009, and recovered between late 2012 into\n2015. The chance of loss can be great if you do not understand how, why, and when\ncarry trades work best.\n■How Do Carry Trades Work?\nTo understand carry trading, it is important to ﬁrst understand that currencies are\nalways traded in pairs, so taking a carry trade involves buying a currency that offers\na high interest rate and simultaneously selling a currency that offers a low interest\nrate. Carry trades are proﬁtable when the exchange rate remains unchanged in\nvalue and investors are able to earn the d ifference in interes t—or spread—between\nthe two currencies, or when it appreciates in value, allowing the investor to earn\nthe spread along with capital appreciation. If the exchange rate falls by more than\nthe spread on the interest rate, it becomes a net loss for the investor.\nLet’s take a look at an example: Assume that the Australian dollar offers an\ninterest rate of 4.75%, while the Swiss franc offers an interest rate of 0.25%. To\nexecute the carry trade, an investor buys the Australian dollar and sells the Swiss\nfranc. In doing so, he or she can earn a proﬁt of 4.50% (2.75% in interest earned\nminus 0.25% in interest paid), as long as the exchange rate between Australian\ndollars and Swiss francs do not change. Figure 18.1 shows exactly how an investor\nwould execute the carry trade.\nLong Short\nBuy AUD\n4.75%Sell CHF\n0.25%Investor\nReceives: 4.75% from long AUD\nposition\nPays: 0.25% through short USD\nfunding position\nProfit: 4.50% in interest rate\nspread, assuming spot rate is \nconstantEnters long AUD/USD trade:\nFIGURE 18.1 Leveraged Carry Trade Example\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE155To summarize : A carry trade involves buying a currency that offers a high interest\nrate while selling a currency that offers a low interest rate.\n■Why Do Carry Trades Work?\nInterest rates are very important: Carry trades work because of the constant\nmovement of capital into and out of different countries in search of the highest yield.\nInterest rates are the main reason why some countries attract more investment\nthan others. There are three reasons why a country can pay a higher interest rate.\nFirst, if a country’s economy is doing well (high growth, high productivity, low\nunemployment, rising incomes, etc.), it will be able to offer those who invest in the\ncountry a higher rate of return. Second, central banks can raise interest rates on fast\ngrowing economies with rising inﬂation. Third, countries with high debt to GDP\nratios, low credit ratings, and/or inherent growth problems may also need to pay a\nhigher interest rate to attract investment.\nInvestors prefer to earn higher interest rates: Investors who are interested in\nmaximizing their proﬁts will naturally look for investments that offer them the\nhighest rate of return. When making a decision to invest in a particular currency, an\ninvestor is more likely to choose one that offers the highest rate of return, or in this\ncase, interest rate. If several investors make this exact same decision, the country\nwill experience an inﬂow of capital from those seeking to earn a high rate of return,\nand the currency should appreciate.\nWhat about countries that are not doing well economically? Countries that have\nlow growth and low productivity will not be able to offer investors a high rate of\nreturn unless they have a very poor credit rating and are forced to offer a higher\nrate to compensate for the risk of holding the country’s bond or currency. With\nmajor economies, however, there will be times where growth is so weak that\ninterest rates are brought to zero, providing investors with no meaningful return.\nThe difference between countries that offer h igh interest rates versus countries that\noffer low interest rates is what makes carry trades possible.\nLet’s take another look at the carry trade example above in more detail.\nImagine an investor in Switzerland who is earning an interest rate of 0.25% per\nyear on her bank deposit in Swiss francs. At the time, a bank in Australia is offering\n4.75% per year on a deposit of Australian dollars. Seeing that interest rates are much\nhigher with the Australian bank, this in vestor would like to ﬁnd a way to earn this\nhigher rate of interest on her money.\nNow imagine that the investor could somehow trade her deposit of Swiss francs\nby paying 0.25% for a deposit of Australian dollars paying 4.75%. What she has\neffectively done is to ‘‘sell’’ her Swiss franc deposit and use those funds to ‘‘buy’’ an\nAustralian dollar deposit. With this transaction, she now owns an Australian dollar\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE156Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.2 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 1\ndeposit that pays her 4.75% in interest per year, 4.50% more than she was earning\nwith her Swiss franc deposit.\nThis investor has essentially just done a carry trade by ‘‘buying’’ an Australian\ndollar deposit, and ‘‘selling’’ a Swiss franc deposit.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows out of\nSwitzerland and into Australia, as investors take their Swiss francs and convert them\ninto Australian dollars. Australia attracts more capital because of the higher rates it\noffers. This inﬂow of capital increases the value of the currency (see Figure 18.2).\nTo summarize : Carry trades are made possible by the differences in interest rates\nbetween countries. B ecause they prefer to ea rn higher interest ra tes, investors will\nlook to buy and hold high interest rate paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Work Best?\nThere will be times when carry trades work better than others. In fact, carry trades\nare the most proﬁtable when there is a very speciﬁc attitude toward risk.\n■How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take?\nThe moods of people in general change over time—sometimes they may feel more\ndaring and willing to take chances; other times they may be more timid and prone to\nconservativeness. Investors, as a group, are no different. Sometimes they are willing\nto make investments that involve a good amount of risk; other times they are more\nfearful of losses and look to invest in safer assets.\nIn ﬁnancial jargon, when investors as a whole are willing to take on risk, we\ncall this low risk aversion, which means they are in risk-seeking mode. Alternatively,\nwhen investors are drawn to more conservative investments and less willing to take\no nr i s k ,w ed e s c r i b et h e ma s risk-averse .\nCarry trades are the most proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion .T h i s\nnotion makes sense when you consider what a carry trade involves. Remember, a\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE157carry trade involves buying a currency that pays a high interest rate while selling a\ncurrency that pays a low interest rate. In buying the high interest rate currency, the\ninvestor is taking a risk because it is believed that a country needs to offer a higher\ninterest rate to offset the risk of holding th e currency. Also, while high interest rates\nattract investment, they can also hurt growth by raising the cost of borrowing. This\ncreates uncertainty around whether the economy of the country will continue to\nperform well and be able to pay not just high but even higher interest rates. This\nrisk is something a carry trade investor must be willing to take.\nIf investors as a whole were not willing to take on this risk, then capital would\nnever move from one country to another, and the carry trade opportunity would\nnot exist. Therefore, in order to return, carry trades require that investors as a\ngroup have low risk aversion, or be willing to bear the risk of investing in the higher\ninterest rate currency.\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the most proﬁtable when investors are willing\nto bear the risk of investing in high interest paying currencies.\n■When Will Carry Trades Not Work?\nSo far, we have shown that a carry trade will work best when investors have low\nrisk aversion. What happens when investors have high risk aversion ?\nCarry trades are the least proﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion .W h e n\ninvestors have high risk aversion, they are less willing as a group to take chances\nwith their investments. This means they would be less willing to invest in riskier\ncurrencies that offer higher interest rates. Instead, when investors have high risk\naversion they would actually prefer to put their money in ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies\nthat pay lower interest rates. During this time, they may also opt to close or unwind\ntheir carry trades. In doing so, they would be buying the currency with the low\ninterest rate and selling the curre ncy with the high interest rate.\nReturning to our earlier example, let’s assume the investor suddenly feels\nuncomfortable holding the foreign currency, the Australian dollar. Now, instead of\nlooking for the higher interest rate, she is more interested in keeping her investment\nsafe. As a result, she swaps her Australian dollars for more familiar Swiss francs.\nThe net effect of millions of people doing this transaction is that capital ﬂows\nout of Australia and into Switzerland as investors take their Australian dollars and\nconvert them into Swiss francs. During this period of risk aversion, Switzerland\nattracts more capital due to the perceived safety of its currency, and the inﬂow of\ncapital increases the value of the Swiss franc (see Figure18.3).\nWhen investors have high risk aversion, they prefer to avoid the riskier high\ninterest rate paying currency and instea d invest in the safer, lower interest rate\npaying currency, which is the opposite of a carry trade.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE158Value\nof\nAUDValue\nof\nCHFCapital\nFlowsInterest rate:\n4.75%Australia\nInterest rate:\n0.25%Switzerland\nFIGURE 18.3 AUDCHF Carry Trade Example 2\nTo summarize : Carry trades will be the least proﬁtable in periods of uncertainty\nwhen investors are unwilling to bear the risk of investing in high interest paying\ncurrencies.\n■The Importance of Risk Aversion\nCarry trades will generally be proﬁtable when investors have low risk aversion, and\nunproﬁtable when investors have high risk aversion. So before placing a carry trade\nit is important to understand the risk environment—whether investors as a whole\nhave high or low risk aversion—and when it changes .\nRising risk aversion is generally beneﬁcial for low interest rate paying currencies:\nSometimes the mood of investors will change rapidly, and investors’ willingness\nto make risky trades can change dramatically from one moment to the next.\nOften, these large shifts are caused by signiﬁcant global events. When periods\nof risk aversion occur quickly, the result is generally a large capital inﬂow into\nlow-interest-rate-paying ‘‘safe haven’’ currencies (see Figure 18.2).\nFor example, in the summer of 1998 the Japanese yen appreciated against the\ndollar by more than 20% over the span of two months, due to the Russian debt\ncrisis and LTCM hedge fund bailout. Similarly, just after the September 11 terrorist\nattacks the Swiss franc rose by more than 7% against the dollar over a 10-day period.\nDuring the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, we also saw big gains in the yen and the\nSwiss franc.\nThese sharp movements in currency values often occur when risk aversion quickly\nchanges from low to high. As a result, when risk aversion shifts, a carry trade can\nturn from being proﬁtable to unproﬁtable very quickly.\nRisk Aversion and Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nAs investor risk aversion goes from high to low, carry trades become more proﬁtable\nas detailed in Figure 18.4.\nHow do you know if investors as a whole have high or low risk aversion?\nUnfortunately, it is difﬁcult to measure investor risk aversion with a single number.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE1591 .

Low-interest currencies\ntend to remain weak, used in \nfinancing risky trades(–)( +)\nFIGURE 18.4 Carry Trade Proﬁtability\nOne way to get a broad idea of risk aversion levels is to look at bond yields. The\nwider the spread between the yields of bonds from different countries with similar\ncredit ratings, the higher the investor risk aversion. Bond yields are readily available\non major ﬁnancial websites such as Bloomberg.com and Reuters.com. In addition,\nseveral large banks have developed their own measures of risk aversion that signal\nwhen investors are willing to take risk and when they are not.\nOther Things to Bear in Mind When Considering a Carry Trade\nWhile risk aversion is one of the most important things to consider before making\na carry trade, it is not the only one. The following are some additional issues to be\naware of.\nLow Interest Rate Currency Appreciation\nBy entering into a carry trade, an investor is able to earn a proﬁt from the interest\nrate difference, or spread, between a high interest rate currency and a low interest\nrate currency. However, the carry trade can turn unproﬁtable if for some reason\n(like the risk aversion examples earlier), the low interest rate currency appreciates\nby a signiﬁcant amount.\nAside from rising risk aversion, improving economic conditions within a low\ninterest paying country can also cause its currency to appreciate. An ideal carry trade\nwill involve a low interest currency whose economy is weak and has low expectations\nfor growth. If the economy were to improve, however, the country might then be\nable to offer investors a higher rate of return through increased interest rates. If this\nwere to occur—again, using the previous example, say that Switzerland increased\nthe interest rates it offered—then investors may take advantage of these higher rates\nby investing in Swiss francs. As seen in Figure 18.3, an appreciation of the Swiss franc\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEG Y: THE LEVERAGED CARRY TRADE160would negatively affect the proﬁtability of the Australian dollar–Swiss franc carry\ntrade. (At the very least, higher interest rates in Switzerland would negatively affect\nthe carry trade’s proﬁtability by lowering the interest rate spread.)\nThis same sequence of events may currently be unfolding for the Japanese yen.\nGiven its zero interest rates, the Jap anese yen has for a very long time been an\nideal low interest rate currency to use in carry trades (known as yen carry trades ).\nThis situation however, may be changing. Increased optimism about the Japanese\neconomy has recently led to an increase in the Japanese stock market. Increased\ninvestor demand for Japanese stocks and currency has caused the yen to appreciate,\nand this yen appreciation negatively affects the proﬁtability of carry trades like\nAustralian dollar (high interest rate) versus Japanese yen.\nIf investors continue to buy the yen, the yen carry trade could start to become\nunproﬁtable. This further illustrates the fact that when the low interest rate currency\nin a carry trade (the currency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the\nproﬁtability of the overall carry trade position.\nTrade Balances\nA country’s trade balance (the differen ce between imports and exports) can also\naffect the proﬁtability of a carry trade. We know that when investors have low\nrisk aversion or are risk seeking, capital will ﬂow from the low interest rate paying\ncurrency to the high interest rate paying currency (see Figure 18.2) but this does\nnot always happen.\nOne reason is because countries with large trade surplus can still see their\ncurrencies appreciate in low risk environments because running a trade surplus\nmeans that the country exports more than it imports. This creates naturally demand\nfor the currency.\nThe point of this example is to show that even when investors have low risk\naversion, large trade imbalances can cause a low interest rate currency to appreciate\n(as in Figure 18.3). And when the low interest rate currency in a carry trade (the\ncurrency being sold) appreciates, it negatively affects the proﬁtability of the carry\ntrade.\nTime Horizon\nIn general, a carry trade is a long-term strategy. Before entering into a carry trade,\nan investor should be willing to commit to a time-horizon of at least six months. This\ncommitment helps to make sure that the trade will not be affected by the ‘‘noise’’\nof shorter-term currency price movements.\nTo summarize : Carry trade investors should be aware of factors such as currency\nappreciation, trade balances, and time horizon before placing a trade. Any or all of\nthese factors can cause a seemingly proﬁtable carry trade to become unproﬁtable.\n161CHAPTER 19\nFundamental\nTrading Strategy:\nMacro Event Driven\nTrade\nShort-term traders are generally focused only on the economic release of the\nweek and how it will impact their day trading activities. This works well for\nmany traders, but it is also important not to lose sight of the big macro events\nthat may be brewing in the economy or the world for that matter. Large-scale\nmacroeconomic events will move markets and will move them in very big ways.\nTheir impact goes beyond a simple one- or two-day price change because depending\non their size and scope, these occurrences have the potential to reshape the\nfundamental perception toward a currency for months or even years at a time.\nEvents such as wars, political uncertainly, natural disasters, and major international\nmeetings or monetary policy changes are so potent due to their irregularity that they\ncan have widespread psychological and physical impacts on the currency market.\nWith these events come both currencies that appreciate vastly and currencies that\ndepreciate just as dramatically. Therefore, keeping on top of global developments,\nunderstanding the underlying direction of market sentiment before and after these\nevents occur and anticipating them could be very proﬁtable, or at least can help\nprevent signiﬁcant losses.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE162■Know When Big Events Occur: Here Is a List\nof a Few Important Ones\n■Signiﬁcant G7 ﬁnance ministers meetings\n■Presidential elections\n■Important summits\n■Major Central Bank meetings\n■Potential changes to currency regimes\n■Possible debt defaults by large countries\n■Possible wars as a result of rising geopolitical tensions\n■Federal Reserve chairman’s semiannual testimony on economy\nThe best way to highlight the signiﬁcance of these events is look at a few notable\nmacroeconomic examples from the past two decades.\n2014 Ukraine–Russia Crisis\nThe 2014 Ukraine–Russia crisis was one of the biggest geopolitical events of the\npast decade. The crisis began in 2013 but didn’t really hit its peak until March\n2014 when Russia signed a bill to absorb Crimea. Leading up to the announcement,\nthe uncertainty put signiﬁcant pressure on the EURUSD in January 2014 with the\ncurrency pair dropping sharply on March 18, 2014, the day that Russia declared that\nCrimea was now ofﬁcially apart of their country. This led to a few more weeks of\ndownward pressure for the EURUSD as shown in Figure 19.1 as investors awaited\nthe world’s response. Many nations declared their support for Ukraine and war was\nfeared, but eventually Russia was only hit with sanctions, and a few months later,\nthe Ukraine crisis moved to the back burner.\nEuropean Sovereign Debt Crisis (2009–2013)\nThe European Sovereign Debt Crisis started in 2009 and lasted into 2013 with the bulk\nof the damage being done by February 2012. It was a multiyear debt crisis that was\nsparked by the inability of many member nations to meet their debt obligations after\nthe global ﬁnancial crisis. Their banking sectors and economies suffered signiﬁcant\nlosses, and persistently negative growth prospects made it impossible for countries\nsuch as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus to repay or reﬁnance their government\ndebt. Between 2010 and 2012, all of these na tions required bailouts or some form\nof support from the Troika, composed of the ECB, IMF and European Commission.\nWhile the problems were concentrated in smaller Eurozone nations, there was fear\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE163\nFIGURE 19.1 EURUSD Ukraine Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE164\nFIGURE 19.2 EURUSD Sovereign Debt Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nof contagion for the major economies. The country of Spain did not require a bailout\nbut in 2012, a number of banks required additional funding. The crisis posed caused\nsigniﬁcant volatility for the euro. Figure 19.2 shows two long periods of EURUSD\nweakness that were caused by bailouts, downgrades, and other negative headlines.\nGlobal Financial Crisis (2007–2009), Subprime\nOne of the most important macroeconomic events of the twenty-ﬁrst century was\nthe 2007 to 2009 subprime/global ﬁnancial crisis. It was triggered by a sharp slide\nin house prices, default on mortgages, and blowup of subprime mortgage backed\nsecurities and collateralized debt obligations. This, in turn, caused massive losses for\nbanks and ﬁnancial institutions, leading the failure of major ﬁrms such as Lehman\nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns. The impact on the ﬁnancial market and\nthe economy was staggering, with many countries falling into recession. During this\nperiod, the stock market lost more than 50% of its value with the S&P 500, falling\nfrom a high of 1,565 in October 2007 to a low of 676 in March 2009. As shown in\nFigure 19.3, USDJPY dropped from a high of 116.47 in October 2007 to a low of\n87.13 in January 2009. This was only the beginning of a multiyear decline for the\ncurrency pair. EURUSD had a delayed reaction, rallying strongly between October\n2007 and April 2008 as money ﬂowed out of the U.S. economy, and then falling\nsharply between July 2008 and October 2008 as the risk aversion and crisis spread\nto Europe.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE165\nFIGURE 19.3 USDJPY Global Financial Crisis\nSource: eSignal\nPolitical Uncertainty: 2004 U.S. Presidential Election\nAnother example of major events impacting the currency market is the 2004 U.S.\npresidential elections. In general, political instability causes perceived weakness\nin currencies. The hotly contested presidential election in November of 2004,\ncombined with the differences in the candidates’ stance on the growing budget\ndeﬁcit, resulted in overall dollar bearishness. The sentiment was exacerbated even\nfurther, given the lack of international support for the incumbent President (Bush)\ndue to the administration’s decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein. As a result, in\nthe three weeks leading up to the election, the euro rose 600 pips against the U.S.\ndollar. This can be seen in Figure 19.4. With a Bush victory becoming increasingly\nclear and later conﬁrmed, the dollar sold off against the majors as the market looked\nahead to what would probably end up being the maintenance of status quo. On the\nday following the election, the EURUSD rose another 200 pips and then continued\nto rise an additional 700 pips before peaking out six weeks later. This entire move\ntook place over the course of two months, which may seem like an eternity for\nmany, but this macroeconomic event really shaped the markets and for those who\nwere following it, big proﬁts could have been made. However, this is important\neven for short-term traders because given that the market was bearish dollars in\ngeneral leading up to the U.S. presidential election, a more prudent trade would be\nto look for opportunities to buy the EURUSD on dips rather than trying sell rallies\nand look for tops.\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE166\nPost Election -\nAnother 700\nPip Rally \n600 Pip Rally\nPre Election\n2004 Election\nNight\nFIGURE 19.4 EURUSD Election Trade\nSource: eSignal\nG7 Meeting Dubai September 2003\nThe G7 ﬁnance ministers meeting on September 22, 2003, was a very important\nturning point for the markets. The dollar collapsed signiﬁcantly following the meeting\nat which the G7 ﬁnance ministers wanted to see ‘‘more ﬂexibility in exchange rates.’’\nDespite the rather tame nature of these words, the market interpreted this line to be\na major shift in policy. The last time changes to this degree had been made was back in\n2000. Taking a step back, the countries that constitute the G7 are the United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, and France. Collectively, these\ncountries account for two-thirds of the world’s total economic output. Not all G7\nmeetings are important. The only time the market really hones in on the G7 ﬁnance\nministers meeting is when they expect big changes to be made to the statement. In\n2000, the market paid particular attention to the upcoming meeting because there\nwas strong intervention in the EURUSD the day before the meeting. The meeting\nin September 2003 was also important because the U.S. trade deﬁcit was ballooning\nand becoming a huge issue. The EURUSD bore the brunt of the dollar depreciation\nwhile Japan and China were intervening aggressively in their currencies. As a result,\nit was widely expected that the G7 ﬁnance ministers as a whole would issue a\nstatement that was highly critical of Japan and China’s intervention policies. Leading\nup to the meeting, the U.S. dollar had alre ady begun to sell off as indicated by the\nchart. At the time of the announcement, the EURUSD shot up 150 pips. Though\nthis initial move was not ve ry substantial, between Se ptember 2003 and February\nFUNDAMENTAL TRADING STRATEGY: MACRO EVENT DRIVEN TRADE167\n6% Rally\n14% Rally\nSept 22, 2003\nG7 Meeting\nFIGURE 19.5 EURUSD G7 Meeting\nSource: eSignal\n2004 (which was the next G7 meeting), the dollar fell 8% on a trade-weighted\nbasis, 9% against the British pound, 11% against the euro, 7% against the yen,\nand 1.5% against the Canadian dollar. To put the percentages into perspective, a\nmove of 11% is equivalent to approximately 1100 pips. Therefore, the longer-term\nimpact is much more signiﬁcant than the immediate impact as the event itself has the\nsigniﬁcance to change the overall sentiment in the market. Figure 19.5 is a weekly\nchart of the EURUSD that illustrates how the currency pair performed following\nthe September 22, 2003 G7 meeting.\nU.S. War Against Iraq\nGeopolitical risks such as wars can also have a pronounced impact on the currency\nmarket. Figure 19.6 shows that bet ween December 2002 and February 2003, the\ndollar depreciated 9% against the Swiss franc (USDCHF) in the months leading up\nto war. The dollar sold off because the war itself was incredibly unpopular among\nthe international community. The Swiss franc was one of the primary beneﬁciaries\ndue to the country’s political neutrality an d safe-haven status. Between February\nand March, traders began to believe that the inevitable war would turn into a quick\nand decisive U.S. victory, so they began to unwind the war trade.

Between 2007 and 2015,\nthe Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and\nthe Swedish National Bank all resorted to QE, and their decision had a signiﬁcant\nimpact on their currencies on both a short- and long-term basis.\nThe goal of quantitative easing is to keep yields low and to ﬂood the market\nwith liquidity. To do so, a central bank would create money by buying ﬁnancial\nassets such as government bonds from banks using electronic cash. This basically\n‘‘creates new money.’’ It also keeps yields low because bond prices have an inverse\nrelationship with yields and in giving banks money, the hope is that it will encourage\nlending and in turn lead to more economic activity. The jury is out on how\nmuch QE really helped these economies, but the inﬂuence on currencies was\nundeniable.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX170■U.S. Quantitative Easing\nAfter the ﬁnancial crisis, the ﬁrst major central bank to respond with quantitative\neasing was the U.S. Federal Reserve. In November 2008, the central bank launched\na $600 billion bond-buying program. The program was initially effective as the\neconomy improved, prompting the Fed to temporarily halt bond purchases.\nHowever, the economy never gained additional momentum and as such, the central\nbank returned with a second round of QE (dubbed QE2) in November 2010. The\nsize of the program matched the ﬁrst round. Unfortunately, more bond buys were\nneeded, and QE3 was launched in September 2012. Unlike QE1 and QE2, QE3\nwas an open-ended program. The central bank announced plans to purchase $40\nbillion in assets every month, and in December 2012, that amount was increased\nto $85 billion per month. The program lasted for ﬁve years, and purchases were\nﬁnally halted in October 2014. Figure 20.1 shows how each round of quantitative\neasing impacted the EURUSD. As you can see, each round triggered a sharp rise in\nEURUSD and—another way to look at it—weakness in the U.S. dollar. In 2008,\nthe month that QE1 was announced, EURUSD surged 17% from high to low.\nWhen QE2 was announced, the EURUSD began a rally that took the pair up more\nthan 20%. QE3 led to a similar uptrend with gains extended when the program\nwas increased.\n■UK Quantitative Easing\nQuantitative easing was launched by the Bank of England in March 2009. At the\ntime, the BoE pledged to spend 75 billion pounds over a three-month period buying\nUK assets, but the program continue d and between March 2009 and January 2010,\nthe central bank had spent 200 billion pounds. In October 2011, growth started to\nslow more dramatically with the economy facing a double dip recession. In response\npolicymakers voted to increase the QE program by another 75 billion. In February\n2012, the central bank added another 50 billion and the same increase was made in\nJuly 2012, bringing the total program to 375 billion pounds. Figure 20.2 shows how\nGBPUSD responded to each round of QE. What is interesting is that the sterling\nfell sharply in the run up to the March 2009 announcement. It extended lower\nafterward but rebounded in the months that followed. In 2011, 2012, and 2013,\nthe sterling rallied the month that QE was announced. One important thing to\nremember is that the Federal Reserve was also buying bonds and expanding its own\nQE program at the time, so the two offset each other to some degree, limiting the\nreaction in GBPUSD. More importantly, investors interpreted each round of BoE\nQE as positive for the currency because they hoped that the central bank’s efforts\nwould help to turn around the economy.\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk171\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.1 EURUSD US Fed QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk172\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.2 GBPUSD UK BoE QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk173\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.3 USDJPY Japan BoJ QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX\nk\nk174\nk\nk\nFIGURE 20.4 EURUSD EZ ECB QE\nSource: eSignal\nQUANTITATIVE EASING AND ITS IMPACT ON FOREX175■Japan Quantitative Easing\nThe phrase quantitative easing was ﬁrst used by the Bank of Japan in 2001. At the time,\nthey did not believe that the program was effective but after the ﬁnancial crisis, they\nsaid they would examine their asset purchase program. In October 2011 the Bank of\nJapan increased the program by 5 trillion yen which was a small sum (approximately\nUSD$66 billion) compared to the staggering amounts that other countries were\npurchasing. Then in April 2013, they announced a bold and aggressive plan to\nbuy 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen a year as part of Prime Minister Abe’s economic\npolicies. This program was later expanded to 80 billion yen a year. Unlike other\ncountries where the effectiveness of QE was debated, Japan’s bond buying program\nplayed a large role in turning around the economy. It also had a signiﬁcant impact\non the currency. In Figure 20.3 we show how the ﬁrst program yielded a very small\nresponse in USDJPY but when the Bank of Japan came out in size, USDJPY reacted\nquickly and aggressively with a move that extended even further when the program\nwas expanded.\n■Eurozone Quantitative Easing\nThe European Central Bank was the last major central bank to roll out quantitative\neasing. They were reluctant to do so for a very long time because structurally the\nEurozone is not set up for quantitative easing. Since there is no euro-bond, some\ncritics felt that it was not in line with the central bank’s mandate. However faced\nwith sluggish growth, stubbornly low inﬂation, and an interest rate already at zero,\nthe ECB had very few options. They publicly discussed the option months before the\nactual decision, giving the market plenty of opportunity to discount the move. In\nJanuary 2015, the ECB announced that they would spend 60 billion euros per month\nbuying private and public bonds. In March 2015, ECB President Draghi unveiled\nan aggressive 1 trillion quantitative easing program. As shown in Figure 20.4, both\nannouncements had a signiﬁcant impact on the currency, but EURUSD stabilized\nafter the second announcement (but only after falling 500 pips) because investors\nhoped that the aggressive program by the central bank would help turn around\nthe economy.\nWhile no additional quantitative easing programs are expected as of mid-2015,\nthe unwinding of these unprecedented measures in the coming years should have\njust as much impact on currencies as the initial announcement itself, providing an\nopportunity for forex traders."
